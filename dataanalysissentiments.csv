0,i am not a big fan of the many  many marvel films  the only reason i saw this one was that my oldest daughter insisted i watch it    and overall i was impressed by the movie  though i think it was enjoyable more for the insane eye candy than the story itself i could talk about the plot but just noticed that there are over 2000 reviews for this film  so  i'll just say that it looked great and would have been great to have seen it on the big screen  the story itself  though enjoyable  wasn't one that particularly grabbed me or impacted on me   possibly because it was so violent and frenetic that the film  as a consequence  lacked intimacy and humanity ,Positive
1,shaun (simu liu) and katy (awkwafina) are slackers in san francisco  well  they're chinese slackers which means that they still have jobs  they're just dead end jobs  unbeknownst to katy  shaun's real name is shang chi and he was trained from childhood to fight by his father xu wenwu (tony chiu wai leung) who has been conquering for a thousand years with the ten rings until he met the love of his life  shang chi's mother this is mcu doing an asian hero and it's actually pretty funny  awkwafina does her comedic thing  simu liu does a good every man performance but he's also a good straight man to awkwafina  i like the pairing although they may be better as friends  then the movie surprises with a comedic turn from ben kingsley  i love that part which gave the movie a comedic jolt  i wouldn't mind him popping up in other mcu stuff  the dragon fight is a little blah but those climatic battles are getting standardized anyways  this is a fine addition to the mcu and these are fun characters to add to the gang ,Positive
2,it was an okay movie  simu liu is the son of the seemingly immortal master of the ten rings   always good to see tony leung  and i hope he soaked disney   who winds up opposing his dad  and awkwafina is his slacker sort of girlfriend  they are fine in the leads  as is meng'er zhang as his sister  and michelle yeoh as their aunt    always good to see her  and i hope she soaked disney too i have grown increasingly fond of martial arts films over the last couple of decades  and the decline of the movie musical is the reason why  they don't make movies like that any more  and when they try  they're often embarrassing  people don't like the unreality of people bursting out into song  or expressing their emotions through dance  no  they prefer the solid commonplace of people floating through space to kick each other in the head  to me  the fight choreography is its own dance  and the fight between leung and fala chen when they meet and before they fall in love is a challenge dance as graceful as any between astaire and rogers there are problems aplenty with this film  there's an immense amount of exposition  starting off with twenty minutes of it in chinese  i'm not sure why ben kingsley as the fake 'mandarin' from iron man 3 is present except for a certain remnant of star power and connecting this to the rest of the mcu  still  with my expectations not set particularly high  i had a good time ,Positive
3,"shaun (simu liu) and katy (awkwafina) are parking valets underachievers in san francisco  katy refers to herself as ""the asian jeff gordon "" after a fight on a bus where shaun reveals himself as a martial arts fighter  the two of them travel to china so he can reunite with his sister (meng'er zhang) after six years  he was raised to be an assassin and to make a long story short  the opening sequence comes into play as they have to save the world marvel has done it again with graphics  special effects  characters  and the right blend of humor  i fell in love with katy who was our voice of reason and comedy  i was so afraid they were going to emma stone her to death  if you love what marvel has done in the past and are getting bored with them attempting to figure what to do after thanos  then this is must see ",Positive
4,i was not expecting that  i had visions of a film along the same lines as snake eyes  that was an out of date bagel  this was a four course banquet fast paced  energetic  and relentless  not particularly the genre i normally go to  or enjoy  but i loved every second of it  a visual masterpiece  superb acting  terrific musics  but it's produced in such a magical way  it is stunning i plan on seeing this again  just to understand a few bits a little more go and watch it  you'll love it  9/10 ,Positive
5,of course i am just riffing off  teasing and making fun of certain things with my summary line  though there is some truth in there too   especially if you consider the last third of the movie   quite fantastical  pun intended but there is so much more here  and while you may have seen the bus scene already (i imagine many times)  it still is quite the highlight and works wonders! because there is even more to it than the trailer/teaser revealed! as is with the plot and the characters of the movie i was able to watch it on an imax screen and let me tell you     wow! but also wow and much respect to marvel and feige and anyone involved that they dared to make the first ten minutes or so in chinese! and throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well   throughout! that gives it a touch of authenticity  how immigrants in america or anywhere else in the world grew up  i do the same with my greek and german/english it is also nice and while i am prone to be sarcastic  i really think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation   especially nowadays with anti asian hate/crime rising  all because of people blaming china and people of china for a virus     the movie does not have that as a topic  it is entertainment after all  but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned  good for them and good for us  that this was made i am a bit biased when it comes to the mcu and this did get a pure theatrical release  instead of the black widow treatment (which also was available on disney plus and the cinemas at the same time)  so there is not issue when it comes to that  and if you can watch it on the big screen   you will not be dissapointed! now waiting for the other stuff to drop     especially after the mid credit scene  that is such a tease     the after the credits scene might also hint at something  but the bigger tease was midway through the credits (actually almost at the beginning of them to be honest) sit back and enhoy the movie and the really funny characters     and quite a few familiar faces  some from the mcu and previous entries but also some from asian cinema! well done!,Positive
6,there seemed to be a lot of inconsistencies in the story line  and that brought the film's credibility down a notch for this viewer  for example  during the insane bus fight scene  wouldn't you say that the razor fist (florian munteanu) was trying to kill shaun (simu liu  before he was revealed as shang chi)? that's what it looked like to me  but later it turned out that he was a strong arm for shang chi's dad  xu wenwu (tony chiu wai leung)  wouldn't wenwu be just a little po'ed if the razor guy actually hurt his son?then there's the question of shang chi's martial arts ability  after dispatching how many dozen fighters on the bus and on the scaffold  he gets blown out by his sister xialing (meng'er zhang) at the golden daggers club  how? similarly  auntie nan (michelle yeoh) doesn't have much trouble showing him what's what with her more elegant  flowing martial arts style  it seemed like shang chi's ability got progressively worse as time went by  until the finale required him to rise to the occasion  and i can't for the life of me figure out why film makers can't make sure characters who use a bow and arrow get it right with the grip  when katy (awkwafina) takes up her archery practice  she squeezes the nock of the arrow between her fingertips  which is almost impossible with a high tension bow  the proper method calls for placing the nock between the index and middle finger on the bowstring  it allows for more accuracy  and you don't wind up with the arrow swinging up and down on the bow as you're trying to release it well  i guess that's enough ranting  the cgi special effects were quite astounding  i especially liked the colorful mythical creatures of ta lo  the martial arts sequences were exceptionally well choreographed as well  even though we know what's seen on screen is impossible in real life  the story itself was very much a rehash of hundreds of martial art film plots  which almost always seek vengeance for the death of a father  mother  mentor  master  take your pick  even with that  it's an entertaining picture to watch  as the ten rings concept is given time to play out here  and in the expected sequel as well  as for that  the very final after  after  after credits scene appears to position xu xialing as the replacement for her father wenwu at the head of the ten rings organization  we'll have to wait and see how shang chi manages to deal with that whole scenario ,Positive
7,"the marvel cinematic universe made a big impact with an almost all black cast in black panther  then this film came along and gave the world its first high profile asian superhero  and from the trailer i saw  it looked very exciting  basically  thousands of years ago  xu wenwu (tony leung) discovered ten mystical iron rings  granting its user immortality and other great powers  he establishes the ten rings organisation and throughout history conquers kingdoms and topples governments  in 1996  wanting to expand his power  wenwu goes in search for ta lo  a mystical heavenly realm inhabited by chinese mythological creatures  he travels through a magical forest to the ta lo village entrance but is stopped by guardian ying li (fala chen)  the two fall in love  but li leaves with wenwu when he is rejected by the villagers  wenwu abandons the ten rings  and they have two children  shang chi and xialing  when shang chi is seven years old (jayden zhang)  li is murdered by wenwu's enemies  the iron gang  wenwu once again wields the rings to massacre the iron gang  resumes leadership of his organisation  and has shang chi go through brutal training in martial arts  xialing from childhood (elodie fong) secretly copies this training  when shang chi is fourteen (arnold sun)  wenwu sends him to assassinate the leader of the iron gang  but shang chi is demoralised after fulfilling his mission and decides to run away to america  settling in san francisco and changing his name to ""shaun""  in the present day  shang chi (simu liu) works as a valet with his best friend katy (awkwafina)  who knows nothing about his past  they are attacked on a bus by the ten rings  led by high ranking agent razor fist (florian ""big nasty"" munteanu) who steal a pendant that shang chi was given by his mother  wenwu anonymously provides shang chi with the location of his sister and  fearing that the ten rings will go after xialing's matching pendant from their mother  shang chi decides to meet her  he reveals his past to katy  who insists on helping him  they find xialing (meng'er zhang) at an underground fight club in macau  which she founded after escaping from wenwu  the ten rings attack the fight club and wenwu arrives to capture shang chi  katy  xialing  and her pendant  they are taken to the ten rings' compound  where wenwu uses the pendants to reveal a magical map leading to ta lo  wenwu explains that he has heard li calling to him and believes she is alive and being held captive in ta lo behind a sealed gate  he plans to destroy the village unless they release her  when shang chi  xialing and katy object  wenwu imprisons them  also incarcerated is former actor trevor slattery (sir ben kingsley)  whom the ten rings imprisoned for impersonating wenwu  as the mandarin  and his hundun companion morris  who offers to guide them to ta lo  the group escapes and travel to ta lo  which exists in a separate dimension with various chinese mythological creatures  they meet ying nan (michelle yeoh)  li's sister  who explains the history of ta lo: thousands of years ago  the village was attacked by the soul consuming dweller in darkness and its minions but was saved by a chinese dragon called the great protector who helped seal the dark gate to the dweller's world  according to nan  the dweller in darkness has been influencing wenwu to believe li is still alive so that he will open the gate  shang chi  xialing  and katy join the villagers in training and preparing for wenwu's arrival  using outfits and weapons crafted from dragon scales  wenwu and the ten rings arrive and attack  wenwu overpowers shang chi and forces him into the nearby lake  then destroys the gate with the rings  some of dweller's minions escape  and the villagers join forces with the ten rings to fight them  shang chi is revived by the great protector  which leaves the lake to battle the minions  wenwu and shang chi fight once more  with shang chi gaining the upper hand  but he chooses to spare his father  the dweller in darkness escapes the weakened gate and attacks shang chi  wenwu saves his son  bequeathing him the rings before being killed by the dweller in darkness  the dweller in darkness is eventually killed by the combined efforts of shang chi  the great protector  xialing  and katy  following the battle  shang chi and katy return to san francisco where they are summoned by the sorcerer wong (benedict wong) to the sanctum sanctorum  in a mid credits scene  wong introduces shang chi and katy to bruce banner (mark ruffalo) and carol danvers (brie larson)  they discover that the ten rings are emitting a mysterious signal  in a post credits scene  xialing becomes the new leader of the ten rings after telling shang chi that she was going to disband the organisation  also starring ronny chieng as jon jon  tsai chin as waipo  yuen wah as master guang bo  jodi long as mrs  chen  dallas liu as ruihua  paul he as chancellor hui and tsai chin as katy's grandmother  with the voice of tim roth as abomination  liu is suited nicely as the lead hero  awkwafina is loveable as the hero's high spirited best friend  leung is interesting as the half hero half villain father  and there is good support from the likes of yeoh and kingsley  it is a simple story of a young man who must confront his past and use his mastery in weaponry based kung fu to save the world  the highlights are the fight on the speeding bus and the final epic battle featuring dragons and mythical monsters  i agree the excellent special effects may swamp a lot of what is going on  but a well written script  many fast paces sequences  moments of humour  and nods to past martial arts movies help to smooth things out  all together it is an entertaining superhero fantasy action  it was nominated the oscar for best visual effects  good!",Positive
8,"having seen the trailer for the 2021 marvel action movie ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" i must admit that of course i was going to watch it  but i feared it would just be another run of the mill over the top cgi fest but barred of proper contents marvel movie  yet  i opted to sit down and watch it  on the notion that it was a marvel movie  but also because of the cast that starred in it and yeah  this movie was over the top in terms of cgi  of course it was  because it is a marvel movie after all  but luckily this movie broke the formula of the archetypical marvel movie and this actually turned out to be the best marvel movie so far  well  at least in my opinion  why? well  because of the storyline and the fact that it mixed asian culture and lore into the marvel cinematic universe  and it was a much needed addition to an otherwise western focused series of movies the storyline told in ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings""  as written by dave callaham  destin daniel cretton and andrew lanham was certainly entertaining  and the movie didn't really have a dull moment  despite the fact that it was a movie that ran for 132 minutes  i thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie from beginning to end  and for me  this was a storyline with proper contents to it  that also included interesting characters and creatures visually then ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" blew me away  the cgi team really worked their magic with this movie and brought it to life in a very visually fulfilling way  lots of nice details and jaw dropping special effects  and the creature designs in the movie were off the charts  i really enjoyed seeing those brought to life on the screen the character gallery in ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" was interesting  and that applies for both the villain and good guy side and they had such a great cast ensemble put together for ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings""  with the likes of asian cinema heavy weighters such as tony chiu wai leung  michelle yeoh and wah yuen  but the movie was also nicely carried by simu liu  whom i was not familiar with prior to this movie  and also having awkwafina in the movie was just brilliant  because she put on a spot on performance with her comedy sidekick character  and it was interesting and nice to see ben kingsley return to reprise his character of trevor slattery ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" is a good combination of action and narrative storytelling  which made for a very wholesome movie  and it should be said that the action sequences were breathtaking to behold  so very  very nicely choreographed and executed on the screen  taking that traditional wuxia elements seen in asian movies and mixing it in with the archetypical marvel western based superhero movies i was more than genuinely entertained by ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" and it is certainly a movie that bolsters marvel's hold for me  as their movies tend to be super flashy with spectacular effects  but rather hollow in terms of proper entertainment and storytelling my rating of ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" lands on a well deserved nine out of ten stars  director destin denial cretton ensured that this 2021 movie takes the role of the single best marvel movie to date for me ",Positive
9,martial arts meets the mcu in shang chi and the legend of the ten rings  more crouching tiger than jackie chan  the plot for the film is kinda hum drum  the sort of mystical eastern fantasy cobblers that practically writes itself shang chi is the son of immortal  power hungry warlord xu wenwu (tony chiu wai leung) and li (fala chen)  a warrior woman from the hidden village of ta lo  after falling in love with li and becoming a father  wenwu gives up his wicked ways and packs away the ten legendary rings that gave him much of his power  however  after his wife is killed by his old enemies  wenwu once again wears the rings and trains his son to become an assassin  ashamed of what he has become  shang chi goes into hiding in america and becomes shaun (simu liu)  but his past eventually catches up with him when his father sends his army  the ten rings  to steal the pendants given to him and his sister xialing (meng'er zhang) by their mother  wenwu requires both pendants to reveal the way to ta lo  where he believes that his wife is being held captive by her people this marvel movie is at its most fun before the plot starts to get in the way and the cgi becomes too overbearing and intrusive: the early fight scenes   a battle on a runaway bus against a henchman known as razor fist  and a fight on some high rise bamboo scaffolding   deliver lots of impressively choreographed action that will please both martial arts fans and superhero addicts  awkwafina  as shang chi's loyal friend katy  provides some comic relief  but also gets stuck in with the action unfortunately  the film quickly goes downhill after the good guys make their way to ta lo  with a little help from tony slattery (see iron man 3) and a furry winged creature with no face  the inevitable battle between the villagers and wenwu's army is typical overblown marvel mayhem  but the massive cgi tsunami arrives when wenwu opens the inter dimensional gate that he thinks is holding li prisoner: instead of releasing his wife  he frees a swarm of flying tentacled soul suckers and their big bad boss the dweller  fortunately for the ta lo people  they have a massive magical dragon on their side  which wakes up and adds to the digital whizz bangery as technically impressive as the special effects are  i found the second half of the film visually overwhelming yet remarkably uninvolving   a whirlwind of pixels and noisy action without much substance 5/10  it was nice to see hk/chinese stars michelle yeoh  tony leung and yuen wah together in a marvel movie; i just wish it had been a better one ,Positive
10,i find this film very engaging from start to finish  i couldn't get my eyes off the screen! the kung fu is very good  and the visual effects are wonderful  i enjoyed every second of this film ,Positive
11,"i've said this before about marvel movies: they are a victim of their own success  ""shang chi"" had to follow up a decade and a half of quality mcu movies  so the same movie that would've been a smash 10 years ago isn't viewed quite the same today  the movie was good  but it failed to really separate itself ""the legend of ten rings"" as a title already sounds too much like lotr  and in fact it was something like it in that he with the rings had the power  xu wenwu (tony leung) had the ten rings which gave him near omnipotence  with the ten rings he could defeat entire armies and live forever  he decided to use the rings to become a tyrant he was willing to put his rings aside and grow old for the love of his life  a woman he found after living 1000 years  i thought it was a bit strange that it took the man 1000 years to find his true love  but i didn't dwell on it stranger than him taking a thousand years to find his true love was the woman who fell in love with him  she lived in a secret magical village in macao that was totally isolated from the rest of the world  she was a gentle benign character who had powers herself and was able to defeat wenwu when he came to essentially conquer her village  somehow  through their crouching tiger  hidden dragon esque battle they fell in love  maybe that makes sense for him being that he finally found someone who could defeat him  but it didn't make sense for this nearly pure woman to fall for a man with a 1000 year history of tyranny still  they wed  forsook their powers and started a family their family would be unceremoniously destroyed when an old foe of wenwu  a vicious gang  came by their house to get their pound of flesh and killed wenwu's wife  li (fala chen)  li could've attempted to barter with them for some sort of material exchange for their past losses  but instead she immediately decided she'd try to fight the entire gang and lost her life in the process  that would cause wenwu to don the ten rings again and return to tyranny so  if you're keeping score on wenwu's wife  1 ) she was smitten with a man who came to destroy her village and 2 ) she chose to fight an entire gang with no powers to speak of and with no attempts to negotiate i recognize that it was a plot device to advance the plot  but it could've been done a lot better and with more tact  her character never struck me as someone impulsive and/or not able to judge character yet she exhibited both flaws most of what i've covered was garnered throughout the movie via flashbacks  the real main character was saun aka shang chi (simu liu)  he was the son of wenwu and li  years later we see an adult saun  he lives in sf and is a valet  he is violently thrust back into the life he ran away from when his father's goons came for the pendant around his neck given to him by his mother  it was at this point we learned his backstory  of which i've given some already  we find out he also has a sister  xialing (meng'er zhang)  who disney not so subtly informed us she had to train herself to become a fierce warrior because of her gender  the two of them had been split up for close to twenty years when saun ran away after being trained to be an assassin by his father  he was fourteen at the time and she was ten when he promised her he'd be back  he never came back and when they met again in macao as adults she held the same ten year old bitterness against him for running away as though a fourteen year old should've been more reliable  she greeted him with a butt kicking that was twenty years in the making  it's clear that it never crossed her mind that he may have been killed  or maybe she would've considered his death a betrayal as well  either way it was a completely childish way to handle reuniting with your long lost brother the two of them would join forces along with saun's friend katy (awkwafina) and really quickly to stop their father  he was going to use the ten rings to breach a portal to another dimension which contained some soul sucking demons the introduction of demons to the movie did offer some excitement  it upped the stakes of everyone involved and thrust another marvel character into the role of saving the world saun would save the world with the help of his friends and family  some would die  but the most important characters lived  i was somewhat satisfied with the movie  the acting was commendable and awkwafina was good as the comic relief  ""shang chi"" may just be the placement of a singular brick to build to something bigger  i just hope what marvel is building towards is worth it ",Positive
12,"it's been ten years since shang chi(liu  charming  stoic) last saw his father  and leader of the criminal empire the ten rings  wenwu(leung  charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him  even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing)  that was also when he last spent time with his sister  xialing(zhang  a badass who deserves more screen time  honestly  i'd be very surprised if she didn't  in future projects)  he's joined by his friend katy(awkwafina  quirky  providing a lot of comic relief  something i'm told she's in general adept at)  for what can best be described as a tense reunion  which allows the movie to really mine the family melodrama  one of the best elements it has  i won't give away exactly what the antagonist intends to do  only that our hero has to stop him  however  he has to figure out how  maybe even if  that is even possible not quite  yet almost ""black panther for asian audiences""  this does a lot for representation(including for women  some of the best characters in this are female  in addition to the two that i've already mentioned  there is also ying nan(yeoh  wise))  it is positively drenched in chinese culture(the third act  while in ways it feels like it belongs to a completely different film than the first two  takes an especially deep dive into that  ultimately  it is presented through a western lens  and clearly we need to go further in this direction  still  it is a big deal that they put so much of it in an estimated $150 to 200 million major blockbuster  which will be seen by millions of people who would never consider watching an art picture  especially one focusing on a group they don't belong to)  to the point where countless times  when it makes sense  major characters in this speak mandarin to each other  rather than english  which it is subtitled into  and ""don't worry""  for those who think that the following is important: there are white people on screen  and they aren't made out to be ""less than"" the action(each sequence of which feels distinct  belongs with the rest  and is memorable) pays tribute to many different kinds of martial arts films  acknowledging that they are standing on the shoulders of giants  jackie chan  wuxia  etc  the choreography is matched in skill by the cinematography  not only are we seeing incredible fighting  the camera is dynamic  celebrating and highlighting how incredible it is  that *is* why you hire bill pope  the director of photography on the matrix trilogy  two of sam raimi's spider man entries  darkman and team america  the special effects are excellent  there are some issues with pacing  and certainly a chunk of this is composed almost entirely of flashbacks this features relatively brief but highly concentrated  surprisingly graphic gore(you know  there was a time when the fact that it's happening to beings that clearly are not human  wasn't enough to get away with this kind of thing with a pg 13 rating  pepperidge farm remembers)  as well as a little strong language  i recommend this to any fan of comic book movie adaptations  and people passionate about diversity hiring  8/10 ",Positive
13,"i really dislike marvel movies  they're formulaic  generic  and loud  they don't care about story  they just assume that the audience watching them has low enough standards that they'll be satisfied by a bunch of chaotic stuff thrown on the screen  and given their total dominance of box office and movie theater screens  i guess they're right every so often  one will get good reviews that suggest it's something a bit different compared to other marvel movies  and i'll get suckered into watching it because  hey  i want to have fun too! that was the case with ""shang chi ""but     uh     no     this movie is not very good  it starts out promising  i like awkwafina and enjoyed her until the movie decides to dump her  i liked the marriage of martial arts and the marvel universe until the action became a nonsensical mess  the visual effects that were oscar nominated are pretty good i guess  but who cares? all visual effects look the same these days  and none of them are very impressive unless they serve a good story needless to say  won't be seeing the obligatory sequel grade: b ",Positive
14,shang chi leaves san francisco with his friend katy in pursuit of old family secrets and discovers crime  danger  previously unknown family  quite a lot of wire fu  ancient myths  and a couple of faces familiar to those who follow the mcu this is the first mcu movie where i have been completely unfamiliar with the source material and  therefore not sure what to expect other than martial arts well  i've seen a fair number of martial arts movies (without seeking them out)  so the building blocks for shang chi are not unfamiliar but they are very engagingly assembled  the story is strong  with moral ambivalence playing a part  the action is extremely well choreographed and  at times   and in common with the settings and costumes   quite beautiful  this is a gorgeous film to watch  the effects are  as expected  first rate the script is good  with much more laughter than i expected  it is helped here by awkwafina   playing her typical raucous character she adds a welcome note of humorous disrespect  yet she also acts well and is sympathetically in tune with the plot and characters  michelle yeoh is stable and relatable  the leading character is  arguably  a little light on charisma  but this is not necessarily a bad thing given that one of the main plot threads is about shang chi finding himself ,Positive
15,without spoiling anything as this story stands by itself there's going to be a sequel and i really look forward to that  it was that good in my humble opinion  visually it was just stunning  great cgi's  very well choreographed fighting scenes  and a story that was most entertaining to watch  some might find it over the top but it's a marvel so what do you expect? to me this is one of marvels best movies yet if not the best  the acting was good as well  and that from the whole cast  i never heard of shang chi before but from now he has one more fan  shang chi and the legend of the ten rings won't disappoint a lot of people  unless you're just not into this genre of movies  a must see for the fans ,Positive
16,"started like a mix between martial art and the marvel universe  i found it something special and liked it a lot just until the journey starts and another world opens  from there on we came into a fiction world with dragons and monsters it's there that this flick lost my attention towards the story  it takes a while before the action comes back in  but once the fights are on  the effects are really stunning mixed feelings aboutthe result  not bada fter all but with the other world coming in  it lost some points in the rating for me nevertheless  some funny parts here and there added and they worked out fine gore 0/5
nudity 0/5
effects 5/5
story 3/5
comedy 1/5 ",Positive

20,'shang chi and the legend of the ten rings (2021)' is  essentially  exactly what you expect it to be  not only does it feel like a marvel movie  it feels like a literal disney movie as well  this is often detrimental to the overall affair  as the piece should have been much more unique than it ultimately is  and it makes for a much less interesting watch overall  however  the formula it follows has provided plenty of success in the past; this time is no exception  its highs are where you'd expect them to be  as are its lows  and there is an undeniable sense of fun  albeit cookie cutter fun  to be had  the film is an entertaining action adventure that follows a young man whose criminal father calls him and his sister back home in order to lay siege to the mystical village he believes is holding his wife  the protagonist's mother  hostage  the villain's motivation is a little underexplored yet entirely understandable  it comes from a believable emotional place and is more satisfying because of it  the relationship between the lead and his no good dad isn't explored as much as it could be  though  and the flick generally has a bit of a theming issue  the piece tries to tie its events directly into the wants and needs of its lead characters  but it does so in an unsatisfyingly half baked way and honestly would probably have been better if it played itself as more of a straightforward adventure ala most of the 'mission: impossible (1996 )' series  still  the touches of character development are appreciated and each lead player is written to be as likeable as possible  this  combined with the amicable performances  means that you care about the heroes even though you don't have all that much reason to  this keeps you invested in their stories throughout  the highlight of the entire affair is  for sure  its action  for the most part  the picture stays towards the right end of the practical to cg spectrum  the fights are never exactly realistic  per se  but they're based on competent choreography and clean camerawork  they're  more often than not  really entertaining  sadly  the flick inches closer and closer towards the wrong end of the aforementioned spectrum the longer it goes on  by the time it reaches its finale (which gives me major 'fast and furious presents hobbs and shaw (2019)' vibes for some reason)  it's clear that the balance it previously achieved is going to go out of the window  sure enough  its climactic battle is an entirely computer generated affair; it isn't all that compelling and goes directly against what made the movie so enjoyable to begin with  no matter how hard it tries to disguise it  it still ends with a big blue beam in the sky  still  the finale isn't exactly bad  it's just annoyingly intangible and feels a little forced in  even (as do the rather cringe worthy post credits scenes)  ultimately  this is a generic yet entertaining experience  its charming acting and exciting action are clearly its highlights  and its weakest aspects are still decent enough  it's a good movie  however  i can't deny that marvel fatigue is becoming more and more pertinent in my mind  you know what you're going to get before you get it  plus  the studio's insistence that it has to perforate every single outing with references to other  almost entirely irrelevant fare is really annoying  although most of their movies are at least okay  i find myself not caring at all about them  that's sad  really  considering that the mcu has produced some genuinely great pictures in the past  7/10 ,Positive
21,"watch this in imax!!!! the entire movie has an expanded aspect ratio  you're watching about 70% of the image on normal screens  plus on way smaller screens with worse speakers  i promise  it's worth it wowowowowow  this movie blew me away  i love it  a lot  from beginning to end  everything  i walked out of the movie so hyped  silent screaming under my mask as i walked to the car  it's been a while since i walked out of a movie this happy  i have so much to say i love the mcu (a lot)  but there are a few things that are frequently lacking  one of them is good fight scenes  they always have awesome action scenes  but specifically fight scenes are usually pretty good  only great in a few movies like civil war and winter soldier  and for the most part  fight scenes in american movies pale in comparison to asian cinema (ip man  the raid redemption  anything jackie chan) the fight scenes in this movie     how do i describe it    amazing martial arts that's fast but clear  filmed in creative and astonishing ways without a hint of shaky cam or quick cuts  against stunningly beautiful backdrops    phenomenal  and they continuously focus on the fights instead of cutting to a different scene after 5 seconds like i've noticed in the mcu this is by far the best fighting in the mcu and it's not even close  it has to be up there with the john wick series and netflix's daredevil as some of the best we've seen in america lately  i loved the first major fight scene so much that i was worried it would be the best one of the movie  far too early  lol  i be stupid sometimes  they're all amazing another frequent flaw in the mcu is lack of compelling villain  nope  the villain has full depth with clear motivations you can sympathize with  cool  charismatic  intimidating  and formidable  everything you want in a villain another area of improvement is the musical scores  most of them don't stand out  i think they learned  they're on a good streak with the shows and black widow  and now this  not only is it a great score  it fits perfectly in the movie and the individual scenes/moments  it's not as amazing as the loki score but it definitely elevated the movie  it feels unique to this new franchise still so much more to say  need to go faster  this is one of the best  maybe the best  story in the mcu  especially the way it's told  flashbacks can slow down a movie  but here they are some of the best scenes i loved all the characters  i loved all the casting choices  i loved the performances  there are scenes of dialogue that gave me goosebumps  all the emotional moments hit  all the callbacks hit  there isn't anything that didn't work for me  it fires on all cylinders lmao i didn't mention the cinematography  why would i wait this long? it's mesmerizing  a lot  throughout  it's candy for your eyes it's also nice to see well written comedy with jokes relevant to the scene and characters  it feels organic  as opposed to the ""insert joke here"" method we've been seeing more of  especially in far from home what's the opposite of formulaic? that's this movie  i never knew what to expect next (helps that i didn't watch a single trailer  they ruin movies)  definitely doesn't feel like a typical mcu movie  it has it's own unique tone and feel and character continuing what i said in my headline  i have this thing where i get goosebumps and start tearing up  not from an emotional moment  but from a scene being so incredible  especially action scenes  i don't know why it happens  don't know if it happens to other people  maybe it's partly because i can't risk blinking  that happened in this movie numerous times  like  ""this is the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life "" hyperbole  but mannnnn after endgame (basically) finished phase 3  i was so happy and satisfied with the mcu  but i wasn't sure they could ever recapture that magic again  i knew i would watch everything and it would probably mostly be awesome  but i wasn't expecting top tier stuff any more  lol  i be stupid sometimes  i am ecstatic to have that notion obliterated  as of now  this is a top 6 mcu movie for me  wow all in all  i adore this movie  you may wonder why i wouldn't give it a 10 after all this raving  10s are super rare for me  only 13 of them  and i watch thousands of movies  interstellar  inception  mad max fury road  etc  movies that shouldn't even be called movies  my 9s are rare too  they are my favorite movies  10s are my favorites of my favorites  the only superhero movies i've given 10s are the dark knight  the dark knight rises and civil war if you're still reading  wow you're awesome! i think this is my longest review other than interstellar i'm still in such a good mood  i can't wait to watch it again  in imax  i want to wait a week so it feels fresher  but i might not be able to!

22,"after a flashback  this movie jumps to a couple of slackers  shaun and katy  with shaun proving during a wild bus ride that he is much more than a car attendant  soon they're on a globe hoping adventure with world saving dimensions the martial arts choreography is terrific  from the opening forest fight through that fantastic bus bit to the final hand to hand battle (followed by the big special effects battle seemingly required in every marvel film)  fights are funny and exciting and that final battle is truly suspenseful the cast is also excellent  awkwafina is as funny as ever  michelle yeoh and tony leung bring all their seasoned expertise to their roles  and the actors are don't know are also first rate although     in the case of simu liu  who plays shaun/shang chi  i have no strong opinion  he's a pleasant every man who handles the action scenes well but seems less mythic hero than ""genial best friend of the main character "" with all the other talent on screen he doesn't manage to leave much of an impression  but on the bright side i don't object to him the story is fun  the movie does a good job of mixing humor  action  and tragical reminiscences the pace is terrific  and man there are some great fights  recommended ",Positive
23,it was good  so far  it's in my top10 list of 2021 movies  however  i wasn't rly hooked up  jokes seemed to be outdated  some scenes were rushed  i liked visuals but that's it  i expected more from marvel ,Positive
24,"shang chi was nowhere near the top of my most anticipated mcu films over the years but it just about surprised me more than any of their films to date  loaded with pulse pounding action (most in camera for once)  a friendship turned possible romance you genuinely care about  and a lead that you can absolutely see taking the place of someone like chris evans as the ""face"" of the mcu for years to come  what an absolutely brilliant work of art 9 2/10 ",Positive
25,with no real concept of the character or the story  i didn't really know what to expect from shang chi and the legend of the ten rings  i was pleasantly surprised  this marvel action film is above average  and features impressive visuals  engaging action scenes  and entertaining characters  there are some missing pieces in the story  which they may be saving for later  but overall  i enjoyed this introduction to a new mcu superhero ,Positive
26,ever since marvel took every venerable property in their vault and burned it to ashes  they have been seeking a brand new formula  this time they may have found it  light and fluffy with a solid entertainment center  destin daniel cretton has some serious skills ,Negative
27,despite following the marvel formula to a tee  shang chi & the legend of the ten rings manages to bring a certain freshness to its cinematic universe with its expertly choreographed moments of action and a fully committed asian ensemble led by tony leung  the film isn't without its shortcomings and also gets carried away with its cgi set pieces during the final act but the journey as a whole remains a mostly fun  amusing & satisfying affair  definitely amongst the better entries in the marvel canon ,Positive
28,"this movie features the lesser known marvel superhero shang chi  who's a former assassin from china hiding out in the usa  he goes back to china when assassins come after him  who are also after his sister  it turns out his father is the real mandarin who sadly doesn't get to meet iron man  his impersonator from ""iron man 3""  played by ben kingsley is there and is a lot of fun  it's a nice throwback to the older marvel films and a good way to satisfy the fans  i like how there's two people of the same gender who are not love interests we get some absolutely amazing fight scenes which seem right out of a classic chinese martial arts movie  my only complaint is that it is a bit too long  it's still amazing with gorgeous designs of the creatures  it truly is a unique film to have a mostly all asian cast in a superhero movie  i recall an interview when the actor said a lot of chinese people are called bruce lee  that makes the documentary ""the problem with apu"" even more idiotic  ***1/2 ",Positive
29,it was a much more entertaining movie than i expected  i loved the movie  martial art scenes were very good  it was a different movie  of course it has its bad sides  but i like it anyway  music was good  acting wasn't bad  i was very curious about the history of the rings  i loved this character  also his sister was great  i would love to see more about ten rings  anyway  the movie wasn't bad  when this movie came to the cinemas  unfortunately  the cinemas were not open in my country and i would like to watch this movie in the cinema ,Positive
30,lots of copied ideas from other films  and poorly executed  very tossed together & cheaply not realistic the usual opening scene of vast armies on plains with the usual barrage of arrows  the army of the ten rings is led by the usual immortal who  as usual  steals ten arm bracelets which as usual are suppose to be hidden because of their power to  as usual bring immortality & create immense destructive force  the seen before disney style fantasy creatures (same old lion  horse  dragons  odd little creatures)  the usual electrical  laser  and pressure force as our weapons  redundant  boring  cheap to digitally reproduce  possessor supposedly over a thousand + years develops an army that for centuries (up until now) has spread to every corner of the world (odd  i never heard of them) ,Negative
31,"sorry for the delay here we go   i'm not feeling this movie  it starts with promise but it lost me after wong vs abomb the fighting is exciting  the movie lacks excitement though  it's a plain dull movie it's about a karate master and    yeah the movie lost me and i have know idea what it's about  this is the first mcu film that i lost interest for midway  even im3 wasn't so bad because i lost interest from the very beginning gotg2  mcu spiderman 1/2 and im3 are still the worse in mcu  shang chi just joined the club a movie so full of emptiness that it makes an empty box jealousi'm not sure how this is a 7  fans and the average movie goer should also be held responsible for horrible movies this movie ain't a 7 even if you watched this movie as blind and drunk they tried to be funny by having wong be rude by drinking the couple's drink at the end credit scene  that wasn't funny at all  wizard or not speaking of funny  i didn't laugh once  when i used to watch these movies in theatres  the audience often told me when i should have laughed  i watched it at home  therefore i didn't know my cue of when to laugh the mcu needs to chill with the daddy issue plotthor loki daddy issue

32,"greetings from lithuania ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" (2021) is definitely one of my favorite marvel movies  i loved fighting scenes   this is first ting what separated this movie from the bunch  also i liked the story (i haven't read comics)  acting was good by everyone  action scenes (and there are plenty of them) were simply amazing  this is a one spectacular looking movie overall  superbly paced at running time 2 h 5 min this movie never dragged  special effects were amazing  as well as technical stuff of this movie including terrific cinematography  ""shang chi"" is a superbly entertaining popcorn escapism ",Positive
33,"""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" is an action   fantasy movie in which we watch a new era of marvel studios rise with shang chi  the master of kung fu  he has to face his past involving him with the ten rings organization and crate his future accordingly i have to admit that i had my doubts about this movie but i was proven very wrong since it's an amazing movie  it has a beautiful and very interesting plot that keeps you in tense through its whole duration consisted of plenty of action and nice cgis  for one more time marvel succeeded on creating a nice atmosphere and connecting the previous movies with this one with many easter eggs so  we expect more in the near future  the interpretation of simu liu who played as shaun / shang chi was simply outstanding and he made the difference  some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were tony chiu wai leung's who played as xu wenwu  michelle yeoh's who played as ying nan  meng'er zhang's who played as xialing and awkwafina's who played as katy  the comic relief role of ben kingsley as trevor slattery was a brilliant idea that also gave something different in the movie  finally  i have to say that ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" is an amazing movie and i strongly recommend everyone to watch it  especially the fans of marvel ",Positive
34,shang chi and the legend of the ten rings (2021) is a movie my wife and i recently watched at the theatre  the storyline for this movie follows a young man and his best friend who work as parking attendants and are one day attacked by super villains  as they dig into the young man's past they discover his father is behind the attack with the purpose of hopefully brining his family back together  this movie is directed by destin daniel cretton (just mercy) and stars simu liu (blood and water)  tony chiu wai leung (infernal affairs)  ben kingsley (iron man 3)  michelle yeoh (crouching tiger hidden dragon) and awkwafina (crazy rich asians)  the storyline for this movie is way better than it should be and has crazy depth around all of the characters  you really understand the what  when and why behind every circumstance and perspective  the acting is outstanding and the characters are perfectly portrayed  the special effects are awesome both in terms of the action scenes and backdrops  the dragons may have been a bit overdone; but other than that  a++++  the choreography was also excellent and seeing yeoh in this really made me smile  this movie is way better than it should be and is a worthwhile addition to the marvel universe  i'd strongly recommend it  i'd score this a solid 8/10 ,Positive
35,daniel destin cretton created a tranquil really well filmed marvel story driven fun time! simu liu and a surprise character were the best along awkwafina which is always delightful  i really appreciate the direction of everything especially the effects  action  cinematography  and the silliness is good! might be odd or understandable this is one of the best marvel films ,Positive
36,i liked the first half of this film and i thought it was a fine addition to the marvel cinematic universe  the backstory with the father and the mother was a nice wuxia inspiration and a cool way of introducing the chinese theme to marvel  the protagonist and awkwafina had a believable friendship that struggled to balance enjoyment with living up to expectations  the tensed family relationship was a great focus as the father's gravity and charisma almost matched that of thanos and feels like a truly deep human being  throughout  the fight choreography was amazing  especially the bus scene the second half was an obligatory cgi mess that takes the focus away from the family relationship  the epic legendary city of ta lo (chinese version of wakanda) is about thirty people living in a wooden village  that's all that stands between the world and a world destroying demon  apparently  the hyped up final battle involves about ten soldiers with tasers  wasn't the ten rings supposed to be a world spanning empire? the fight between the dragons was so fast paced that i couldn't tell what was going on that said  there are flaws that occur in both of the halves  the ten rings (the organisation) is very vague in its nature and impact  why are they so feared? how have they taken over the world? what are they capable of? show  don't tell! the ten rings (the artifacts) don't seem to do much beyond flying around and projecting energy  this is cool  but it seems like a step down from other cosmic jewellery and probably didn't deserve the praise in the post credit scenes p  s  trevor and morris were definitely highlights of the film! keep this up  marvel!,Positive
37,i was somewhat surprised that the ten rings came back  i knew that they existed  and had been villains in a past mcu film  but a part of me wasn't expecting to see them again  that is until i saw the title of this film  mind you  a part of me suspected that the ten rings were more of an iron man villain  but in the end i'm certainly not all that much of a fan of comics books  and i have certainly never really managed to get into them  sure  i have purchased a couple over the years  but honestly  they have never really impressed me  at least the superhero comics  which seem to pretty much dominate most comic book stores these days the thing with shang chi is that it comes across a lot of a well made hong kong action flick  which i suspect was the intention  it is in part big trouble in little china (which is probably why a part of the film was set in san francisco  but also probably because san francisco has a pretty large chinatown)  in another sense this film was much better produced than the old hong kong films  and as such reminded me more of crouching tiger hidden dragon  but i suspect that this was done on purpose  namely so that it simply doesn't become just another superhero film  and in that regards shang chi certainly does play quite well into that so  the story centres around this guy who discovers ten rings  an item that gives him immense power  and also immortality  thus he builds up and army called the army of the ten rings  and pretty much conquers the world  however  he hears of another realm full of mythical animals and decides to go and find it  but gets into a fight with the guardian  during the fight they fall in love and have children  however she is killed  and after he trains up his son up as a warrior  he orders his son to kill the head of the iron gang  but his son refuses and flees to the united states to work at a fancy hotel this is basically an origin story  but much of it has to do with him fighting his father  who is the true mandarin (if you remember from iron man 3  there was this guy known as the mandarin  but it was just an actor that was acting as a cover for somebody else  and it then turns out that that particular mandarin wasn't the true one as well)  as for the army of the ten rings  they appeared in iron man i  being the group that kidnapped tony stark to get him to build them some weapon systems  but other than being a terrorist organisation  they didn't play all that prominently in the films after that i'm a little loath to simply say that this is just another superhero film  because as i previously mentioned  there is a lot of the kung fu film feel to it as well  however  i guess the problem is that we are probably reaching the point where there is starting to be quite a bit of superhero fatigue  then again  there has been a number of films released this year that had been put on hold due to the pandemic  however  i did find that this film was still quite fun  and while it sort of runs alongside your typical marvel script  there is enough in this film to actually make it somewhat different  it was okay  just not particularly great  oh  i should mention that there were some nice lines in it nonetheless ,Positive
38,"for the asian martial art genre  the evolution from kung fu to wire fu to cgi fu is something to behold  ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" in fact has a bit of each  but then  it is much more than being just the latest addition to this genre  it is a re assurance to fans that there is life after avengers  it is one of the opening shots (another is spiderman  and there are more coming) into the new marvel cinematic universe  as well  it introduces more minority superheroes after black panther  there is indeed already one yellow  but wong is only a sidekick to dr  strange  i used the word ""yellow"" not in any disrespectful way  but rather in the context that there is even a green among the major avengers  why not a yellow then  or two?the cast is solid  carrying but not leading the movie are seasoned veterans tony leung (the entire movie) and michelle yeoh (the second half)  playing the protagonist  simu liu is surprisingly good  toggling effortlessly between poignancy and levity  whatever role she plays  awkwafina gives credibility to the character in a way that is a pleasure to behold  meng'er zhang is well cast  i think of liu yifei when zhang's character appeared  but liu  arguably prettier (""arguably"" because it's all in the eye of the beholder)  would not have the right mix of defiance and vulnerability that zhang capably delivered  fala chen has a heavier role than i expected and handled it capably  icing on the top of the cake  somewhat of cameo roles are ben kingsley  yuen wah (an iconic martial art actor to those who are familiar with this genre) and benedict wong  i thought wong is just a cameo at the beginning but he has a pivotal role in the end credit teaser  together with brie larson and mark ruffalo  introducing our two protagonists into the post avengers mcu deftly directed hawaiian born destin daniel cretton  the movie sets up the story in two vo sequences  the opening sequence  rich with visuals  is narrated by li (chen)  telling the story of the rise of xu wenwu (leung) who acquired amazing power upon coming into possession of the magical ten rings (not small ones worn on fingers  but large ones worn on the forearms  five each)  after conquering through space and time  xu seeks the mysterious lands of ta lo  finds it  and finally gets beaten by someone endowed with ta lo magic  still in the vo  li reveals that this is herself  and adds  ""and that is where i met your father""  after some further  somewhat vague  information  we move on to present day in san francisco  shaun (liu) and buddy katy (awkwafina) work as happy go lucky parking lot valets who take patrons' vintage vehicles left in their care for joy rides occasionally  well  maybe not just occasionally  we don't know  the relationship between this pair  while warmly affectionate  seem platonic  at least at this point  provoked to a maddening melee in a cable car  shaun reveals an entirely different persona to katy  next thing you know  he has to go to macau before his father xu hurts his long lost sister xialing (zhang)  katy won't let him off the hook so easily  ""you can explain it on the plane"" she quips so here comes the next vo sequence  again with rich visuals  in which shaun explains to katy that he is really shang chi  who  after mother's death  ran away from despotic father  abandoning his little sister in the process next stage  macau  where shang chi finds that xialing  abandoned by him  has made it on her own  creator and owner of a plush fight club  and hating him for abandoning her  next thing  xu shows up  take the trio to his empire to join him in his scheme to find and burn down ta lo  to rescue his wife who he believes is not really dead but just held captive by her own people  the trio escapes  finds ta lo first to warn shang chi's aunt  ying nan (yeoh)  who is now in charge  from here on  it is building to the climactic clash the story is told with ably crafted narrative  together with capable acting  beautiful cinematography  and good cgi  the kung fu style action is a welcomed new alternative to action sequences in the usual superhero movies  all in all  this is a worthy re opening of the mc universe  more  please ",Positive
39,5 out of 5 stars shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is an awesome and exciting mcu film that brings the stunning world with the asian culture  i will say i enjoyed this more than the previous mcu film black widow  shang chi introduces a new mcu character played by simu liu  and awkwafina which is also a fun addition  while they are being chased by an organization called ten rings  lead by his father tony leung  while shang chi learns his abilities and the ten rings  before his father is trying to use that power for a personal reason great epic plot  shang chi and katy (awkwafina) enter a hidden world ta lao where there is magical mythical creatures  is like a wow stunning moment when you first see wakanda in black panther  the film does give an emotional story build up and a villain that can be relatable the cast ensemble is great  simu liu did great with the character along with awkwafina as his friend  meng'er zhang  michelle yeoh  benedict wong  florian munteanu  and tong leung all did great the set designs and visual effects are stunning and great  can be colorful at moments  the music score was good as well  the action sequences are great and exciting  every set piece had an awesome martial arts choreography which was well shot with the cinematography  director did a great job in capturing the action and fight sequences  even with the epic climax of the dragon battle there are two mid and post credit scene which sets up for further films and has a fun nod to the mcu i will say shang chi is a great exciting addition and i found the film to be very fast moving  action packed  and a great family conflict story that is emotionally driven ,Positive
40,the opening fight scene is worth the watch  but the cameos steal the show  i won't go in to detail  the marvel geeks will know what i mean  because there are plenty to count even the hidden ones the movie is good and i like the casting  the direction is okay but the cinematography is the best the ending is anti climatic  i found it to be cliche  however it is worth the watch  it is nice to see a movie like this and i believe it is a good addition to your watch list ,Positive
41,showing no signs of slowing down hot off the heels of black widow  a raft of well received disney+ series and arriving not too far in front of the hotly anticipated the eternals  marvel continues to put in work that puts many other wheelhouses too shame  with the marital arts infused shang chi and the legend of the ten rings  yet another entry into the brands increasingly loaded catalogue of quality blockbuster releases it's hard to pinpoint exactly what marvel keep doing to maintain the momentum that started all those years ago with 2008's iron man  it's absolutely correct when many say a lot of these origin stories and event pictures follow a very set formula from a to b  but with an ability to attract some of the best actors working in the industry today and handpicking a raft of some of the most exciting hollywood filmmakers around  marvel have once more struck gold with the incredibly fun and inventive shang chi quite possibly the most visually sumptuous marvel film yet  sometimes feeling as if marvel has meet with ang lee/yimou zhang and in my mind the marvel film that features the best choregraphed action scenes yet from the spectacle heavy brand  shang chi is a big screen blast that is freshly directed by the upcoming destin daniel cretton who here has got his just rewards after his great debut short term 12 and the sadly undervalued the glass castle came before this big budgeted ride infusing his film with a great energy and charm that is enhanced by the work of leads simu liu (in a career launching turn) as our likable hero shaun/shang chi  awkwafina (doing her usual but fun schtick) as shaun's bestie katy and tony leung as the unfortunate villain of the piece xu wenwu  cretton has turned out to be the perfect choice to start off the cinematic journey of the fist swinging shang chi and helps instill in his film some nice differences to what we've come to expect from comic book blockbusters of the modern era most notably for the film is the exciting use of hand to hand combat that is delivered spectacularly in two stand out sequences on board a moving bus and then bettered alongside a high rise building in macau  both these set pieces are easily some of the most noteworthy of any marvel film yet while also benefiting the film other than its asian infused eccentricities is the fun relationship between shang chi and katy than never bothers with adding extra baggage to add weight to their believable and fun friendship if there was a major drawback to shang chi's many wins it is in an overdrawn finale  a major problem many have acknowledged previously when it comes to marvel films  cretton and his team can't quite stick the landing for shang chi with it being a little too long in the tooth for its own good and slightly overblown and while it features some incredible imagery and technical wizardry  the films rip roaring start and strong middle section gives way too something lesser final say  another huge win for marvel who have here with the help of director destin daniel cretton and his talented cast  created an instantly likable cinematic universe that provides the comic kings with one of their most unique and exciting playgrounds yet 4 chicken pigs out of 5 ,Positive
42,"shang chi and the legend of the ten rings (2021) :
brief review  yet another superb stand alone superhero flick in mceu's kitty  mceu's new phase never looked so promising but their products are delivering better than expected  that spider man flick in 2019  right after endgame  changed many perceptions about marvel's future and even though couple of their recent series like 'wanda vision' and 'loki' couldn't emerge as clear winners  they have set a solid base for upcoming new stories  shang chi is a new start by all means  not only because it comes under new phase but mainly because it is a stand alone film and with a new superhero who is more like using traditional combat methods along with ancient superpowers  when captain america or black panther begun as stand alone films  they promised too much and thankfully fulfilled it  shang chi does the same  it may not promise too much like steve rogers and wakanda stories but the point where it ends surely gives us hints of new assembled version of superheroes in multiverse  shang chi  the master of unarmed weaponry based kung fu  is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the ten rings organization  the film has major portion covered by family values and hence  it may look predictable but does not bore at all  yes  few scenes are outdated and too dramatic as if we are watching a superhero film made in 90s but let's just forget those weak points as shang chi has excelled in visual spectacle  the screenplay could have been better in the second half when the big war was supposed to take place but it actually looks tiny one except for those two humongous dragons which might remind you of 'the hobbit'  performances by simu li  awkwafina  meng'er zhang  fala chen  florian munteanu are fine according to less potential available for the roles  actually  the humour and tone of these characters was great  they all looked normal people when they were not fighting and even though the film has ancient refrences  the character don't actually go too deep to become expressive  director destin daniel cretton seemed slightly off track in the beginning when he tries to humanise all the characters with that typically teenage humor but as the film goes ahead  he recovers from the childish entanglement  with super explosive climax he surely makes up for his mistakes  rather makes us forgive it  overall  shang chi is another superb entertainer for marvel fanboys and even neutrals are gonna enjoy it rating   7/10*by   #samthebestest ",Positive
43,"for the first time in a couple of years  since 2019's ""captain marvel"" the mcu introduces us to a brand new hero  simu liu who  rather impressively  first asked for the role on twitter brings us shang chi in a film that perhaps does have some issues with it's ending  but ultimately is a fun  funny ride of the type marvel have been perfecting for the last 13 years talented  but somewhat aimless  shaun (simu liu) lives in san francisco working as a valet with his friend katy (awkwafina)  when he's attacked on a bus  he's forced back into the world of his father  a ruthless terrorist xu wenwu (tony chiu wai leung)  first visiting his sister  then returning to the ten rings compound  shang chi decides to use his skills to defend his late mothers sacred homeland against invasion from his father and for control of ten mystical arm rings  weapons that grant their owner immortality and unearthly power if ""black widow"" was considered a wobble for the mcu  despite the fact i thought that it's a perfectly fine film  then it was important to come back with something that was undeniably excellent  ""shang chi"" was that  it's the perfect balance of humour and action that marvel have established over the last few years  the action too is tweaked slightly  to more closely resemble the types of asian led action films that we've seen previously  be that the jackie chan style bus fight  or the ""crouching tiger  hidden dragon"" esque flashback fight between shang chi's parents  there's some lovely links to the wider mcu  including a return for benedict wong's wong and for trevor slattery  ben kingsley's ""iron man 3"" character whose masquerading role as the mandarin was one of the mcu's most divisive moments it's not perfect  the ending is perhaps a little rushed and lacking a moment or two of redemption earning for xu wenwu  but the peaks at the future for the character  and for the 10 rings organisation is an interesting addition  plus our first real step on what might be the route to the next big bad  excellent stuff ",Positive
44,the story was riddled with holes and plot issues  since when does awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the mcu team? what's her super power    stupidity? don't get me wrong  i love her  but her character was lazily written  then there's the whole daddy issues dynamic   shang is with him  then against  then with etc   then we have these ridiculous dragons fighting  where one scores some power crystals and becomes stronger! this is just infantile lazy writing  there was zero shock value or anything spectacular in the entire runtime  with tedious long middle acts and a bumbling third act  the jokes were cliched and not funny  the funniest parts were ben kingsley's character  (of whom was in this for what reasons??) and the ending to go karaoke   which was the only time i actually cracked a chuckle  you'd think with three writers we'd have something cohesive and coherent  but instead of a marvel superhero story  we got a disney evil vs good with dragons thrown into the mix  it's as if they tried too hard to create the asian version of black panther it's a shame  because the directing and cinematography were spot on  and great s/vfx   although a little overboard with the cgi i e  dragons  the martial arts choreography was outstanding (although again  overboard after the awesome bus scene)  and the casting and performances were excellent  especially leung  who pretty much carried the film on his shoulders  it's a 7/10 from me ,Positive
45,action great (except cacophonous dragon fight)  acting decent  visuals good  story predictable   the whole this is fine  but i have a more pressing matter to address here  i have yet to watch an mcu movie and felt like i got enough wong  more wong  always more wong ,Positive
46,shang chi (simu liu) discovers that his all powerful and millennium old father is about to launch an attack against the magical village where shang chi's mother was born in the likely mistaken belief that his wife is not dead but is rather being held captive (there is more to the plot than one sentence can sum up but what does it matter    the story is just scaffolding for the special effects)  much fighting ensues but fortunately everyone eventually learns how to 'get along' when faced with a real threat  you have seen it all before: physics defying martial arts  monsters who look like the recently swallowed strings of led christmas lights  conflicted heroes with wise cracking 'comic relief' sidekicks (an awful aquafina and an even more awful ben kingsley)  giant melees featuring a variety of glowing weapons (but no blood)  hyper kinetic and hyper implausible car/motorcycle chases  and a lot of clichéd wisecracks  tough guy dialogue  poseur slo mo  and heroic vogueing (we're treated to the venerable three point power landing/slide a number of times)  the only novel thing the film has to offer is the excellent rendering of mythological beasts from chinese culture; otherwise  it's an overly long (132 minutes  which is 120 minutes too much aquafina)  derivative  repetitive  and ultimately boring entry in the bloated  jejune micky mouse marvel superhero franchise ,Positive
47,shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is the latest marvel film and stars awkarfina and michelle yeoh  a young man must track down the ten rings organisation who were responsible for his mother's death  will he be able to stop them? and his father who is working for the 10 rings?the visuals are very good the score is great and the acting is good too  parts of it reminded me of mulan for some strange reason  the language switches from madarian to english in parts but don't worry there is subtitles overall i enjoyed it  also stars ben kingsley (with a liverpool accent) and surprise cameos from mark ruffalo and brie larson ,Positive
48,shang chi and the legend of the ten rings stars simu liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as tony leung and michelle yeoh in this latest installment to the marvel cinematic universe  liu's shang chi must come to his own as the son of the legendary mandarin (leung)  the owner of the ten rings i like this film's style most of all  director destin daniel cretton mixes chinese wuxia settings and aesthetics with hong kong wire kung fu inspired action set pieces  while still keeping it feeling like a marvel film  there's a surprising amount of callbacks and nods to the larger marvel universe  pleasing dedicated fans  but the film is still able to stand on its own feet and introduce us to its hero kudos also to the whole filming for these action scenes  very little shaky cam or jump cuts  especially for the hand to hand scenes  exactly as it should be  i'd dare to say that this film has some of  if not the best action set pieces in all of mcu one of the most thrilling and visually spectacular end battles as well  come to think of it furthermore  the acting is solid  especially from liu  leung and awkwafina  who plays shang chi's american friend  meng'er zhang as xialing  shang chi's younger sister  was perhaps my only real gripe with the film  i could have used either a bit more edge to her or alternatively a lot less  now she seemed to flipflop between relatable and aggravating all in all  not the best marvel movie by any means  but that's a really high bar to clear  i can simply say that based on this  i'm very optimistic about mcu's continued future ,Positive
49,it was better than the proceeding marvel movie black window  more exceeding the expectations of a marvel movie  shang chi feels like the marvel movie experience is starting to get back to the normal of the theme ride martian scorsese believes they are (i can't disagree  just note that's what i want)in comparison shang chi is a lower level character  i am a fan of marvel comics but got more of the references to the marvel cinematic universe in this movie than to the direct comic book references  those marvel cinematic universe references were amazing enough to get over the fact that the obvious comic book ones went over my head  i mean this movie's connection to other movies is great fanfare that makes me love it more  so really cool cameos happen that actually move the story along i did like what they did with the mandarin here but do feel they copied and paste a lot of things into the story of shang chi to make a complete movie for a lower level character  from the little i know of the character he more fits into those netflix's shows they did a few years back but change him enough to justify a blockbuster they did succeed in making shang chi's background more fuller  the relationship between him and his father and sister was beautiful  complex and more importantly  never bored me and of course awkafina as the comedy relief and best friend to shang chi was strategic gold  the story for the background was not that full  it's really a character driven movie for without the amazing performances from a group of actors who know their stuff this story would fall short note  i loved the fact that michelle yeoh was in this movie and that gives it a lot  but she's done way better in less effective films (but she most likely got a huge paycheck from disney just to wave her hands around) the special effects were good in this flick  i was impress with what was used to make the final conflict and i was convince that the dude from kim's convenience was a master of kung fuits a good movie but it did not live up to my high expectations of it  it gave me a lot of cool things but really did not give me anything i did not see before  in movies that did it better  but if it's about anything i did spend the rest of the day pretending i knew kung fu ,Positive
50,a san francisco valet finds his past catching up with him in spectacular fashion this is an entertaining superhero adventure story with an asian martial arts theme and a number of entertaining scenes like many introductions to superhero characters there is a bit of backstory to go through and this film does it with flashback sequences in a similar way to 'black panther'  these are mixed with the action  humour and unfolding narrative of the present day plot  additionally there is some important exposition added relating to the marvel multiverse  personally i think everything depicted could have been done in more than one movie  and not so rushed  but that's just a personal preference  what is presented is not complicated in anyway  but very simplified  presumably so that it can be established quickly and the likes of shang chi and katy can share screens with other mcu characters as soon as possible the tone and general feel of the movie also reminds me of the approach taken with 'black panther'  particularly when it focusses on a location that  like wakanda  mixes the sights and sounds of regional culture with the sci fi fantasy  it has obviously been written carefully so that it displays imagery associated with far eastern culture like martial arts  traditional costuming  rural settings  that is marketable to a western audience  but at the same time it avoids other commonly associated negative stereotyping like exaggerated accents  sorcery  yellow peril  bad driving  and (thankfully) gong sounds  much of this is drenched with a liberal amount of fast talking contemporary american humour there are a number of highly enjoyable scenes such as the fight sequence on the bus  the various comedy moments  virtually everything that comes out of ben kingsley's mouth  and all the flashback scenes  the final dinner table scene is probably my favourite visually as you can imagine it is beautiful and full of top drawer cinematography  editing  and technology driven effects  for me though the spectacle goes over the top  particularly in the final action sequence most actors are solid such as simu liu  tony leung  meng'er zhang  michelle yeoh  fala chen  and benedict wong  the standout performances for me easily are nora lum and ben kingsley who have buckets of charisma and the advantage of all the best lines overall there is little to criticise  it just feels like what martin scorsese described perfectly in 2019 as a theme park rather than cinema ,Positive
51,6/10   i seem to be the only one to not be marveling at the latest marvel studios offering  but while this movie is technically sound (visual effects  stunt work  sound  cinematography  you name it)  i found it to be mostly a rehash of things i've seen before (maybe i'm just getting tired of all these superhero movies),Positive
52,glad to see a marvel story that is not a continuation or a reboot  shang chi is a lesser known marvel character  it does reference that it is in the marvel universe  but unlike spider man: far from home shang chi stands on it's own has a story the actors all perform well  everybody plays off each other perfectly  the scenery is so visual  it becomes it's own character  fight scenes are so intense and inventive  if you think it's another superhero origin story  well it is but at the same time it's not  i hope we see more new marvel films in the future ,Positive
53,"this film start with a mother telling a story to her son  and the introduction of the main character ""shang chi"" scene! as turnout  this film is about shang chi need to defeat the so called soul sucker creature to save the world! entire film full of quite intense  and dope action scene! such as  martial art fighting  car chase  car crash  fighting with magic  shooting  explosion  chopping  electrocution  shooting with arrow  flying with dragon  and things broken! make the film quite watchable! at the end  shang chi killed the soul sucker  and save the world! still have two post credit scene! first one  wong finding shang chi to meet with the avengers! second one  sister of shang chi ""xialing"" leading the ten rings organization! that's it! a quite entertain film!",Positive
54,eluding his difficult past  a young man from china has been content playing it safe in san francisco for the past several years even though he lacks a true sense of self  but when drastic circumstances draw him back to his conspicuous origins  he has no choice but to face his demons head on  continuing to expand its cultural horizon the mcu's first asian centric movie has unique choreography  a dazzling visual scheme  splendid hand to hand combat  and of course the expected teases going forward  but some of the more elaborate action set pieces lack needed tension  much of the exposition and backstory isn't very engaging  and up until the third act many of the emotional aspects of the narrative aren't as rich or compelling as they could be  some of the humor is strained  but it's efficiently cast and provides enough to be a distinctive entry into the marvel world  **½,Positive
55,car valet (liu) and his friend are attacked by warriors working for his father who is a 1 000 year old owner of the 10 rings which gives him phenomenal powers  he and his sister are eventually captured by their father who reveals what his strange intentions are and how they fit in wonderful action packed fantasy adventure is brilliantly bought to life by a great cast and some great action sequences including some staggeringly beautiful fantasy scenes  extraordinary how this almost child like fantasy film can so successfully bridge a chase scene across modern day san francisco with battles with dragons whilst maintaining a goodly degree of drama snd humour  huge fun ,Positive
56,"i saw ""shang_chi and the legend of the ten rings""  starring simu liu taken_tv  kung fu cops; awkwafina jumanji:the next level  ocean's eight; tony chiu_wai leung the grandmaster  hard boiled and michelle yeoh star trek:discovery_tv  mechanic:resurrection this is the first asian marvel super hero movie that is based on a minor not as well known character  i grew up loving 'the master of kung fu' because of the martial arts aspect and still have the original comic books  fyi: shang_chi was originally based visually on bruce lee  paul gulacy one of the artist at the time even drew shang_chi to look like bruce lee  they also made changes mainly because of political correctness to his origin story  originally  shang_chi was the son of fu manchu  a racially insensitive character  but now  it has been changed to be the son of the mandarin  an old iron man villain  in the comics  the mandarin had 10 rings on his fingers but here it has been changed to rings on his forearms  these rings shoot energy force bolts and tony also calls his evil organization  'the ten rings'  simu plays shang_chi and tony is the mandarin  in this origin story  you learn what caused their estrangement and why tony is wanting so badly to reconnect  awkwafina plays simu's best friend that tags along on simu's adventures with glimpses into his past & present life and lots of fantastic martial arts and michelle play's simu's aunt  if you like the eagles  you'll probably enjoy the connection to 'hotel california'  there are several cameos  including a couple of avengers  as the end credits start  there is a scene and another one at the very end so don't leave too early it's rated ""pg 13"" for action  violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 12 minutes i really enjoyed this movie and would buy it on blu_ray ",Positive
57,"      haven't we heard all of this before? china is infamous for intellectual property theft  with ten rings being a sterling example of such nefarious cultural shoplifting  seldom credited with any originality beyond propagating germs of mass destruction  it would surprise no one if this outlaw band of grifters opened up a fast food restaurant chain tomorrow selling warm dogs and ""chinese fries"" under some silver arches  allegedly respectful of elder tradition  those on the sinus front have yet to realize that all that glitters is not gold  as ms  stein famously observed  ""a bus is a bus is a bus  no matter how you slice it """,Positive
58,this is a diverting and fun film that has some eye popping fights  some fairly funny comedic bits and a tropey story that is just different enough to keep your attention  in other words  it's a marvel studio *product*  professional and engaging but nothing more than cinematic big mac ,Positive
59,marvel gets mystical in this mashup of the plucky  familiar mcu character and the more stoic  legend heavy air of wuxia films  it's a fresh mix  effectively breaking the gravity of its more serious moments with a well timed jape while lending credence and lore to a lesser known corner of the comic kingdom  but these crossover moments sometimes test their limits  i could see more grounded viewers being turned off by the dragons and soul sucking demons (far cry from the feasible reality of the first iron man  that) while serious fans of chinese fantasy are bucked by the constant injection of loose wit and slappy one liners when it's rolling  shang chi does manage to toe that line and deliver something appropriately new and versatile  a good reflection of both worlds  it benefits from a tight pair of central performances (simu liu and awkwafina as a team of underachieving twenty somethings) and several big  powerful action sets (the articulated bus fight might be one of the best combat scenes marvel's ever put out) while tying in a dangling thread or two from earlier films to provide a sense of greater connection  on several occasions  however  it's guilty of being too self indulgent and losing the narrative  it's great to see ben kingsley again  adding nuance to his part in iron man 3  but his scenes are the main offender here; excessive and distracting and way too cute the action is strong  the dialogue (mostly) works  the scenery looks great  but in the big picture  shang chi feels small scale and disposable  non completionists won't miss anything crucial if they choose to skip it ,Positive
60,bringing martial arts into this franchise is well     a breath of fresh air from marvel  showcasing a series of excellent action sequences  there are some very intelligent minds be hide this origin story fantasy sci fi feature  shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is one of the best mcu films  pro tip  at some point in your lives seek this gem out ! this is going to be very solid uhd hdr blu ray and the 3d is very impressive albeit some minor cross talk but forgivable as the are some very intricate set pieces for the left and right eye to navigate via the post conversion 3d  very well done over all the visuals were absolutely stunning  comedic relief was always on point  fight sequences were sleek yet powerful  the story arch is well paced and unfolds gradually so one can get emotionally involved with the films characters   the acting is superb on all fronts from the films talented ensemble   the directing and pacing is spot on shang chi and the legend of the tens rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and one of my favorite entries as a whole  you'll leave the theater satisfied ,Positive
61,if you only ever watched one movie at the cinema in your entire span of days  make it this phenomenal sight  sound and super spectacular sensory sensation  smashes everything out of the park! and some ,Positive
62,honestly  i had no idea this movie was going to be so marvelous! well  marvelous  but you get the idea      i can't even discuss about the cinematography!! if you've watched it  you know that the last 30 minutes at least  are simply magical! i just loved it  the portrayal of the comic story was really great  coming from a huge marvel comic fan! also  ben the legend kingsley!!!! easily a 10/10  i can't wait for more material from this characters!ps  the cameos in the end!,Positive
63,shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is yet another movie inspired by the marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now  while the movie follows the usual stereotypes  it manages to stand out with its stunning special effects and locations the movie revolves around shaun  a chinese immigrant living in the united states of america who is working as a valet with his quirky friend and soulmate katy  one day  they get attacked by a group of assassins on a bus and only just manage to survive  shaun immediately understands that the attack must be related to his influential estranged father  along with katy  he decides to team up with his tough estranged sister xialing to find out what's going on this film convinces on multiple levels  first of all  the acting performances are quite quirky and convincing  especially the ladies steal the show  awkwafina delivers the goods as curious  dynamic and funny woman that anyone would like to have as a friend  zhang meng'er on the other side represents a much darker character shaped by dramatic events from the past who is much more difficult to approach with her tough  relentless and independent personality the expensive special effects certainly deliver the goods as well  the scenes in a fantasy world  in ancient china and in contemporary san francisco are all equally stunning to watch  the fantastic creatures such as dragons look impressive on the big screen the story might be predictable but is nevertheless entertaining from start to finish thanks to steady pace and inspired execution  you will truly care about the fates of the different characters as you are watching this film however  this film isn't without its occasional flaws  first of all  lead actor simu liu simply doesn't have the charisma of the other actresses and actors involved  casting him was a bold choice but it didn't fully pay off in my opinion up next  the movie desperately tries to connect to other characters in the marvel universe  the appearance of trevor slattery played by ben kingsley is completely random as it only seems to be a pretext to offer some misplaced comic relief  the mid credit scene starts in an amusing fashion but suddenly involving bruce banner and carol danvers only seems like a weak attempt to develop a hype for potential sequels  the same goes for yet another scene after the credits that evokes more questions rather than concluding the film appropriately at the end of the day  shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is an entertaining fantasy action film of the marvel universe that should appeal to faithful and occasional fans alike  it's one of the better films in the franchise but perhaps marvel should focus on quality over quantity instead of becoming a monstrous capitalistic machine that is scarier than any gigantic dragon shown in the film ,Positive
64,funny yet serious storyline  a nice balance between reality and fantasy  one of the top tier marvel movies   it takes the typical mcu elements and improves on them by adding actual martial arts ,Positive
65,"shang chi and the legend of the ten rings: the origin story of shang chi  his father xu wenwu found the ten rings of power 1 000 years ago and trough history has been a conqueror and robber baron  in 1996 he found ta lo a mystical village  but is beaten by it's guardian  ying li  they fall in love and have two children  shang li and his sister xiang  tragedy strikes and shang chi is raised to be an assassin  his sister trains in secret  the story is about xu wanting his children to join with him in a strange quest but things don't go smoothly  modern style gin battles and those involving mystical weapons abound  well choreographed as are the martial arts sequnces  one great fight aboard a runaway san francisco bus on those hills  we also have a cthuluesque devourer of souls with it's flying minions who battle a chinese flying dragon (he's the good guy)  there's also a faceless ""winged wombat"" and other mythological beasts  a great adventure  directed and co written by destin daniel cretton  8/10 ",Positive
66,the action choreography is just awful  they almost look like they are dancing and not fight for pretty much all of the fight scenes; and the fight scenes are the main reason to watch the f#$king movie!,Negative
67,charming and incredibly fun  shang chi may not be the best marvel has had to offer  but it is one of their better films in some time  my main problems with the film lie in the films storyline  which to be honest  is really good  but incredibly all over the place editing wise and there is just so much of it that it feels like two movies could have been made out of it  i love that we get a more in depth look at our characters  their flaws  their regrets  the tragedy in their lives  but the editing makes it feel rather out of place at times  and takes away from the impact the film could have had and its heart  that being said  the film still manages to be very enjoyable throughout  the action scenes are absolutely incredible  the look of the film incredibly well developed  something very fresh and original for marvel studios  and the cast are all a joy to watch  especially simu liu and aquafina in the lead and supporting roles  i was skeptical of aquafina being in a marvel movie for sure  but she really helped the film as a whole  and honestly i would love to see more of her character in future marvel projects  the film is entertaining  despite the pacing of the film being a bit all over the place at times  it has some brilliant  elaborate special effects that you will be gawking at on the screen  and plenty of surprises that will be bound to make you smile  in the end  shang chi was a fun time for a marvel movie  something most comic book flicks have forgotten about recently  and i'm excited what this character has to offer in future films my rating: 8 6/10 ,Positive
68,as someone that really enjoys the mcu  i'm starting to wonder if covid may have killed it  black widow was a meh experience and now shang chi feels like more of that rote  by the numbers repetitiveness  yes  they add a lot of asian elements here to bring in other groups and try and lessen the white dominance of this franchise and i appreciate that but this movie felt like it was rushing through the plot to get to the next fantastical element and in so doing really robbed those moments of any lingering significance  not to mention  the marvel formula felt so very pronounced  it's so obvious what's going to happen in this movie from the jump and that's disappointing that aside  i'm a moderate fan of older marvel comics and    these aren't the ten rings! normally i don't mind when the mcu makes little adjustments to the source material  comics are weird and a lot of that stuff wouldn't translate well to film  i get that but so far they've had two big  fat whiffs on anything mandarin related  looking at you iron man 3  these things are just super generic bands with pretty underwhelming powers which is so different from the 10 rings in the comics that all do something different!nerd rage aside  this just felt average to me  i'll probably check it out at some point again but i'm not feeling any sort of draw to revisit it soon  it's a touch more disappointing as i work through the disney+ marvel shows which all feel more engaging and more creative than this  come on  mouse  get it together and put some of this tv magic back on the big screen!,Positive
69,shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is an incredible mcu origin story that's epic  emotional and extremely thrilling whilst also connecting to the greater universe in fun and satisfying ways  it's definitely the best thing in phase 4 so far even if it's third act has some of the usual mcu problems simu liu gives an incredible and extremely charismatic lead performance whilst also having superb chemistry with awkwafina  who is also incredible  michelle yeoh and meng'er zhang are both great and tony leung is amazing as one of the better villains in the mcu with plenty of backstory and depth destin daniel cretton's direction is excellent  it's extremely well filmed and stylish with some of the best action sequences in the franchise  the fight choreography is extremely impressive and the cg is mostly strong  it's well paced and both the soundtrack and the music by joel p  west are both fantastic ,Positive
70,having fighters who can act there  as really a movie that asian americans can be proud of  adding humor  adventure  depth  and humanity all rolled up on in oneshaun who's chinese name is shan chi and his best friend  katy work as park valets  not knowing that their lives will take on more meaning besides dead end jobs shaun tries to not have his past be in public even with his best friend there  as he is not proud of it and tries to move on and that after a bus incident that katy does not know shaun is the title character and he reveals his past via note from his estranged sister  or is it from her  his sister  xu who runs a fighting and nightclub mixed in one in china as their childhoods went in different directions due to their father favoring shaun over his sister there  is part of it  but the three main character realize that something bigger than they are as the ten rings reveal their destiny not just shaun's not just you will see how shaun and xu's mother died but also that why his own father favored him and in the end was very disappointed in him in not keeping a promise there  leading to shaun trying to eschew his past simu liu makes a handsome action star who can also act  awkwafina brings comic relief and finds out that she has something much more to offersupport by michelle yeoh and tony leung as shaun and xu's father and the main antagonist of the film  the latter has his own reasons despite being the villain but with depth and humanity a bit  you do not want to dislike him ,Positive
71,"likesgreat pacing:
shang chi has a lot of things built into the tale as it tries to make an origin story fit so far into the movie series  with all the information  there might be worry of the pace being off  but surprisingly it is done super well  never really dragging  but not moving a blinding pace (mostly)  shang chi's combination tales keeps things moving but not flying over the important elements to connect with characters  the cast gets ample time to give us their backstories  piece together all the cluse of this dynamic drama puzzle  and not sacrifice on the action to come character development:
the trailers may have you thinking this is a modern martial arts film  and in a sense they would be right  however  the movie takes it one step further and goes beyond the punches to instead give the characters some soul and layers compared to the legendary films of the past  shang's life is complicated and torn between light and dark  his sister as well experiencing the drama in her own manner that parallels the main protagonist  even the antagonist has layers far beyond what we normally get from the marvel group  and i loved how well their lines mixed together to make this melodramatic family story fit naturally into the marvel universe the surprise cameo:
can't say much without spoiling  but if you are like me  then you will not be disappointed who shows up in the film  several questions are answered with this character's return and with it many laughs to be had in the manner very familiar to marvel fans  the inclusion of this character also holds an important (albeit stretch) plot element to give a little more meaning behind it  and i loved the choices they made to include him in the big picture the cultural influence:
like black panther and the african culture  shang chi integrates so much of the cultural values of the asian provinces into this movie  the costumes are stunning takes on the traditional attire  bringing the past to light while also sewing in some modern styles to jazz up the outfits  concepts of family honor  the customs to practicing marshal arts  and the honoring of family are well integrated into the story and help give the predictable tale some extra kung fu kick  the architecture of most of the setting breathes new life to the typical cityscapes that have been made famous in marvel  and the legends of the ten rings scream of the asian mythology that is seeped int heir history  i loved how well these things were merged into a marvel tale  and though again a little predictable and flaunting  really elevated the origin story to stand out from so many others the cgi
finally disney has invested in making their movies show off what the studio can do  shan chi and the bunch have plenty of amazing things to overuse the computer effects that the modern era loves  special effects for the action scenes has more realism to it then black widow executed  the creatures you will see have a lot more polish and fluidity to their movements  and the special effects involving the ten rings are fluid and holding depth that i felt has been missing in some recent marvel projects the acting:
a great part played by all members on this film  extras included  shang chi's cast shows that acting is not dead and characters can be utilized well  simu liu as the lead was fantastic  and his campaign for being in this movie could not have ended up with better results  he holds much of the prodigal martial artist  disciplined and focused to be an avid fighter capable of crushing his enemies with his style  however  he also has that troubled layer in the past to watch that helped spread his emotional spectrum  awkwafina is still the same cooky role she always plays  but this time gets a little more balance and heroism compared to the other characters she has heralded as in the past  i loved how well she was used in this film  and how great she complemented simu in this role  leung brings a lot of pizazz to the character  once again giving us an antagonist with so much more than the scowl and fist  and i felt was a perfect casting to play the opponent of shang chi  so many other great actors and actresses in this film  but due to time restrictions i have to move on  but trust me they did well in their performances the comedy:
awkwafina is often used too much for making us laugh  and disney has struggled with forcing a lot of comedy to make it kid friendly  however  shang chi has taken some steps back into discipline and used the comedy well to break up the ice  dialogue goes a long way to breaking in the laughs  with well timed jokes and gags being the solid punch to the gut with comedy  there are several ridiculous inclusions in this film that at first seem out of place  but then roll back in to be an extravagant joke that had great set up  and the throw in references that come with it and you get a shining beacon of awesomeness that comes with this movie  it's all done so well and i was very happy with the results the action:
my bread and butter for most of the marvel movies  shang chi delivered very well on this film's action exposé  the art of choreographed battles brings another homage to asian culture  and with it fantastic fights that had more bite and impressive skill use then half of the marvel cinema  it's exciting  it's dynamic  and most of the fights have a different feel to them than what you might expect  used well in the story  there is purpose behind the inclusion of the battles and each one has a different meaning and stakes behind it than simply punching and kicking  even more so  the strategies behind them and what is required to win  accomplishes a level of storytelling that has been lost in the modern era  so well done on that too a bit more adult:
the movie is definitely showing marvel's modernization into the 21st century  and takes a risk of making this film darker and more adult than other installments  cursing is definitely increased in this one  with plenty of swear words filling the dialogue  but not to the point of being overdone  no f bombs  but some of the language has got a little more bite  so caution  in addition  the tone of the tale is darker  and the sunshine and rainbows of thor  captain america  and guardians is left in the dust for a grittier tale  which again is a plus some of the political moments:
while nowhere as bad as 75% of movies today  shang chi does sometimes get a bit preachy with the agenda politics of the film  taking time out to rub it in our faces with an obvious line stating  ""look what i had to do "" was a bit of showboating that i could have done without  yet even this dislike is marginal  given it's very little occurring  has some nice moments that build off of it  and sometimes has a fun lesson or joke built in a little more action:the action in this movie is great  and i loved how much of it flowed and accomplished what i was expecting of the film  and things i was not expecting  yet there were times where a moment of fighting felt a little forced  namely the chase scenes with vehicles that seemed like an afterthought  however  the fights at the end needed some more time for me  and perhaps a little more bouncing between the battles occurring at the same time  star wars has done this successfully in the past  showing all manners of battling and giving you a big scope of the battle  shang chi has done this better than several of the marvel films  but still had some room to give us more looks at the other characters kicking butt  the battle is lengthy enough  i'll agree to that  but a little more showing off of the other warriors would have rounded this fight to perfection for me the verdict:shang chi finally made me feel like we were back into the realm of marvel i fell in love with years ago  a cultural building world with both origin and story continuation  this hero's quest had all the makings of a fun  exciting and swift adventure we were expecting  buried beneath the amazing fights and special effects  was a deeper movie than i had expected  using their characters well and integrating them to serve a purpose  balanced comedy with a cultural inclusion and politics did not steal away from the main theme of the movie  and giving it that adult touch was a plus in my book  though again caution with your little ones watching it  as for limitations  i agree there is predictability and familiarity with the movie  but the fresh twist and balance helps rejuvenate the formula and add minimize the impact of the limitations for me  though i will say a little better wider scope battle is still needed by them  overall  my scores for this film are:action/adventure/fantasy: 9 0 9 5
movie overall: 8 5 9 0 ",Positive
72,my rating : 8/10extremely well made  i thoroughly enjoyed 'shang chi and the legend of the ten rings' and without hesitation would recommend it to anyone who wants to watch a funny  engaging martial arts inspired superhero movie loved the chemistry between all actors and the casting is very good!cute superhero action movie with some creative fun stuff!,Positive
73,"shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is the most mystical and beautiful movie in history! the music  the special effects and the acting all take you to another world  the film leaves you wanting a morris of your own the storyline follows a young man named shang chi (simu liu)  his father is a one thousand year old man and conqueror nicknamed the mandarin (tony leung chiu wai)  who has only ever used the infamous and all powerful ten rings for evil  when the mandarin is set to unleash infinite evil on the universe  shang chi has to stop his father this movie is a cinematic experience  the fighting and choreography are out of this world  the long slow motion shots make the audience feel as if they are in a video game  simu steals the show; every fight scene is flawless with his fluid movements and it proves just how hard he worked on his character for this film  every audience falls in love with shang chi; he's funny  with perfect comedic timing and he knows the balance between peace and violence  he encapsulates what the majority of young adults feel   like not being able to find their place in the world  the movie makes fans feel as if they've known shang for years  it has wonderful flashbacks  which give the audience glimpses of his past  his pain and how his fears have shaped who he is  the film gives a wonderful all around scope of this character that feels like a friend we've known all our life  it makes fans excited to see shang chi again  shang and his sister xu xialing are an iconic duo  they're both powerful and  while there's some tension due to their past  they put everything aside and let love shine through  xialing is a role model  officially joining the marvel cinematic universe's most powerful women  shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is perfect for aapi (asian americans and pacific islanders) representation in cinema  it represents chinese culture powerfully  shows what it's like to be an asian american in modern day usa  not to mention that simu is marvel studios' first asian american superhero  simu and shang chi are writing history while also inspiring children and fans all around the world  the film delivers on all grounds; the cameos are shocking and leave you on the edge of your seat  trying not to shout during the two post credits scenes prove to be a challenge  by the end of the movie  i wanted to sing the song ""hotel california"" at the top of my lungs this film reminds you to search for who you are and let your past guide you to who you want to be  ever since his mother died  shang has been trained by his father to use violence  when he arrives at his mother's village  he learns how to find peace within himself and the world around him  he learns to trust himself and to use the rings for good i give shang chi and the legend of the ten rings 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18 plus adults  it is available only in theaters september 3  2021  by heather s   kids first!",Positive
74,thought i was feeling some marvel fatigue after wandavision (which started strong but ended on a bit of a whimper) and black widow (which wasn't terrible  but two months later i can't remember anything about it except how florence pugh was cool in it)  but this one has rejuvenated some of my enthusiasm for the unstoppably huge mcu there's a satisfying origin story here  with a few small appearances from familiar characters that add spice to a host of new characters who are all quite compelling right out of the gate the action's great  and there's also so much of it  i liked how lots of the action felt relatively grounded by mcu standards  with neat stunt work and exciting camerawork making the action pop (it's only the final battle that gets really cgi heavy) the humour's also more consistent than most marvel films  with most of the jokes landing  also cool were all the fantasy elements and creatures  they were all pretty inventive and well executed i will say the one notable flaw is that there's a lot of exposition in the film's second half  but they get around that a little by having great actors like tony leung and michelle yeoh do most of the explaining (and there is a lot to explain  with this being a whole new side of the mcu and all)  so it's not super noticeable ,Positive
75,shang chi is a great movie with some very well made action scenes  it have some funny moments and serious ones  the whole story is about family  friendship  its a classic line story but still pretty interesting to follow (costume design  environnment  revenge story) and the visual effects as always with marvel is pretty great to watch  i recommend it ,Positive
76,"shang chi and the legend of the ten rings (2021)well what a pleasant surprise  very much in the style of black panther  this origin story was really great from start to finish i saw this at the 3d 4dx at the o2 and we were thrown about  blown on  rained on and every other sensation at every turn it was fab u lus!we had some great acting some great humour and plenty of ""magic""  for marvel fans after the lacklustre black widow  the disaster of the winter soldier  two goodens in a row what with snake eyes!the fight scenes we well worked through and the opening bus sequence was very memorable  i don't thing there was anything i didn't like about this movie so i'm giving 10 outta 10 ",Positive
77,shang chi  the master of weaponry based kung fu  is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the ten rings organization the film itself while not perfect was a really good watch and way more enjoyable then black widow ben kingsley was a lot better here then he was in iron man 3 the acting was good the effects were cool i definitely recommend it ,Positive
78,honestly  on all levels this movie excels! the casting is perfect  the world building is creative  beautiful and faithful to its asian roots  the cgi and location shoots are breathtaking  the fighting is the best i've ever seen and even the training ground sequences have an exquisite grace  the action was balanced by heart  i was concerned awkwafina would take the humour to campy lows but she truly showed she has some serious dramatic chops  she was not the comic relief! they gave that honour to the shakespearean stage giant  ben kingsley  our own  homegrown 🇨🇦 simu liu was perfect for the part and his performance was world class  i could go on raving but i'll conclude my feedback by saying that this is in every way as powerful a mcu solo representation of asian culture as black panther was for african culture  i gathered some feedback as i left the theatre  and got ratings of 7 5 (felt it needed more mcu content)  8 (saw many of the things i have just commented on)  i've read the criticism that the storytelling was choppy  but i didn't find it so  for me it was more like chapters in a book  completely working together to create a world of content and design  upon leaving the cinema  i was going to give the movie a 9 (superb) out of 10  but after reflecting on it  i don't know what they could have done to make it better  so  i give this film a 10 (perfect) out of 10  {superhero action adventure},Positive
79,"(spoilers)
down pretty far on the marvel list  the writers and director of shang chi kinda miss the mark  the movie is a snooze fest for the first hour and its tone is all over the place  the end of the movie was visually interesting but honestly borrowed from pacific rim/godzilla  leading up to that the drive in the story is non sensical   the father is being called to by his wife to bring his family together? no  as time passes  this is a weak motivation  the sound on quality was poor from dialog to music   i had to keep upping the volume for dialog and lowering for soundtrack/interlude  humor is stunted and meh  fairly disappointing  especially compared to other marvel movies ",Positive
80,"as a mcu fanatic  i've been trying to get excited about the movies they have released post endgame  but it has been a challenge  that particular film was such a perfect finale for the series that i have struggled with the efforts to get the storyline going again  it doesn't help that they have been so scattered in topics  lacking a single core group to bring them all together  shang chi is another random hero that i only knew vaguely from references in the comics  but i never read any of his books back when i was a collector  i appreciated that this film brought a new style to a mcu movie  the blending of wuxia into a superhero story was a fun choice there were also quite a few great actors in this film including tony leung  ben kingsley  michelle yeoh  and i'd even include awkwafina in that category  i can certainly see how some other people might struggle with awkwafina's schtick  but i find her comedic timing to be great  and i was laughing along the whole time  however  the one major name i left out of the ""great actors"" is simu liu  sadly  i found him a little bland  he was okay with the comedy  but i certainly don't see him stacking up with the legends that have come before in the mcu  heck  benedict wong has only about 5 minutes of screentime in this film  but still made a greater impression on me than simu liu digging into the story of shang chi and the legend of the ten rings  i'd say it's a fine origin story  even if it was highly predictable  this is the kind of movie where you can stay 10 steps ahead of it  and that is unfortunate  i think that's the biggest problem with the entire film  while it's fun and engaging it also feels like a rough carbon copy of things that came before  it's a movie that is emulating a number of wuxia films from the past  but it's not as good as any of them  it's a movie that is following the tropes of a superhero origin story  and once again isn't on the level of the best of the genre  you can't fault their ambition  but their execution was lacking all that negativity is not to say that shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is a bad film  in fact  i enjoyed the entire time in the theater  and was genuinely invested in the story  i thought it handled the links to the mcu well  but without feeling like it had shameless pandering for the fans  or devolving into obscure references only people like myself would understand  the film had some gorgeous visuals  and created its own world in a way that managed to be both unique but still consistent with the style of other mcu movies  there were personal stakes in the film  despite the fact that the ending fell into a giant cgi battle that felt unnecessary  i can't say that shang chi will rise into the upper echelon of my mcu rankings  but it's better than some that came before ",neutral
81,wow!!! spectacular viewing from the mcu!sean (shang chi) lives in san francisco and parks cars for a living with his best friend katy  whom he met when they were 14  he's happy with his life  he enjoys karaoke one day these bad  scary looking guys attack sean and katy on a bus and demand the green pendant sean wears around his neck   oh yeah    sean's real name is shang chi  and his father is the leader of the ten rings terrorist organization  what?!?!?!?!?!?the visuals are incredible  and awkwafina is hilarious!if i say anything else i'll give something away  ,neutral
82,shang chi is marvel's latest blockbuster to grace the movies: and after 2020's non existent marvel slate  it was about bloody time we got something after the world dealt with the sars variant and got our double shots  and now  late 2021 we can finally go back to the movies en masse  though the road to recovery's far from over shang chi is part origin story for a character we've never known before  part cg spectacle interlaced with nice kung fu choreography in between  all in universe expansion for marvel's cinematic ambitions  and it makes you wonder how deeply they thought about paying reverence to everything from bruce lee to the matrix  to dragon ball  the last airbender and kung fu panda marvel is doing its best to escape the confines of iron man's legacy  and this seems like an earnest start for something far removed from the likes of spider man  and so on  also makes you wonder if awkwafina is gonna become a major player outside the shang chi movies alone shang chi is the stuff you've come to expect from marvel studios; it's going big and it won't stop with every subsequent film here onward  though bigger and better seems better fitted for high concept space operas like infinity war and endgame than more earthbound character driven stories shang chi's good fun  and it really succeeds in being that during its runtime ,Positive
83,review by kamal kmarvels new shang chi was a choreographed dance movie disguised as kung fu with slow paced action scenes and subtle but detailed components that pull a story together a satisfying but inappropriately fast paced manner  making the writing seem more lazy and poorly thought out  which for me took away greatly from that satisfaction the main gripe i have with shang chi is how it just so happens that the jade neckaces show the path and time to the hidden forest path just days before another oath opens for them to go find the tao lao although the comedy music  and some of the choreography for the fight scenes were good enough to give this movie a final score of 6 out of 10 score ,Positive
84,love everything about this movie! good origin story  great cast and awesome action scenes  simu  meng'er  awkwafina  and tony definitely nailed the role  i recently watched the movie and it was so awesome  i liked this one a lot more than the black widow one  and i can see why people got so hyped for this movie  and so far i think it has been phenomenal  of course i can't judge the new and upcoming spider man movie  cause we haven't seen it yet  but this film is just raising the bar so high to the point where other films are having a massive disadvantage to such standard story telling  i was blown away after watching it  the story  the fights  the casting  everything was just marvellous!,Positive
85,i have to admit i've been pretty disappointed with every mcu movie since endgame so i was pleasantly surprised by shang chi  which i didn't really have high hopes for (the last marvel martial arts based hero was iron fist  and that was a turd)  this movie was very entertaining even if it had a pretty generic and predictable storyline  and special effects were fairly uneven (amazing 'mcu quality' along with pretty terrible early 2000s cgi)  it's great to add more diversity with an asian superhero but i hope they will make good use of him in future movies and not relegate him to secondary sidekick roles!,Positive
86,it's an entertaining fantasy  action and adventure film  it has beautiful backdrops  settings  and costumes  the martial arts ballet and fighting has excellent choreography  the cinematography was colorful with strong compositions and it flowed well from action scenes to action scenes awkwafina is funny and she provided the needed comedy relief  the story was a little busy for my taste but it still worked  the cgi was good but expected from a marvel/disney film ,neutral
87,"the characters are a bit incoherent and straight up contradict their own characterizations at times  because the plot needs them to do it  there are a bunch of unneeded ""deux ex machina"" or conveniences because the writers trapped themselves into corners for no reason (that's what happens when you get the 2021 ""mortal kombat""  ""ww84"" and ""the expendables"" writers) also  we have awkwafina destroying every type of scene (dramatic; epic; and also the comedic ones) with one of the worst ""acting"" i've ever seen and a same type of joke (""awkward nonsense"") over and over  from start to finish  with a role ridiculously large for a dumb comic relief but    liu is actually pretty good as a lead (and his character is potentially great)  and the ""shang chi world"" is beautiful and it has everything to be super fun to watch in the future   without awkwafine and better writers ",Positive
88,for an mcu movie  i've seen better  and the movie still not on the level like iron man  captain america  thor  black panther  ant man  and even black widow the recent one before this that everybody hate or think it just an alright film but i found it way better than this and it's a perfect movie (in terms of an mcu superhero solo movie)  shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is still an exciting film with a dazzling special and visual effects  incredible action packed  and amazing performance  though the second part/place in the movie didn't work perfectly  and shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is not one of my favorite and probably the least in the franchise and character but overall movie is still great ,Positive
89,"with the end of the infinity saga in the marvel cinematic universe  there is a lot of room for new franchises to fill in the gaps left by the likes of iron man and captain america  however  this means lesser known properties like shang chi and the legend of the ten rings (2021) get their chance to shine  and while lesser known franchises like guardians of the galaxy are now household names  i think it remains to be seen if shang chi can truly develop its own integrated identity within the mcu having somewhat botched the introduction of the mandarin (ben kingsley) in iron man 3 (2013)  shang chi attempts to ret con this by insisting that the ten rings organization is a genuine threat to world peace  however  marvel wants to have its cake and eat it too by including the ""mandarin"" in this film  there are a few other loose connections to the larger mcu in this film  but they are more cameo call outs than anything significant  overall  shang chi is its own story the fact that a good portion of this film's climax takes place in a mythical hidden kingdom made it feel disconnected from the mcu as a whole  sure  other franchises within the mcu have their origin stories  still  i felt they made it clear how they contributed to the ""whole"" of the larger arc by either introducing characters or concepts in prior mcu movies  shang chi excels in its action and choreography but feels generic in the grand scheme of things as a standalone film  i'd almost wager that its sequel will be much more interesting and that those not already committed to the mcu can probably give this one a pass a standalone ret con of previous mcu mistakes  i give shang chi and the legend of the ten rings 3 0 stars out of 5 ",Positive
90,"the new marvel super hero film  shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is the kind of film that deserves to be seen on the big screen and writer/director destin daniel cretton (just mercy) has crafted a film that earns that statement based on the marvel comic book character (of course)  shang chi tells the tale of   well   shang chi a financially struggling   but happy   valet in san francisco who has a family secret writer/director cretton has crafted a whimsical  mythological  mystical and action packed film that settles in at the top end of the marvel cinematic universe family of films at the center  newcomer simu liu (kim's convenience) more than holds his own as the newest super hero in the mcu  he is grounded  centered and more sure than unsure as he discovers his abilities and his family's secrets  he is a worthy addition to this world of superheroes joining him is the remarkable awkwafina (crazy  rich asians) as his best friend  sidekick who handles the drama comedy and action with aplomb  this film makes some smart choices with this character and awkwafina shines the rest of the cast/characters are equally as strong from tony chi wai leung (as shang chi's father) to meng'er zhang (as shang chi's sister) and good ol' michelle yeoh (as shang chi's aunt) bring strong characters to life  they all shine this film also brings back a character from a previous mcu film that somewhat redeems the poorly conceived character from his earlier appearance  i won't spoil it by saying who it is  but i liked what the mcu did with this character but  this being a marvel movie  all of these performances anchor a bigger picture that is filled with action  action and more action   and something else  something mystical here is where director cretton really shines  the action scenes are interestingly staged and choreographed well  the first fight (the bus fight that is shown in the trailer) and a fight on scaffolding both particularly work well this film does delve into the mystical in the last 1/3 and in cretton's hands  this ends up working well instead of being comical or inane  i bought what was going on and was rooting for our heroes to defeat the undefeatable  fantastical creatures to be honest  the ""final battle"" didn't really live up to the rest of the film so that brings this film down a notch  but this movie did what it needed it to do  it opened up a whole new area of the marvel cinematic universe   in both character and locations   and i am anxious to see where they go from here try to see shang chi on the big screen  the visuals are worth it letter grade a  (the finale needed to be better)8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the bank(ofmarquis)",Positive
91,shang chi and the legend of the ten rings tells the story of shaun/shang chi(simu liu)  shang chi is an expert of kung fu  he is forced to deal with his past  when he's pursued by the ten rings organization shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is a mind blowing film  the marvel cinematic universe strikes gold yet again & can do no wrong! director destin daniel cretton has given us one of the marvel cinematic universe's best origin stories  the action set pieces are the highlight of the movie  it's awesome to finally see the kung fu fighting style  utilized in the marvel cinematic universe  the visual effects are awe inspiring  simu liu is spectacular as shaun/shang chi  liu easily balances the action  dramatic scenes & the marvel cinematic universe's trademark humor  can't wait to see more of him in the future  awkwafina is hysterical as katy  tony chiu wai leung is outstanding as xu wenwu  meng'er zhang is fantastic as xialing  fala chen is brilliant as li  michelle yeoh is excellent as ying nan  florian munteanu is superb as razor fist  the supporting cast is amazing  shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is a must watch for marvel cinematic universe fans & superhero film buffs  watch it on the biggest screen possible  preferably imax  can't wait for eternals(2021)!,Positive
92,the mix is great for me   the artistic quality of the fighting  the marvel go to formula and a little awkwafina mixed in for kicks  10 rings  dragons and family drama   ,Positive
93,watched shang chi and the legend of the ten rings with simu liu(kim's convenience) as xu shang chi/shaun awkwafina(crazy rich asians) as katy  meng'er zhang(the street dawn) as xu xialing michelle yeoh(crouching tiger hidden dragon) as ying nan  florian munteanu(creed ii) as razor fist  fala chen(the informer) as ying li benedict wong(avengers:endgame) as wong and tony leung(in the mood for love) as wenwu/the mandarin the film is great if any of you are a fan of martial arts you are going to enjoy this also really dives into the spirituality of eastern mythos of the mcu while still have ties to the mcu wenwu was responsible for the ten rings in the iron man films going back to the very beginning also love the father dynamic between shang and the mandarin great performances from liu and leung as well also awkwafina continues to be on a role since breaking out in crazy rich asians and also starring in similar film in raya and the last dragon this is a game changer also if your a fan forbidden kingdom your are going love this  this is game changer much like doctor strange in 2016  im also grateful its helping cinema return to form but im not against hybrid releases though they help in certain areas also they both can co exist score by joel p  west(just mercy)  cinematography by william pope(alita:battle angel) and direction by destin daniel cretton(short term 12) a game changer also its more martial arts than superhero 9/10 ,Positive
94,i think its a kungfu movie in good taste  and most of the typical 'marvel' humor wasn't that noticable  it was a little sappy from time to time  but overall very tolerable 7/10: yes ok good ,neutral
95,"i had low expectations for this movie  first off  the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal  it's so god damn beautifully well done  the storyline is extremely brilliant where it explores how this man found the ten rings that gifted him with unlimited power and immortality that kept him alive for thousands of years  would create an organization known as the ten rings who would later be responsible for the kidnapping of tony stark in afghanistan  aldrich killian's madness after their job  the two ride on a bus  but only to encounter the ten rings and a guy with a ""freakin' machete""  i have to say  though  this scene's choreography was god damn great  and the music made it even better  after the attack  katy begins to question shang's motives  shang explains the backstory of how he came to be  and that he needed to go visit his long lost sister  they take the airplane to china  the two arrive in this underground fighting club that was broadcasted to the dark web only to encounter a guy who told him to sign to fight  even though shang didn't know what he was signing up for  we get to see a cameo of the abomination fighting wong  i have to say that the cgi was better on him in every level  i am quite glad that the writers are starting to acknowledge the incredible hulk  shang is up to fight an unknown opponent  and it is revealed that it is his sister  shang tries to talk to her that he doesn't want to fight which basically led to him getting his *** kicked  (( have to put asterisks so that imdb won't delete this review  so don't be surprised  ))after the fight  shang tells his sister  xialing about the ten rings situation  they soon realize that the ten rings attack the club which leads us to another action scene  unrelated  but i have noticed that people have been complaining that mcu heroes don't kill  i'm pretty sure that they did kill since the beginning where iron man used his mark i to light his victims on fire  blowing up multiple people  fatal blasts  etc  the death dealer steals xialing's pendant  capturing the three of them to the ten rings headquarters to reunite with their father waiting for them  back at the headquarters  wenwu explains how there is still hope to save their mother by finding ta lo to save ying  wenwu uses the two pendants to place them on the dragon's eyes generating a map made of water showing them the secret passage through the bamboo maze  and the perfect time where it can be granted  wenwu tells them that if the people of ta lo won't comply  he will burn down the village with no mercy  shang is against this  wenwu throws them in the catacombs  the three hear some weird noises only to encounter trevor who was the fake mandarin in iron man 3! if you didn't know  there was a short that explains slattery's experience in jail  in the end  he is captured by the ten rings  morris comes out of the corner  telling trevor the true path xialing discovers that there are escape routes  the team hijacks razor's car which leads us to another fight sequence  they soon approach the bamboo forest maze  katy is assisted where to turn by morris and slattery  finally  they enter a waterfall  arriving at the ta lo village  guang bo tells the group to turn back  ying nan delays that order  meeting her niece and nephew  although  i did realize this was michelle yeoh who portrayed philippa georgiou in star trek: discovery  i do need to catch up as i lost interest  ying tells them a story where in ancient times  their village was attacked by this extra dimensional draconic entity who can suck the ever living souls out of people and its minions can  too  but  the great protector  and sealed away behind the dark gate  trapping it for many centuries  here  we have a training montage where we see shang chi being trained in the same arts that were used to defeat wenwu  xialing practices with this what seems to be a rope dart  and chen learning archery  the next day  wenwu and the ten rings  also razor fist  and the death dealer arrive  nan tells wenwu that his wife isn't behind the dark gate  but the soul eaters were luring him to a trap we begin the climactic third act  nan fights with the death sealer  xialing fights razor fist  meanwhile  shang notices his father walking away to his wife's memorial  but is distracted by several warriors for a brief moment  as he approaches his father  he told him that he isn't afraid  episode v vibes here when luke tells yoda where he promises that he won't fail him and not be afraid  ""oh  you will be  you will be "" they begin to fight until wenwu uses the same movement that he killed the gang who killed his wife on shang into the depths of water  believing that his son is dead  he does a jedi jump moment to the dark gates using the rings to break it down and free his wife  this makes the situation worse by releasing an army of soul eaters  in the village  xialing tries to ally with razor fist to help to take down the soul eaters  his mind is changed when the death dealer's soul was sucked out  he tells the ten rings to stop and help the villagers  i have to say  this part was terrifying and how he falls dead  no movement  it is crazy how death does that  back to shang chi  he regains consciousness with the help of the great protector rising out of the water  the great protector begins to eat the soul eaters  shang chi makes his way to his father to furthermore convince him that his wife isn't behind the dark gates  wenwu ignores this  continuing the fight  wenwu uses half of his rings at his son  but shang catches them and gaining control of 'em  the fight gets more intense to the point where the dweller is unleashed and slowly absorbs wenwu's soul  during his final moments  he gives his son the rings  the battle suffered many losses including master guang bo  chen launches an arrow at the dweller's weak port  causing it to be weakened  the great protector starts to kick the ever living crap outta it  making it explode  in the aftermath  the villagers attend a ceremony as the lanterns of those who died slowly ""swam"" across the ocean  finally  it was all about a true story where shang was explaining his recent adventure to a couple  obviously  they don't believe him just until wong uses his yellow sparkly thing bringing shang and katy to discuss the rings  we get a cameo of captain marvel and bruce banner  this time  captain marvel didn't get another haircut  lol  interesting how professor hulk somehow returned to his human form  i strongly assume that his right arm is more painful since he returned as a human  in the end credits  we see xialing becoming the new leader of the ten rings there are a lot of fantastic characters here  starting off with shang chi  i have to say that he had an excellent performance where he seems to be brave  showing no cowardice to his father  has lovely chemistry with his best friend he had known for 10 years  katy  wants nothing to do with his family  often feels guilty for leaving xialing  i have to say  though  speaking of katy  i liked how she wasn't full on comedic throughout the film and became a badass  i do find it interesting that we have two archers now  hawkeye and katy  i quite like how we didn't have any romance (( besides wenwu's romantic relationship with ying li  ))wenwu  what to say on this  he is one of the best marvel villains ever  although  he wasn't one  and he had actual motives rather than being the usual mcu villain  but the storytelling is wonderful  he was a ruthless leader killing multiple people  then one day  he stumbled upon a woman  ditches away his organization  became a better caring & loving man to raise two children until his wife was killed  seeking revenge on her murder  became a flawed father having no time toward his children like ditching xialing  what  a  tragic  story  i am starting to notice that phase 4 is exploring the effects of grief like wanda's love for vision  sylvie's hatred for the tva  and corrupted doctor strange trying to bring back his love  tony leung's performance killed it  i loved how they were ditching away with the mandarin stuff i have to say that the ten rings (( no  not the organization  )) is completely badass  more interesting than the repulsors  the mjolnir  stormbreaker  a million pound sharp edged metal frisbee  the iconic scepter  a cross bow that can do many things  a prosthetic titanium/vibranium arm that can overpower almost anything  quad blasters that go pew pew  the godslayer that can cut through anything  basic daggers  a laser cannon  yaka arrow that can travel by whistling  electroshock batons  carbon fibered specialized winged jetpack  and vibranium claws  wanda's psionic energy manipulation  size/insect manipulation  web shooters  eldritch magic  and the infinity gaunlet are the only cool things along with the ten rings  you can make an energy blast  put 10 rings on one arm to do a super punch  extend into a energy whip  shields  big jumps  etc  oh yeah  i forgot to mention  the fight between wenwu & ying was god damn jaw dropping  wenwu is a 10/10 character for xu xialing  she became likable in the later halfs of the movie  her backstory is heartbreaking  because of her gender  she couldn't train with her brother shang  although  she learned to train on her own  rather than her unpleasant behavior  she has great bonds with women  emotional  a really interesting relationship with her brother  for ying nan  she is marvellous  she dealt with the loss of her sister  and wise  i enjoyed guang bo so much  he's wise  has a deep heart for his village  i was devastated of his death  trevor  i enjoyed so much for him and his deep relationship for morris  he is so fun! ""calm down  mate  i'm not actually dead  it's just a performance  play along "" i do wish that the death dealer was done better rather than being treated dirty  he was badass  completely threatening  and the same potential of taskmaster  the movie has excellent pacing  that's all i have to say ",Positive
96,"let's keep aside all these serious conversations about asian representation  diversity and all other societal stuff for a moment and let us all just appreciate marvel for creating one of the most (if not the most) emotionally charged superhero movies in recent times i'm not even exaggerating  i have been a follower of marvel since my teenage days  suffice it to say  through many ups and downs i keenly witnessed all of their works over the years  trust me when i say that they have very much revamped their strategy this time around excluding their typical set up for a comicbook blockbuster  shang chi's familial/dramatic aspects are on an all time high here  the way this story has been told  it just feels somewhat distinctive and special (especially  compared to the last few projects marvel has had come up with) other than the apparent masteries in its audio visual departments (as expected); the narrative here infuses a powerful statement  a different outlook on family & self acceptance  and guess what? it never sounded preachy nor pretentious; not for a single moment another praiseworthy characteristic is the action sequences or to be precise  all the choreography behind! an incredible show for the martial arts fans and yeah fyi simu liu (shang chi); our primary protagonist did most of his stunts  all by himself; that is amazing isn't it?pretty much the same impression applies to all the other members of the ensemble; however  i do have some serious reservations about their respective character depictions to start with  shang chi's estranged father (played by a veteran  tony leung chiu wai);
the writing on his character felt a bit detached and incoherent! don't know about you  but for the most part  i was rather uncertain about what should i exactly feel about this guy! should i be sympathetic or furious about the choices he had made? gotta say this dilemma got the better of me furthermore  the mother of shang chi (played by fala chen) from ta lo; i do feel her screentime in here should have been elongated a little bit more! just so the viewers could grasp her part of the storyline too! other than that  she  herself was pretty great in there  no complaints whatsoever  and oh yeah  nora lum or awkwafina (the name  majority of you might know her by)  she was terrific in her role as well; the much needed comic relief in such a sob story!in a nutshell  i must admit  this was a rather unprecedented gamble from marvel and it did pay off quite well in the end  to be honest  i couldn't be more pleased about that! as i see it  these superhero films tend to get repetitious over the years so it's always like a breath of fresh air whenever there is a drastic transition coming straight from the creators  and when it gets backed up by the big studios themselves; well that's your cherry on top ",Positive
97,destin daniel cretton's 'shang chi and the legend of the ten rings' marks a bland start to the new phase of marvel cinematic universe  it is a spectacle with regards to action sequence and fighting choreography  but the film misses a solid storyline for an origin story as its titular character lacks personality and does not go through any heroic transformation story arc  simu liu has a strong presence as shang chi  yet he is overshadowed by many of his more experienced co stars ,Positive
98,one of the best origin mcu films  good story  great and complex family relationships  with it's own identity  a very good balance between action and comedy and really good fight scenes  between simu liu  awkwafina and tony leung it's difficult to decide which was the best  but the acting was really strong all around (also a mention to ben kingsley  always funny!)  the best thing i can say about it is that for most of it's duration it didn't even feel like an mcu film the negatives? again  too much cgi  it's a huge problem with marvel and disney as they use the green screen in almost every scene  i like cgi but seriously  some scenes would look much better with practical effects  others would look way better if they just were shot at location ,neutral
99,i really had fun with this new marvel movie  i didn't know who shang chi was but i did my research on the character and went in on what i learned simu liu was awesome as shang chi and played the character amazingly  awkwafina was pretty funny and likable the fight scenes and stunts were all really well choreographed and really cool seeing i really liked the villain and the connection to the hero and the final fight  i found it amazing another great addition to the mcu ,Positive
100,"this is my favorite marvel movie since black panther and it's the best marvel movie of 2021 right behind no way home the fight scenes and direction were epic  the entire time i was watching this movie i thought to myself  ""maybe they can make a good live action dragon ball movie""  if they ever do  they should have destin daniel crettin direct it  he's a master of action and humor this movie is even funnier than guardians of the galaxy  one of marvel's funniest movies simu liu and ben kingsley were fantastic in this film  kingsley was hilarious and liu brought a real sense of passion to one of my favorite marvel superheroes awkwafina did a great comedic job  her character was hilarious shang chi is a nonstop action packed thrill ride from the first frame to the last  every second is rooted with either action  humor  backstory  or all of the above  i can't get over just how good the fight scenes are  along with the incredible finale  amazing cinematography  and breathtaking special effects this is one of the best mcu movies  and i'm gonna give it an a ",Positive
101,visually a perfect film for me watching a film in theatre after 20 months  going in i expected marvel to half ass the genre but still make it entertaining like a number of their other films  but i was taken aback wonderfully right from the beginning with the opening narration completely in chinese  what i saw then was a proper modern wuxia fantasy which with some changes could've fooled me for a chinese production (maybe i'm being a bit hyperbolic) as fitting to a wuxia film  the lust for power  the love that conquers evil and the despair of lost love are all seen in this film  and who best to bring all those than the legendary tony leung who was the face of hong kong cinema through in the mood for love and acted in some of the best wuxia films  he was definitely the best thing about the film  i was half expecting marvel to mess it up like they use great actors for villains all the time  but he was the first main character to appear and even till the end his presence was felt this also has some of the best hand to hand action sequences in the mcu easily  the martial arts action  even when the superpowers are included also makes the action just beautiful which is something i feel the first time in an mcu film awkwafina was quirky but what i liked there was that they kept it platonic and didn't jump into anything at any point  maybe they'd do that in the future but at least they didn't break the flow in the relationship  meng'er zhang and fala chen also made their presence felt  as badass fighters  and michelle yeoh as expected of her came in and owned the screen when she was present i'm really surprised at how much i liked the film  the final fight sequences that rose to the most epic chinese fantasy fight you can think of is the only thing i was expecting them to not mess up  maybe it is because of my low expectations on how marvel deals with the genre and the villain that made me love this so much ,Positive
102,"positives:
this is marvel at its best  a script (with shakespearean undertones) that melds action with good character development and laugh out loud feelgood dialogue  the great thing is that you don't need to be a marvel nerd to enjoy this one  yes  there are some fabulous easter eggs for marvel fans (and a wonderful return of a character from one of the early films)  but its almost a standalone feature in its own right the action sequences are top notch  particularly an early fight on a careering an francisco ""bendy bus""  some great martial arts reminiscent of ""crouching tiger  hidden dragon""  made more exciting by the fact that the impressive simu liu did all his own stunts the relationship built between shaun and katy is wonderful  and the actors deliver on it brilliantly: no wonder when you have the exceptional awkwafina on the other end of it  similarly  the relationship built between shang chi and his father is powerful  thanks to some wonderful acting from tony chiu wai leung  so good in the gripping (and erotic) 'lust  caution'  i believe this is his first english speaking film with the odd exception (see below)  the special effects are top notch negatives:
i thought this was 5* all the way until the final reel  when we descended into a cgi driven ""godzilla vs kong"" finale  i hate cgi that's just a blur of action across the screen where you're struggling to understand what's going on  less would be more here for me the movie makes extensive use of 'flashbacks' and  for me  there was a bit too much heavy handedness in their use  i muttered ""enough already"" to a few of them  since they were taking us out of the movie's current narrative there were a couple of effects that looked like the intern at the special effects company had put them together during a coffee break  an early plunge of a jeep into a forest and some rather obvious green screen stuff in the finale  surprised that these weren't caught and redone timeline?: so  it took more of a marvel nerd than i am (my wonderful daughter in law bronwyn) to point out that although this film is set (largely) in the ""present day""  the events of ""avengers: endgame"" actually happen in 2023  so in the marvel timeline  this is set in between thanos's ""blip"" and ""the return""  this is the reason why wong is present but not doctor strange  for example summary thoughts: marvel goes east! this is a really entertaining addition to the franchise  mixing marvel action with eastern mysticism and martial arts  it's an impressive job by director and co writer destin daniel cretton  in only his second feature (he did ""just mercy"" in 2019) as a marvel film  there are of course end credit scenes (""monkeys"" in onemannsmovies speak)  a mid title one is the best  bringing some additional marvel characters into the mix  and there's a post credits one which sets up for further sequels but which i found rather irritating it's ironic that a marvel movie so right for the chinese market   the first to be headlined by an asian actor and with substantial mandarin dialogue   might not get a release in china  according to this report  this appears to be for two reasons: firstly that the actor simu liu made some derogatory remarks about china in the past  and secondly that in the comics shang chi's father is fu manchu   a western derived character with racial overtones this doesn't seem to have hurt it so far  after less than two weeks of opening  it has made $262 million on a budget estimated to be $150 200 million (for the full graphical review and video check out #onemannsmovies on the web  facebook and tiktok  thanks) ",Positive
103,yet another marvel movie  but with a new mystique story  which is most entertaining  parts are in mandarin  so be prepared to read the english translation  the story and visual scenes are well done specifically because it contains a lot of cgi  the martial art scenes are likewise well choreographed  almost looking like a dance routine  more ten ring movies are in the offing ,Positive
104,shang chi is a boring film  the characters were okay  but the story was choppy and confusing  the song choices were odd  plus  this movie was way too long  and the scene at the end had me practically falling asleep ,Negative
105,shang chi is one of those marvel films that feels like the full package  it has lots of brilliant trademark mcu humour and tongue in cheek quips  it has exceptional action which i'll get into a bit more  it also has solid connections to the rest of the mcu  balanced well between being its own stand alone film but laying hints of how this is going to fit into the wider story of phase 4 i'll start with the action as this is what shang chi is famed for  quite simply it's awesome  it has the best hand to hand combat the mcu has seen  and sequences that are steeped in chinese culture  with the rhythmic style of crouching tiger hidden dragon woven into the fabric of this film the cast was brilliant  simu liu was a fantastic lead  and i'd be happy to see him grow into a big player in the mcu  awkwafina as expected was fantastic  adding so much effortless humour to the film what i really love about shang chi is that it has a very well explored and interesting antagonist  this can't always be said for marvel films as there have been a few phoned in villains  but shang chi doesn't come close to falling into this trap  tony leung really sold his role and gave it a lot of power and emotion in terms of plot they did a fantastic job of introducing us to this pretty obscure character  there is a lot of exposition and plenty of flashbacks  perhaps too many but i appreciate they had a lot of background content to feed us so i can't grumble too much  i loved how the plot was so mystical and magical  very much feeling like an epic adventure yet again marvel studios knocking it out of the park!,neutral

107,when iron man hit theatres back in 2008  there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting  but obviously  nobody expected that we would make it to a film like avengers: endgame at the time  along the way  unknown properties like guardians of the galaxy and ant man came out of nowhere as well but were welcomed with open arms  i was really hoping that shang chi and the legend of the ten rings would follow in those footsteps  and it more than does  with rich world building  a great cast  and the use of mythology  this is one of my favourite marvel cinematic universe entries to date  over time i may even come to appreciate it even more  after a first viewing  here's why shang chi and the legend of the ten rings deserves to be seen on the big screen (if you can) after being trained as an assassin by his father  shang chi (simu liu) is given ten years of freedom from this life  in the present  the film picks up with shang chi (shaun) as he is living a normal life in san francisco with his friend katy (awkwafina)  when the history/mythology of the so called ten rings is brought back into the forefront  his mission is to go and find his father  with the help of his friend and sister  they return home to face the music and it may just end up being father vs son to save this world  from start to finish  this film delves into the fun  the mythological  the family drama  and some incredible martial arts in order to tell this very solid story aside from the fact that newcomer simu liu is undeniably charming and very likeable in this role  it's the unique style of the movie that made it stand out from the rest of the marvel cinematic universe  yes  it still has the same look and feel  especially when it comes to aesthetics and comedic relief  but the rest of the film had its own distinct heartbeat  bringing martial arts into this franchise just felt like a breath of fresh air to me  not only does it feel simultaneous that they're trying to have fun and pay homage to classic films of this nature  but the fact that martial arts  mixed with actual god like powers just felt so earned by the climax of the film  without giving anything away  shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is far more magical and mystical than i was expecting  but i kind of loved the finale when looking back on it there's really not much about this film that i feel compelled to complain about  but i will say that with as much drama that this film has and with how much it does dive into mythology  sometimes the comedy felt out of place  awkwafina as katy was great and i think her chemistry with simu liu was great as well  but i think certain cuts to her one liners felt a little unnecessary for the specific situation  there are a few scenes where moments deserve our full attention  but the film felt the need to cut away to something funnier  aside from the humour taking me out a few times  this film is just a blast overall  shang chi and the legend of the tens rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and probably one of my favourite entries as a whole  director destin daniel cretton (short term 12  just mercy) has done a great job here and the cinematography by bill pope (the matrix  baby driver) was also a real standout  i thought the scope of the movie felt very grand and that's absolutely in part to how it was filmed  i almost thought the finale of the movie was going to be a huge negative  but again  after thinking about the movie again  there is a nice progression in the story that makes the climax feel earned  even if a tad overblown  if you're a fan of this franchise  this one is a must see  but even if you're not  this one can stand on its own as well  having only a few acknowledgements to previous films shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is now playing exclusively in theatres and if you're able to go in your area  i highly recommend it ,Positive
108,"if you enjoy reading my spoiler free thoughts  please follow my blog to read my full review :)""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings just became one of my absolute favorites of the entire mcu! destin daniel cretton delivers an entertainment heavy movie with arguably the best action ever seen in the cinematic universe  through the outstanding mix of long takes  impressive fighting choreography  and jaw dropping stunt work  simu liu shines with his martial arts skills  but also in tackling the identity issues of the protagonist  marvel gains yet another emotionally compelling antagonist  as well as a relatable female character that embodies many elements of the asian american culture  despite an overreliance on unnecessary  excessive exposition devices (narration  flashbacks  foreshadowing)  the story behind all the tales and legends never loses interest  from the breaking of stereotypes to a remarkable depiction of their culture  most asian viewers will certainly love this film  even more than i do  phase four is off to a remarkable start   ""rating: a ",Positive
109,marvel has supplied their fans with a fast  fresh and funny superhero adventure with unconditionally perfect amounts of exhilarating action and fascinating characters  the enthusiasm noticeably kicks off with sustainable writing  in which an appealing plot is arranged and the excellent protagonists are propped  secondly  director destin daniel cretton recieves the role of brilliantly executing the visually awakening tale there's no doubt that the real magic belongs to the epic sequences of fantastical action  with stylish martial arts battles and superb effects  shang chi's epic movie lives up to both the hype and its genre  however  there are some ridiculous and unnecessary details  it's also significant to announce the fact that the amount of action is perfect! there's not too much to the point where it's tedious and not too less to the point where all that can be remembered is the dialogue marvel flicks usually include several moments of bland dialogue between the superheroes  it occasionally grows fairly unexciting  but most of it is surprisingly gripping and the entertaining adventure rules over it  alongside the massively praised action is humour and heart pumping credits scenes if you liked this review  check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews ,Positive
110,"there are  of course  a lot of changes that had to be made between the comic book character and his disney fied counterpart  first and foremost being shang chi's paternal heritage! as marvel no longer had licensing rights to the name ""fu manchu "" the hero's villainous father had to be revised to being the true mandarin (as opposed to ben kingsley's politically incorrect caricature as a terrorist group figurehead) then  there's shang chi's sister  instead of fah lo suee (another literary character licensed to the estate of sax rohmer)  we have xu xialing  and  for shang chi's girlfriend  we get american born katy  an original character who seems to be an amalgam of leiko wu and misty knight  which only stands to reason  i suppose  as shang chi's maternal heritage seems to amalgamate his silver screen origin with the comic book origin of iron fist!most important of all  however  is the emotional plausibility  simu liu provides that  for this version of shang chi  the same way tobey maguire first brought believability to the cinematic peter parker all in all? not a bad way to transition from the end of summer into the next phase of marvel films ",Positive
111,"don't tell me    uh that question from grandmother was bound to come out  i was waiting for someone to say it interruption   how do two people in the middle of the plane get one of the last meals?""i like your spike face""    :)why are you punching yourself? my grandfather used to do that to me i'm reminded of jackie chan's quote    ""chinese bamboo very strong"" this seems sketchy burn it with her in it? nuts weird horse :)michelle yeoh is your relative! cool!so you have to dress appropriately to shoot idiot hitting a ""lion"" i was wondering what happened to sir ",neutral
112,this was the right direction for marvel to head post endgame  finding new stories to tell within cultures rarely explored is the way for the mcu to continue to entertain the fights in the first third of this movie were absolutely brutal and quite innovative  i wish they hadn't front loaded all of this stunning choreography since the fights later on paled in comparison  this film also contains arguably the most beautiful and artful scene in the mcu with the crouching tiger inspired hidden garden duel  there was a sense of more indie based filmmaking and i really enjoyed that fresh take on the genre  i would be remiss not to mention tony leung  who perfectly brings to life one of the finest villains in the mcu  his character has a lot of depth and is one you can truly empathize with while there are still the tropes expected in a marvel origin film  it succeeds pretty well for the most part  i wish the big cgi battle at the end had just been a personal fight between father and son  but alas  the humor  especially awkwafina  was pretty hit or miss as well  the trevor slattery stuff was great though shang chi is definitely one of the best origin films in the mcu and really stands out as a unique entry in the long running series ,Positive
113,hollywood trying to be too woke about being chinese always hate it when they make a villain not really a villain as to not offend anyone  shang chi's father is supposed to be a pure villain  the mother storyline took away a lot from the real storyline awkwafina's character becoming a boss archer after one day of training was equally ridiculous hopefully if a sequel is made it will be darker  though i'll admit the mandarin was a funny touch ,neutral
114,"the next instalment of the mcu  shang chi and the legend of the ten rings has come out and i managed to see it the other day and i have finally found time to review it and here is my review for it  the premise of the film sees a young martial artist forced to face his past when his criminal father comes hunting for him main character
relative unknown simu liu plays shang chi and he is really good in this role  he really delivers a strong performance and you will come out of the film really liking him and caring about the character of shang chi  the focus on his family dynamic is really well done and liu does a great job in selling that and showing the pain that he has been through in his life and bringing this great hero to life  he is also fantastic in the action scenes and that is a huge part of this film and you have to believe in the heroes capabilities and i really did supporting characters
awkwafina plays his best friend katy and i feel like this character is really going to split opinion  some will hate her  some will love her  i pretty much hit both ends of the spectrum  i thought she was really annoying in the first act of the film and it hurt my enjoyment  but as she had her role slightly lessened she became much more likeable and her character arc became very clear  tony leung plays his first role in an american film playing wenwu and this is one of the best antagonists in the current mcu  i loved this character and performance  he isn't just some generic bad guy and at times i really understood his motivations and saw the emotion from his performance and it was really strong  meng'er zhang plays xialing and i liked her character here and i thought it really complemented shang chi really well  there is clearly issues there and the film plays it up well  and makes her more then just this female sidekick and she is given a personality story
the story is at its strongest when it focuses on the family issues between the characters  in particular shang chi and wenwu  that father and son dynamic is great and both actors deliver really well in their roles and it makes there clashes feel even more important as you genuinely care about both of them in the film  the issue is that the film kind of strays away from that and tries to focus on too much  it has plenty of exposition scenes and fits so much in that it distracts from the main thing that makes this film great  the final act puts the focus in the wrong place  its hard to explain without spoilers but i think you will know what i mean if you watch the film script
the script is okay  the drama is really well done and made me care about these characters and the emotional predicaments that they are put in during this adventure and i actually think this film is held back a little bit by the fact that it is in the mcu  what i mean by that is that it has the humour you come to expect from the universe is here but it is done poorly and i never really laughed at all and that was a disappointment style
the film looks fantastic  the cgi is all beautiful and i think it does an excellent job of building this world of martial arts that is very different to other elements of the mcu  the fight scenes live up to the hype and are the best that have been seen in the marvel cinematic universe  the flow so well and are so hard hitting that it is easily the best element of the film overall
overall  shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is a great film and another solid addition to the marvel cinematic universe  it isn't top tier marvel but does a great job of introducing a new hero in shang chi rating   8/10 ",Positive
115,when i saw the trailer the movie looked awful what surprised me in this movie is  its actually pretty funny the first half was good the second half was okay ,Positive
116,"""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" is the second film in phase four of the marvel cinematic universe (mcu)  starring simu liu  tony leung  and awkwafina  it elevates itself above the typical superhero origin story by incorporating many fantastic elements from asian culture in san francisco  shaun (simu liu) works as a parking valet along with his close friend katy (awkwafina)  unbeknownst to katy  shaun is hiding important secrets from her   he is in fact a skilled martial artist whose real name is shang chi and he has run away from his father xu wenwu (tony leung)  the leader of the powerful ten rings organisation  after some ten rings members attack the pair of them on a bus  shang chi discovers that they have stolen a valuable pendant given to him by his mother li (fala chen) before he left for the united states  shang chi grows concerned that the ten rings' next target will be the pendant belonging to his younger sister xialing (meng'er zhang)  and so along with katy he sets off to look for her before the gang can locate her first now that the infinity saga has concluded  the time has come for some new heroes to enter the mcu  of course  there are so many to choose from  considering the large roster of characters that have come into existence over the last several decades  although shang chi wasn't the first one to come to my mind when predicting who would lead the charge of fresh faces into phase four  his debut big screen outing ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" successfully cements him as a memorable hero just as worthy as any other past avenger what i believe separates this film from the typical hero origin story is all of the interesting aspects of asian culture it integrates into the story  i'm all for inclusivity in movies  so long as it isn't shoehorned in there for the sake of appeasing a political agenda  and here it succeeds greatly thanks to the wide array of asian crew members who worked hard to ensure that virtually all customs are represented  the film never precisely establishes the place shang chi's family is from (though it is hinted to be somewhere in mainland china)  as they are seen observing various cultural traditions that don't quite narrow things down to one particular asian country  for example  there are martial artists resembling shaolin monks  who are supposed to be from china  seen using techniques from japanese and korean folklore  this has likely been done on purpose to ensure that all asian audiences feel included  but never so much that it comes across as disrespectful  after previously bungling asian related matters with the terrible 2020 remake of ""mulan""  ""shang chi"" feels like an appropriate apology from disney to all of their viewers at this stage  it feels pointless to complain about marvel films following the exact same template when introducing new heroes so i won't hold that against this one too much  with that said  thanks to some brilliantly choreographed martial arts fight scenes and gorgeous visuals  director destin daniel cretton (""just mercy"") has provided us with one of the most unique looking mcu films to date  one scene near the beginning features xu wenwu walking through a bright  beautiful oriental garden complete with bamboo reeds in the foreground  a short time later  he is locked in hand to hand combat with his future love interest li  this reminded me of ""wuxia"" films  a popular subgenre of chinese martial arts movies  like ""crouching tiger  hidden dragon""  in fact  this scene was such a good tribute to that genre that i almost forgot this was a marvel movie and was instead watching one of those classic kung fu films my dad used to show me when i was young  you know you've created something special when your film can appeal this effectively to fans of both marvel and kung fu movies considering the last thing i saw him in was the sitcom ""kim's convenience""  simu liu definitely took me by surprise as to how well cast he was as the film's main star  i was expecting him to be a wisecracking americanised version of the asian hero but he actually plays most of the film straight  only responding humorously when absolutely necessary  his dramatic side truly shines when he is interacting with his onscreen father tony leung  in fact  leung's character xu has one of the most tragic backstories of any character in the whole mcu  which i won't spoil here  another surprise was awkwafina as shang chi's best friend katy  rather than being another typical love interest  katy is instead a loyal platonic friend of his who is willing to help him out no matter how limited her knowledge on the field of battle may be  it also helps that she is responsible for most of the film's comic relief with a new superhero now officially introduced  it's safe to assume that ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" has shown an optimistic future for the mcu  its broad appeal to eastern and western audiences alike as well as the usual action packed fun we've come to expect over the years makes it one of the best origin films to come out of the mcu to date  the marvel hype train shows no signs of slowing down and if things keep going the way they are  it won't be stopping anytime soon i rate it 8 5/10 ",Positive
117,"what more do you want?i honestly didn't want to like this film  as you may have read in previous reviews of the marvel films  they are all dumb  and this one ends as they all do  with just massive cgi chaos  but did i mention they were dragons fighting?anyway  the film is fun  fun and lively in the sense of watching a water painting come to life  the fight sequences are laborious   sometimes  since being rocked with energy source that could topple buildings doesn't even crack a rib seems silly but shang chi makes it work  here played by the moon faced wide eyed and fun loving simu liu  and he does a wonderful job not wanting to be anything but a typical slacker  while he carries the burden of a darker past  haunted  even   he does his best to make the best of his situation with his san fran pal katy  now usually awkwafina irritates me to no end  here  she is much more subdued and is truly a ""bro"" any guy would want in a sisterly form/love interest  the balance of her hip banter to seriousness is flawless  and quite the joy when not on screen big kudos to tony leung  who has spent generations emoting with the most efficient use of words  he doesn't require much and carries a lot  he plays a former evil doer whose only motivation is love his fatherly love for his children is only surpassed by regaining a love he's lost  and truly embodies that person who cannot let it go  but that credit goes to li  played by fala chen  a gentle soul in what can be described as shangri la  i could watch her do kata for hours  her gracefulness would make any man want to open the gates of hell for much praise goes to director destin cretton for balancing spirituality with family ties  this is a very difficult line to tow while trying not to be overbearing  he was smart enough to know that the family dynamics of an asian household have small passive aggressive moments that pick at the main characters  but doesn't ever go past the ""you must have honor"" trope that infects a movie like ""mulan""",Positive
118,the bus fight scene is one of the best action scenes of the entire mcu  just for that scene alone  this movie deserves to be watched on the biggest screen possible  shang chi benefited from being a very unknown character and the movie gives him the opportunity to shine bright with his development  the story is really fast paced and even if the final act succumbs to the typical marvel esque  it leaves you with a pretty solid good feeling while leaving the cinema  a really great mcu movie  a superb martial arts spectacle and a great step up for the phase 4  do not miss the two post credits scenes  the middle scene is exciting and the very last one is pretty intriguing  bring it on  marvel!,Positive
119,the birth of a new marvel hero  and a very successful one  one of the better marvel adaptations of the recent years and the perfect introduction of this new hero its packed with amazing action  a great legacy and a wisely picked cast who get the chance to portray fun characters to start with simu liu who shoots himself to stardom with this film  his portrayal was fun as he perfectly mixes the hero attitude with a nice tongue in cheek humor and perfectly develops himself without taking all of it too seriously  same goes to his co star awkwafina who was perfectly cast  having tony leung as the to center part was an excellent creative decision  then the film has some fan favorites appearing as ben kingsley's trevor or benedict wong who round it up to a wonderful marvel adventure  just as you would expect the action scenes are tremendous  as the film is filled with great martial arts sequences  (of course michelle yeoh is not to be missed here)  the bus scene at the beginning is a true stand out action scene in the entire marvel universe really a good one for the next phase of marvel  and i like how it links to the whole universe just perfectly  another marvel winner ,Positive
120,cool worlds/ten rings vfx  okayish plot  good characterisations but somehow somewhere it felt like the film was actually made for kids maybe because of the story being wholly dependent on the magical dragon also  there could've been some heavy emotions & more action sequences & some twists/turns in the script to have more grip on the audience  overall  it was a good watch but could've been still better ,Positive
121,ben kingsley won this movie  and it was not particularly close  probably the stunt coordinator came in a distant second? anyway  i did laugh quite a bit  and the fight scenes were better than your average marvel film   but not everything was better than average  most of it was just about average  actually  special effects: average  characterization: average  plot twists: average  i still enjoyed myself  and still appreciated marvel transforming an exploitative property into something culturally rich  but the diminishing returns of marvel joints continues ,Positive
122,a cultural celebration  much like black panther  what a fantastic cast  and they all delivered a praiseworthy performance  i was usually gets annoyed by awkwafina  but she was actually likable in this film and she did a pretty decent job  the action sequences were so dope and brilliant  the fight scenes were so unique and innovatively phenomenal ,Positive
123,very glad i watched this at the movies  really made its epicness standout  and what a standout! i loved this  the humour was great  awkwafina is always hysterical at all the right moments  simu liu had the abs to rule a dynasty and the mythology was simple enough for me to follow  i could have done with slightly less cgi dragon fighting but overall a true marvel to watch ,Positive
124,as far as visuals go  this movie is amazing    like just about as impressive as dune  it's filled to the brim with eye candy the plot/story however is mediocre and filled with plot holes    the characters' actions are often unrealistic and they will often just 'stare in awe' at their friends being killed  instead of doing the realistic thing  and immediately defending their friends    it's something that happens like 5 times and honestly spoils the movie for me     if characters in a movie don't act or react realistically and stare at something like a braindead zombie (like their friends getting killed right in front of them  whilst they are holding a gun in their freeking hands)  then it's just really terrible script/plot writing overall  the movie isn't as bad as ant man 2 but it's not far behind  also  awkwafina's acting style was already old by the 2nd movie she did    all of her characters in movies are the same person  and like i said  it got boring after the 2nd movie  i roll my eyes at everything awkwafina's character does in the movie it's a 5/10 movie  not really worth a watch unless you're a real die hard marvel fan ,neutral
125,"another great and entertaining experience which is very similar to what has gone before in format  but the formula works very well and i enjoyed the film a lot  the asian style and presentation is beautiful  showing off plenty of folklore and style in both modern and traditional settings  the presentation is very stylish  the special effects were superb and the martial arts fight scenes were fast and exciting
the plot is good  focusing on the human and family side of the characters rather than the magical  and sets up a good intrigue for the continuation of the mcu  the acting is good and although the comic relief and cute character did change things up  they also spoiled it a bit and made the slow middle section drag on even more  the ending was pretty grand and epic  but i felt it could have been better ",Positive
126,martial arts movies pretty much dominated the 70's 80's and 90's  that was it's hey day   then it fell out of favor with the viewing crowd  except for quick focused scenes in some later movies  now marvel is apparently trying to bring it back to its former glory in shang chi   unfortunately they forgot to bring back the excitement though  as this outing has little more than drawn out martial arts scenes performed one right after the other  leaving any real background story in the dust   the acting is mediocre at best  and what story there is sort of breezes past you if you aren't paying attention  which i wasn't by about 30 minutes into this   i see it does have a 7 6 aggregate score at the moment  so the new generation of adventure addicts apparently like it anyway   i wonder how long it will stay there  will it go up or down  we shall see   p  s  ben kingsley couldn't even save this one  but i did get a few laughs from his performance as usual   ,Positive
127,"i have to say i was looking forward to this one  first film in a while that had no connection to avengers etc so i was intrigued to see how they would do this  and on the whole it was very enjoyable and fun to watch!first instincts when watching were a little mixed  it was an odd start to say the least and didn't have any idea how this was going to go  and my first instincts on katy were also mixed  i felt like they were trying to force the humour out on her and i found her character really annoying  however  once it gets going the film gets better and better  katy becomes a great character and all the characters development and arcs on a whole were truly phenomenal! for me the best part of the film was the characters and seeing them all develop throughout so is the plot good? to be blunt  yes! it's truly unique and uniquely done in so many ways  i don't want to give out anything that would spoil anything  but it's really not what you expect  that's all i say!just an add on for this point  i will say there was a couple of points where it was quite obvious what was going to happen (ie when sister pops up for first time  you know exactly how about 10 mins before it happens)  i think the final battle scene went on a bit longer than it needed to  but these are minor points that don't distract you or take anything away from the film itself i'll shut up now! i'll just say it's well worth watching  it's a great ""superhero"" to have and a great one to watch  and overall it's a fun  visually pleasing and brilliant watch  i recommend ",Positive
128,"shang   chi is the new hero of the mcu and everyone is going to love him  although i have a really deep criticism over fase 4 of the marvel cinematic universe  i've decided to go watch the movie in theaters (after two years of being away from theaters due to covid)  overall i really enjoyed it  there were still a few moments that i regretted and that were dull  not to mention ""little mistakes"" that marvel keep doing with their movies  in general it was a fun experience  the plot didn't have much to offer to be honest: another origin story of a superhero that tries to run away from his fate and responsibilities  until he is forced to face his past this has been the kind of way for marvel to introduce their new characters in the mcu  i wished they would have been more creative but they do deliver creativity for once  watching people speak their native language for once was a huge step up for marvel  the movie is also influenced by many other asian classic films such as ""hero""  ""hidden dragon""  ""seven samurai"" and ""in the mood for love"" of course it wouldn't be a marvel movie without some end credits scenes (how original)  the end credit scene does confirm the return of shang chi at some point  but what the end credits scene does confirm moreover is how the future marvel films will all get connected  as i said before  i'm less optimistic with this whole fase 4 of marvel but it wouldn't hurt or kill to watch a few of them  to me  i just wanted to return to the theaters speaking of actors: simu liu is a fantastic actor and will definitely become a fan favorite  both him and his character  awkwafina steals the show every single time she's on screen  tony leung is wonderful and acts so well  the whole cast is perfect  if you are in favor of theaters and marvel movies than go watch shang chi p  s: the end credit song   fire in the sky by anderson paak  is the best part of the movie ",Positive
129,marvel are in desperate need of good writers!the story and script are both confusing and beyond cheesey !it really saddens me as i was once a big marvelfan but since the passing of stan lee and disney taking over it has produced a lot of trash!the marvel i once enjoyed will never be the same it has been turned into yet another disneyfied production ,Positive
130,"great writing and amazing action scenes make ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" the best marvel project   film and series  since endgame  it also a nice way to change that awful iron man 3 twist ",Positive
131,this film manages to introduce the character in this universe  but the story that unfolds is boring the conflict changes several times  it even takes the main character to a lake to concentrate on something else  it becomes cyclical  it is incongruous  it has many script holes  you do not feel much emotion when the fights appear  the visuals are very good  the editing is good most of the time  although the sound of some mythological elements is not very good  like the performance of the actor who plays the antagonist  the ending feels a bit forced this film is not innovative in the genre and is predictable  making it somewhat boring ,Positive
132,best fight scenes since the civil war airport scene  they mess up simply by trying to make the character 10 years younger then the actor is  but aside from that i thought it was awesome  plenty of cool action fight scenes  goes a little off the rails at the end with way too much cgi for what was a relatively grounded movie to start  great addition to mcu   especially after the quality level the shows have been ,Positive
133,shang chi is a must see! the film was incredible  the story concept was very beautiful and i liked all of the cast and i usually dislike at least one person but in this case everyone made his perfect  having being a comic book fan i knew this was going to be am inenze adventure  j am very familiar with the shang chi volumes and i have never been so entertained by a marvel movie like this in a very long time i really did wnjoy this film  the effects were on another leve  truly remarkable  i highly recommend this masterpiece  well done marvel!,Positive
134,i have just watched this movie  i am an avid marvel fan  this film introduces a new character  there is that standard disney approach  with a mix of comedy  seriousness and lots of action disney work through the numbers on this film  there are no surprises and it does what it does on the tin the acting is good  special effects are solids and the story is not bad there's continuity linking to the other marvel universe which is nice for the fans i would actually pitch this at 7 5/10  not quite an 8 but higher than a 7those review of 1 or 2 out of ten are way off the mark  this film is not that bad ,Positive

recommendedthe story and making is worth to watch in big screen with good sound system  the first half is filled with great actions and funny moments and it get into serious mode in the second half the second half is more traditional and sentimental    the decent story and colourful visual makes this so grand   
good movie to watch with family ",Positive
136,with this film  marvel shows that there is still no end in sight  and it is getting crazier and more imaginative  the most interesting marvel world so far  with interesting mythical creatures that you won't find anywhere else  definitely a visually stunning film  but in which you should definitely deal a little with far eastern culture  not a classic superhero film  on the contrary: marvel is becoming mystical ,Positive

138,"""i gave you ten years to live your life  and where did that get you? you walked in my shadow ""marvel studios' shang chi and the legend of the ten rings follows shang chi  a seemingly ordinary young man from san francisco who parks cars for a living alongside his friend  as must confront the past he thought he left behind when he is drawn into the web of the mysterious ten rings organization  marvel took a big chance on this project  of course we've had lesser known heroes end up getting their own movie franchise within the mcu  but shang chi is not one many know about  little was known going in other than we'd get some action scenes and explore new territory within the mcu  what they managed to do with shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is unlike any marvel movie yet  destin daniel cretton takes a new approach that works wonders  his previous works of short term 12 and just mercy are heartfelt dramas so something big like this is new territory  but he incorporates the same style and messages into this  the dysfunctional family dynamic serving as the character arc and forming the conflict is so much deeper than some random business guy who wants to rule the world  with this story  it's easy to connect with it and understand character motives  i will say there's a lot to pack in here and the story can get muddy at points  but it pulls itself together that we retain most of everything simu liu is fantastic in the title role  previous to watching  i hadn't seen him in anything  but he has all the skills as an emerging actor to be a household name  shang chi is an interesting character to follow  as he discovers and recalls moments from his upbringing  we can slowly piece him together  there's much more to be made from him  but with future installments we'll be able to get much more  and tony chiu wai leung is perfectly cast as xu wenwu  he's a villain i can understand  like  and dislike all at the same time  he's flawed  but there's depth to him  and he almost steals the show by the end with another showcase of mad acting skills  but the character i've been thinking of a lot  and mainly because she was so hilarious  is awkwafina as katy  awkwafina is one of my favorite actresses working right now  especially after her role in the farewell  and she smashes this  katy is the typical comedic sidekick but so much fun  one of the funniest jokes comes from her and i was laughing hysterically  maybe more character will come from her later  but what we got was enough for me  i can't wait to see her again! i should also mention meng'er zhang as xialing  this is her first role and she's also great  what they'll do with her next should be interesting from a technical standpoint  this is impressive for a marvel movie  there are some stunning visuals  the cinematography isn't that gray color scheme used in most  though it does fall into that later on  and bursting with color  and as you probably know  the visual effects are as good as they come  it's not muddled with cgi and a scene that was completely green screen  which is nice to see  also  marvel has been doing great with the themes and score lately because this is another great one  along with the soundtrack  paired with this are the best fight scenes out of the whole mcu  the stunt choreography is top notch and is beautiful and intense to look at  the bus scene early on is the best yet and will be hard to top! shang chi and the legend of the ten rings just really did it for me and most everybody can agree  it's refreshing and captivating in every way  marvel has been taking some big leaps with this new phase and it gets me more and more excited for each new installment!",Positive
139,i guess it's good to have an asian superhero  this movie follows the marvel formula to infinity  reluctant hero  comic relief (two of them)  messed up family  hidden ancient city  monsters trying to end the world  fight scenes that last too long  etc  etc  etc  what i really liked was seeing juan ,Positive
140,"**what i didn't love**some decision making by the characters were a little bit off putting and unclearmotivations likewiseplot  pacing  storyline were a little off in some places (e g  shang chi's power progression was a questionable moment for me; bit of an abrupt ending)theaters are really trying to milk the pre show value    it was close to 35 minutes dammit**what i liked (not in a particular order)**great music  gonna check out the actual soundtrack (bibi is on it!!)cg was straight up amazing  in comparison to some recent marvel movies i watched (cough black widow cough)  they really pulled it off on this oneawkwafina is hilarious  she really carried this movie  added the lightness that is present in all marvel moviesrings as a weapon is such an amazing concept  they really visualized it wellmartial arts actions scenes were not as cringe as i expected (except for the one where they fall in love)i really appreciate the growing asian representation in hollywood films  they really did a good job making it culturally ""asian"" but not cringe like    some other examples!overall  pretty solid marvel film   i hope to see this franchise grow and evolve as this movie was by far not perfect but really good for a starter;",Positive
141,"""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" is a superhero origin story which seems more like a chinese martial arts film than the next entrant in the marvel cinematic universe (mcu)  many years ago i saw ""crouching tiger  hidden dragon"" and found the fight scenes in that literally unbelievable a lot of the time  ""shang chi"" often seems subtle in its fight scenes by comparison but then does have action sequences which are more like mcu superhero films  as an origin story  it assumes no familiarity with the mcu and in fact plays mostly as a non mcu film  which is what i liked about it simu liu plays shang chi/shaun  the son of a mobster  xu wenwu (played by tony leung) who could quite easily have been the subject of a film or franchise himself  due to his legendary characteristics  shang chi's mother ying li (played by fala chen) is also a legendary kind of character  this contrast of 'eastern' legendary figures and 'western' mcu legendary figures worked to the former's advantage  as the latter often come across as plastic toy figurines being used in a sandpit by small boys to play with the plot concerns how shang chi/shaun sought to move from under the shadow of his father to become his own man but just when he thought he was out  he is pulled back into wenwu's orbit  the film mixes the seriousness  perhaps  of chinese martial arts films with the jokey style of american hollywood films  as should be expected from a mcu film  eventually the fate of the world will come into play and someone will have to play the hero to save it the martial arts in this film juxtaposes frenetic fight sequences with elegant and fluid fight scenes which have their own particular charm  other times the action sequences seem lifted from a disney live action family film and that was enjoyable too  if you just suspended disbelief speaking of comedy  i found the earliest instance of this to be aiming very low for laughs  which isn't uncommon in mcu films but i warmed to later instances of it  for instance  i was amused by the character of a thespian who sounded like he was from liverpool  when he reminisced about what he took from a film that he saw as a teenager and how that inspired him to get into acting  that actor playing the thespian did seem familiar  perhaps for his voice but i did recognise his name in the closing credits and remembered the role that he is perhaps best known for an interesting aspect to this film is its subject matter  i e  an asian superhero and a mostly asian cast  is this another attempt by hollywood to crack the now important chinese market? if it is  then the cooling relations between the us and china is an unwelcome fly in the ointment for hollywood studios trying to make a lot of money from chinese cinemagoers another question that came into my mind was whether ""the ten rings"" is based on chinese legend or is a marvel appropriation of chinese culture  tailored for 'western' audiences that don't care about cultural authenticity  if it isn't the former  then i think that there could be a niche for films which mine authentic 'eastern' legends and myths  that could be something which might interest me (sinophiles would no doubt reel out a long list of films which have done just that!) as you might have guessed  i wasn't the first in line to see this film  in fact  i wasn't even sure that i wanted to see it  as i haven't watched every line of superhero films in the mcu (maybe i should watch ""the black panther""?)  as it stands  i think it was worth the punt in seeing it  i'd go so far as to say that seeing a sequel to this would be more appealing if it wasn't tied to the avengers franchise! furthermore  i would have liked this film not to remind that it was part of the mcu  which it managed to do  at least until the closing credits  which i didn't welcome when it made its first appearance  with that being said  this is the kind of film that you could watch again  after a suitable break  although i didn't watch this film in 3d  it might be worth it to do so (as sometimes the extra cost of the ticket gives added value to the experience and   sometimes it doesn't) notes to self:* the narrative did have some logical gaps in it  for example why shang chi was attacked on the bus  what was that all about?* the film was dedicated to the memory of brad allan  i think  not sure who that was   searching now  a few websites list him as the supervising stunt coordinator * reading the closing credits  i was reminded that this film was shot in australia  which isn't obvious watching it  so  good job studio (i think i saw or heard something on abc in australia about how asian australians got to be in this film  perhaps a kung fu exponent or exponents)!* my score for this film was tracking from 75% (7 out of 10 stars) to 75+% (8 out 10 stars) to just a flat 80% final score ",Positive
142,shang chi and the legend of the ten rings far surpassed any expectations i had  it's easily the best marvel movie post infinity saga (i know  that's not exactly saying much)  and is very promising for the quality of marvel's next projects  we have probably the second best villain intimately tied to the origin of a new  entertaining  and capable hero full of potential  in a story that ties the universe together and teases upcoming events in tantalising and unexpected ways  the fight choreography was on point  the dialogue was seeped in cultural significance  the jokes all land  and the cgi is some of the best since thanos himself  shang chi is an all out success for marvel  it seems in multiple ways   both critically and financially  really its only downfall is that at times this doesn't feel like that much of a movie about shang chi himself purely because his origin is tied so closely to the story of the ten rings  instead it's a ten rings movie featuring shang chi  which is fine  but feels a bit weird for his introduction into the mcu  and yes  the ten rings are tied up with the iron man films perfectly  almost making the whole aldrich killian thing better in retrospect  i give shang chi a high 8/10  with promise of moving up with rewatches ,Positive
143,i didn't intended to watch this as i thought  it is redundant mcu really doesn't need to include this  though this is not connected to avengers and entirely included in mcu  from my perceptive but however  i loved it  this story  actions and visuals are amazing  story is simple but so beautifully presented ,Positive
144,without a doubt the best action sequences in a marvel film and the best action scenes too  one of the best marvel films also  a great story and great acting  loved this film ,Positive
145,for sure the best movie in this newest marvel era  simu liu and awkwafina are really strong and offer a great performance  even the fight sequences were interesting and very well choreographed  and this is coming from someone who doesn't usually like that  all in all a very strong entry in the series ,Positive
146,shang chi is best entry in mcu  after long time  we got to see a proper marvel movie  movie had all the elements which a great movie should have it had a good story  good performances by cast  stunning visuals  great action and a proper blend of humour and drama  the last 30 minutes were stunning to watch  i loved the climax  it was beautiful and full of action overall  this movie is a total cinematic experience which you should not miss  it is one of the best origin based movie of marvel studios ,Positive
147,"i can't decide whether i loved this movie because it's great or if it's just the best cinematography bill pope's done since the wachowski's ""the matrix"" trilogy?either way  ""shang chi"" is easily the most visually distinctive & stunning film in the mcu thus far   vibrant  kinetic  gorgeously framed / composed  with its own individualistic sense of personality   & the symbiosis between the fight choreography & camera work supercedes that of any previous installment in the marvel franchise   resulting in an incredible style that works effortlessly throughout    i can't stress this enough   some moments are honestly breathtaking (my jaw was on the floor) & it's an utter joy to see such expertly constructed & perfectly timed sequences   of pure  unapologetic cinema   unfold  allows the audience the uncommon opportunity to just sit back & relax whilst watching  safe in the knowledge those responsible for bringing the screenplay to life are trustworthy  capable hands  hence  the creator's dependability reassures viewers that they can simply focus on enjoying the experience instead  making it even more fun although i shouldn't be surprised everything's captured so masterfully   considering the reliably quirky inventiveness of the visionary director of photography at the helm of the project   despite his legendary status  i still wasn't expecting a solo film (made by such an infamously corporate production company which normally shuns creative experimentation of any kind  churning out unadventurous  generic  copy + paste origin stories) to be so shockingly well realised on screen  it would consequently make ""avengers: endgame"" look embarrassingly trivial & unengaging by comparison    yet somehow  under the watchful eye of director destin daniel cretton  together  this duo manage to accomplish exactly that successfully  capturing scenes with a unique confidence i rarely (if ever) see in recent comic book adaptations for instance  usually  i can't stand the bland  dull  grey  lifeless aesthetics of disney movies (renowned for their very ugly colour grading & over reliance on cgi) but the filmmaking here feels as uncharacteristically bold  audacious  awe inspiring  original  immersive & as epic as james wan's ""aquaman"" or james cameron's ""avatar""  utilising vfx effectively to enhance the scale of the tale being told  rather than detract from the overall plot  of course  technically impressive world building & enormous scale / grandiosity are meaningless qualities & hollow attributes to possess if the narrative lacks depth or engaging characters but thankfully  this offers just enough heart to additionally feel emotionally investable  as well as spectacular wish i could've seen this in the theatre ",Positive
148,this movie was a fist in the face or rather a razor fist  i don't know if the movie is bad or i can't watch marvel movies anymore but i didn't like anything about this movie  neither the story  nor the special effects  nor the acting  it all seemed too exaggerated and predictable  plus two hours is really too much for a movie of this type the only interesting parts were the first minutes where you see the meeting between the parents and the clash between the abomination and the monk whose name i don't remember i think instead the worst part was the final battle  even the too long and exaggerated one ,Negative
149,best superhero movie ever made  shang chi was epic on every level ,Positive
150,i found this movie quite entertaining  with a lot of action and very good fight scenes  and as it can not miss in marvel movies  the good comedy part too ,Positive
151,shang chi and the legend of the ten rings we follow the story of a guy named shang(simu liu) who lives your basic life in san francisco  working as a valet parking car  and partying late nights with his best friend katy(awkwafina)  until one day a band of assassins targets shang and it's revealed that he's actually an assassin trained at birth by his father wenwu(tony leung chiu wai)  the leader of the ten rings an ancient chinese organization that's existence for thousands of years  conquering kingdoms and overthrowing governments  now shang chi must faces his father and overcome the demons of his past  each of these marvel films i find most enjoyable is the world building  set up of this universal series  all these characters from various backgrounds and classes and worlds  shang chi i can say is one of those welcome new additions  similar to guardians of the galaxy when this was announced i hadn't the slightest idea who this guy was  usually when people think martial artists with marvel they usually think iron fist or daredevil  so going into this i had a blank expectation of what to see  it does pay tribute to old school martial arts films while mixing fast action charm of a comic book with a blend of chinese mythology and philosophy  it does helps gives the movie an identity and the characters overall i found them good not great  but i found them entertaining and likable  shang's more or less just an ordinary guy just trying to live his life  have fun make a new start and make the best of it  he's honestly more or less happy with his basic life  though at the same time running from his old life his father mother and sister  it all leaves an impact on him as a person  he's pretty emotional not peter parker emotional  but he still has a personality outside of just having a stoic shaolin fighter serious persona  they could have easily done a chosen one theme with him that been done to death  he likes to joke and have fun along with his friend katy  awkwafina i'm not a fan of her i didn't really care for her in crazy rich asians or raya and the last dragon  here i found her character more funny and likable  she doesn't really come off as that annoying friend that's more or less in the way  her and simu do play well off each other and display this friendship of two different people who still very similar  i got sort of rush hour vibe off them  there's even a fight scene outside on a bamboo scaffolding  she's not just a pointless tagalong she does have moments where the jokes don't work   though she does add to the film specifically in the finale  the tone of the movie still finds time to flesh them out  more or less the two of them are just goofballs at the beginning  once more's revealed it does take time to have it's more deep serious moments  wenwu i found to be a really good villain and while technically this still isn't really the mandarin that comic readers we're probably expecting  his overall character is very compelling he more borders the line like killmonger  you understand his reasons though his actions are unjustifiable  he does still manages to gives off this somewhat opposing demeanor not from his fighting  but from the way he present his self  i buy this guy used to be a tyrant and a conqueror  i still wish his rings worked the same way though  really he just throws them like chakra and whips them around  as for the sister she's given minimal in this not really alot of moments  outside of her childhood flash backstory it's clear later down the road their gonna do something her  the visuals are stunning to this one water effect the just pops off the screen  the use of elements being shown through the right use of slow motion  the landscape of tao lo which has this very traditional chinese style with nine tail foxes  and fu dog(lions) that make that the rhinos from black panther looks bad  i want to see more places like this in future installments  a lot of these cg effects are on par with doctor strange ,Positive
152,now that we're finally into the fourth phase of the marvel cinematic universe  we're getting to see the deep cuts from everyone's favorite superhero community  despite having an unnecessarily long title  'shang chi and the legend of the ten rings' is a fun ride that doesn't feel like a retread of marvel films past the introduction to shaun (shang chi  portrayed by simu liu) is handled well  as the character is likable and feels like a good fit among the established members of s  h  i  e  l  d  comic relief comes in the form of awkwafina's katy   sidekick to shaun   and an atypical showing by sir ben kingsley  while more serious performances are delivered by veteran actors tony chiu wai leung and michelle yeoh as for the plot  it can almost be split in two  as the first and second halves of 'shang chi' feel like completely different films  the first half is very unserious and comes off as a companion to the latest 'spider man' entries  whereas the second half is a more traditional marvel action drama  even though there are plenty of typical superhero tropes thrown in here with even more of a disney imprint than past mcu movies  it's still enjoyable for what it is the somewhat surprising strength of 'shang chi' suggests there's no slowing down in the mcu film factory ,Positive
153,"i have to say that this was a surprisingly good movie  i say surprisingly because marvel (or dc for that matter) have not exactly excelled in making even decent movies for quite some time  that the woke ""critics"" on rotten tomatoes gave it high ratings was a bit of a red flag as well but not only was the movie rather free from woke ramblings and preaching but it was a very fun and entertaining movie to watch the movie starts off in a somewhat bizarre way with shang chi and his girlfriend swiping a car from a valet parking and going for a joy ride  it turns out that they are telling their story to a couple of friends and that is pretty much how this movie is told it begins more or less right away with some nice action and it continues that away with plenty of action sequences intermixed with story telling  the action and martial arts is really good in my opinion  they are in stark contrast to the mediocre rubbish we were treated to in snake eyes  the latter which was quite a disappointment this movie relies heavily on fantasy elements with tie ins to doctor strange  especially towards the end  another movie that i liked a lot by the way  thus there are of course plenty of special effects and cgi  most of them good or very good  i really liked the beautiful world of ta lo  the combat scenes  especially when the rings are in action are both cool and beautiful there are quite a lot of comical relief in the movie as well and  for once  it is not to silly  outrageous or plain stupid  it contributes well to the enjoyment factor of the movie  the washed out actor is a bit on the limit but otherwise it works well with the rest of the movie  that guy on the bus starting to film and make commentaries was quite hilarious for instance the story? well it is a marvel special effects movie so one should not expect too much but the story is not bad  it mostly holds together and works well enough to tie all the action together  the acting is pretty much the same thing  one should not expect too much but it is good enough  it was nice to see michelle yeoh as ying nan though  she was one of the few cool characters in discovery and she does know how to act overall i very much enjoyed this movie  it is a simple super hero and fantasy adventure story with lots of action and special effects and with the single purpose of entertaining the audience that doesn't fall in the trap of trying to ""educate"" said audience ",Positive
154,"i got to admit i wasn't particularly blown away by anything in the movie   i might even say ""i was bored"" by it don't get me wrong   it is a spectacle! the action is great  the locations are nice  costume design  sound design  etc  but it is overall a soft release not worth seeing in theaters   specially as a follow up to what endgame was the biggest problem for me  is how the underwritten lead has muddled personality (for reasons covered in the story) devoid of charm  personality or good dialogue the next issue is the humor  which didn't land for me   not once  the supporting lead awkwafina isn't her normal ""loud"" self that's supposed to be funny every time she opens her mouth  her role is very supportive and a little dramatic  and while i questioned myself why was she even there for  it doesn't ultimately matter  she is another forgettable character that is given more importance than the role deserves finally  the third act is weak  there's a balancing problem with stakes  you can't feel tension or weight to any action  and there's a lot of superficial ""i can't do it"" until they can in the end  this feels like a very safe plot  written in a way to appeal to china (considering how the mandarin is portrayed)  that ends up appealing to no one specific  certainly doesn't feel like a marvel movie   but it was bound to happen if we are to be introduced to different aspects of the narrative  but it also doesn't feel like a comic book  it's more generic than that ",Positive
155,solid pop corn film  although the director tried not to look like a standard marvel movie  i think he only succeeded to some extent  the first half of the film was very good  the story  and especially the impressive fight scenes  however  later in the film we constantly get some new elements  the story expands  there is not always an explanation  and the worst part of the film was my last fight because i think they went too far with special effects  for me personally it was not watchable  the bad guys overall were just solid  nothing special  of course  at the end of the film we have a scene that shows us how to look for (at least) another film ,Positive
156,the entire cast was perfect  especially simu liu  awkwafina  tony leung  michelle yeoh  ben kingsley  and ronny chieng! : ) spectacular visual effects  and  awesome fight scenes! : ),Positive
157,a bold step for the mcu  incorporating an eastern cinema approach into it's franchise  with it's foundations built on choreography and humour  shang chi beautifully brings in elements of famed kung fu films and chinese culture the cast  perhaps largely unknown in most of the world  perform excellently and those performances are centred on the movements within the film  taking inspiration from many martial arts  the action scenes   whilst exaggerated and outlandish in comparison to the film's peers   are brilliant  the addition of kingsley is truly excellent too  as he and awkwafina provide the majority of laughs a standalone plot whilst maintaining links to the mcu  shangi chi creates a new platform for marvel to explore  although clearly sets up the next phase along with other releases from the year  the standout element is the creation of the new world and it's creatures though  a huge disney budget bringing to life fabled animals long deserving of a spotlight ,Positive
158,"shang chi and the legend of the ten rings
2021
12a
director: destin daniel cretton
starring: simu liu  awkwafina  ben kingsley  tony leung  meng'er zhang  fala chen  michelle yeoh  wah yeun  florian munteanu etcshang chi (simu liu) the master of unarmed weaponry based kung fu  is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the ten rings organisation  wow what a film shang chi was and one of the strongest additions to the mcu my first few positives would be the character background and set up  as well as the fantastic cinematography  worldbuilding and action  as well as the likeable characters and performances  i really liked that the film went into the character background for the mandarin and the mythology of the ten rings and how he got them  with an action packed and well explained opening sequence that set the tone for the film very well  offering something different from the mcu from the very first scene  i also thought the set up was strong  the film established shang chi and his life without his dad excellently  making you connect to the characters  but also did a great job at setting up the villain's intentions well and developing the plot nicely  the cinematography in this film had to be some of the most beautiful visuals i have seen from the mcu  there were so many beautifully shot scenes especially within the action scenes with mid or long shots where you could actually see what was happening  the colour grading and scope of the film was seriously impressive  i was in awe  i also thought the action was probably the strongest i have seen from the mcu  the action was incredibly choreographed  very entertaining  and incorporated asian culture and kung fu and they were so well shot it was one of the films strongest elements  the worldbuilding was also very strong  this film introduced us to such a rich and beautiful new world  it was beautiful and well explained and really explored in a lot of detail but left more to be explored for the future  this film was like seeing wakanda for the first time  the film had such likeable characters  particularly with shang chi and katy (awkwafina) all of the new characters introduced were instantly likeable and i connected with them quickly  this was also helped by the fantastic chemistry between the whole cast  everyone worked amazing together  especially simu liu and awkwafina who were both amazing here  and did amazing performances  they both had loads of charm and charisma  other cast standouts were tony leung  ben kingsley  michelle yeoh and menger zhang my next few positives would be the humour and sound design  the family dynamic and character depth  as well as the fun cameos and plot twists  the soundtrack for the film was also excellent  it gave the action scenes in particular an intense atmosphere and really elevated a lot of the scenes well  i really liked the family dynamic the film had  having the villain be shang chi's father and his mother and sister be involved was a great idea  it made the film more personal to the characters and increased the stakes for the characters  they had a connection and the conflict between the different members of the family was very well written  this gave characters like shang chi and the mandarin a lot more character depth  the mandarin was so crushed by his wife's death because she made him a good man  and his quest to find his wife really gave him some emotional depth  and shang chi's attempt to live a normal life and escape his father's shadow  but also look for his dads love and acceptance was really well handled  as well as his character decisions involving his sister and his regret over his mother gave his character a good amount of layers  the cameos in this film were a lot of fun  there was a few easter eggs sprinkled throughout but it still felt like its own film  but having wong back was a great surprise and that was in the trailer so not a spoiler  i also thought the plot twists were strong  the twists involving the family's secrets and the new world were well executed  unexpected and added some great layers to the film  it never once got boring i did have a few minor issues  the villain was underused going into the final act  there was a few issues with the creative decisions in the final act  and there was a slight overusage of flashbacks  i did find that the mandarin was taken out of a big chunk of the film in order to delay the final act and expand the story world more  it would have been nice for his character to be incorporated within the plot as a whole instead of being used for more flashbacks  i did find that there were too many flashbacks  a lot of them served the plot well and had purpose  but some of them felt unneeded and repetitive and were occasionally jarring  there were just a few creative decisions in the final act i wasn't fond of  there was some overusage of cgi that took me out of a couple of scenes  and there was a deux ex machina with katy that was slightly cheesy to me my final few positives would be the set pieces  great development to the plot and balance to the villain  as well as interesting elements  great dialogue  and a great final act  the films set locations were beautiful  they really captured the magic of the world as well as asian culture  the representation for the asian community in this film was excellent  the plot development was also excellent  the twists gave the film multiple layers to work with  and the different acts flowed well  with constant new elements being added to keep the film feeling fresh  i also thought the film did an excellent job at making the audience sympathise with the mandarin but also making it clear he was still the villain  as the film showed what kind of man he used to be with his wife i understood him wanting to be reunited with her  but the film excellently balanced this with his cruel and controlling behaviour to make him one of the strongest villains i have seen in a while in the mcu  i also thought there was a lot of interesting elements to the story world  the world of ta lo was fascinating  and the film went into great detail of the culture and the lives of the people living there which was fascinating  the dialogue was also great  raising great themes of acceptance  family and grief that was excellently told through the lines of dialogue that felt personal to the characters and were very well written  the final act was also amazing  they went all out with the visuals and action  in a thrilling  exciting and breath taking final act that conclude the story and the character arcs excellently and setting up chang chi's future in the mcu very well overall  shang chi has a few structure issues and falls into some mcu tropes with the cgi in the final act  but this film was visually stunning  with some of the best worldbuilding and action from the mcu  with star making performances from simu liu and awkwafina  also  with amazing asian representation  this has really taken the mcu in a different direction and is one of their strongest origin stories overall rating 92/100 ",Positive
159,after being burned by mulan last year  i went into this film with very low expectations  but was delighted to find this movie was wonderful to watch  tony leung  as the misguided villain trying to resurrect his wife and shaun's mother  is the breakout star here  and his storyline   along with leung's acting   is so magnificent that it sort of overshadows the other characters  including shaun  this film is exciting  yet also heartwarming ,Positive
160,too unrealistic movie  with too much special effect that they do not bother to cover up  humoristic moments do not seem that funny  also  how a thin someone holdoff a big guy?ugh  it is that classic moves of hollywood and phrases  like the headphone did not hear you  or foreigner moving oversea  suddenly it looks like how they are picturing america especially in the cab  like your pants joke  hell no phrase when looking at height  or was looking everywhere for you  burn it down  classic moves like using multiple people as a stair hate it also that sometimes they just speak english but mostly chinese  wondering what they want how much did the chinese pay disney?using big actors and adding a new guy in to keep the quality of the acting  with a bad script it does not do well  especially when there is no innovative action in the players  they were copy and paste from another movie they played before classic scenarios making it so predictable  and fights that could not be won due to lack of experience are own suddenly acting is below average  quality of screen is high but too much special effect  camera work is ok because it has gotten took over multiple of times by special effects so can not give any real points  sound is below average because they're using too much overused kinds 1 time only movie  points are given to the cast because they still try to make something out of it but still not pulling tit off and meeting the script only  some points for the innovativeness idea ,Positive
161,when shang chi was announced in phase 4  i got excited because i am a fan of martial arts films  but after the pandemic  i slowly started losing interest in the film because i felt that mcu won't be as good after endgame and my fear turned true with the post endgame movies  none of the films or series satisfied me  i saw shang chi with low expectations and got fully satisfied what i loved about shang chi the most was its entertaining  post endgame  mcu got burdened with expectations to connect their films into a universe  set up future films and do something different but in that process forgot to provide entertainment  on the other hand  shang chi is not burdened with any of these and tells a simple and independent story  there is no deliberate connecting to the mcu  nor they are in a hurry to set up any sequels  also its not anything different as its a typical chinese martial arts mythological film  the action scenes in train and skyscraper were mindblowing and best hand to hand action scenes after winter soldier(which black widow failed to provide)  the female stars were also badass  the climax cgi action was okay only drawback is there is nothing new in the plot as its that typical mcu storyline where our hero has daddy issues on the whole  shang chi and the legend of ten rings is a very good standalone mcu film after thor ragnarok ,Positive
162,judging by the level of other marvel movies this was definitely a miss there is no humour  no sense of fun  it feels like a generic kung fu movie and that we have seen it all before   i saw the ending way before we got there and above all  it was boring awkwafina was intensely annoying as ever with her grating personality and spouting exposition all the time marvel are really missing the mark with a lot of their latest offerings  just phoning it in like with star wars movies ,Negative
163,this stand alone marvel cinematic universe origin story is a beautiful ode to asian martial arts films (awkwafina is so comical and adorable as the hero's sidekick that she can only be matched by a hilarious kingsley) ,Positive
164,"marvel has not done much good lately  2 horrible tv shows  and 1 bad tv show  not a single good movie since captain marvel  and nothing seemingly good coming over the horizon to be honest i have started to give up  marvel have produced magnificent movies and great entertainment for many years  but lately it is like that magic has come off and they seem much more run of the mill basic with that  by now  boring marvel feel  marvel has tried to introduce more political correctness  more feminism  and more nonsense diversity  and it has all failed this movie however is not a failure why?this movie is simple  it is to the point  it follows tropes  cliches  and it is a classic heroes journey   which is exactly why it works!marvel took a classical story we all heard  read and seen before but they switched a few things around  kept some of that marvel feel  and made it play out mainly in china and almost only with chinese actors  and it works!imagine that? sure you can find some political nonsense if you look hard enough  but who cares when you have great fight scenes  lovely sceneries  a great (but basic) story and brilliant well written characters we even get a villain that you understand  sympathise with and even feel a sting of ""ah  too bad"" about him this is how you make an action movie! great stuff marvel!the points i deduct is due to the movie not being that amazing  they pull the heroes journey of sure  but we have also seen it done better  sound is great  but not amazing  directing is great  but not amazing  etc  etc  everything about this movie is high class  greatly done  and well performed  but it is not on top  it is not amazing nor perfect i also have a few objections about the background story and the ending  but i am keeping this spoiler free so   8/10  this is a great movie and highly entertaining  and definitely worth the ticket price  go see and get your faith in marvel restored ",Positive
165,shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is one of the marvel's first phase 4 movies  in hindsight it has a underlying tone and story similar to that of black panther  both being representations of certain groups and and their cultures the story is solid  it wasn't perfect as it had some minor flaws  a bit cheesy with good writing and comedy but nothing exceptional  the fight scenes   the choreography and dragons were cool which were refreshing compared to the last couple of mcu movies that were released  the characters are nothing to interesting other than shang chi and his dad and their whole dynamic overall an enjoyable film  an eyecandy with some flaws but nonetheless was watchable and likable memorable: no rewatchable: unlikely  ,Positive
166,shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is a new superhero movie in the marvel film series  the film is directed and written in part by destin daniel cretton  the director of short term 12 and just mercy the film is about shaun (simu liu)  who tries to put his past behind him and just wants to enjoy his life with his best friend katy (awkwafina)  when the mysterious organization the ten rings finds shaun  he is forced to confront his past after all  to do this  he must take his birth name shang chi again  to protect katy and his sister xialing (meng'er zhang) from the actions of the ten rings and their leader xu wenwu the mandarin (tony chiu wai leung) who is also shaun  his father this film is marvel's first superhero film starring an asian actor  furthermore  with this film they also bring out the asian culture and fighting styles well  for this they have used other movies like crouching tiger  hidden dragon as an example  fans of this film can recognize moments that refer back to these films  they portray the fight scenes where characters fight each other with asian fighting styles well and entertainingly  the art of the asian fighting style is somewhat overshadowed when characters use more supernatural powers in the film  fight scenes where this happens are less exciting and entertaining than scenes where characters fight each other in more normal ways at one point  the film also feels like you're watching a live action mix of the asian animation shows pokémon and avatar: the last airbender  these scenes provide some extra comedy and are especially more entertaining for younger viewers  the movies and costumes of the film cast also help with the emergence of asian culture in the film  the visual effects are also put to good use in the film  except for a few scenes  it can be seen that they have used a green screen for the background  but fortunately this is not disturbing in the film  creatures can also be returned before the start of the film  a bit redundant on a few action scenes with 3d effects in the film the acting is well done by the film cast  simu liu took to twitter to ask marvel to play the part  with both parties quickly making a good deal  simu liu comes across as good and charismatic as the lead of the film and further conveys the action sequences beautifully  along with awkwafina  he also has good chemistry in the film and together provide good appropriate humor  the comedy also doesn't overshadow all the dramatic aspects in the film  which sometimes does happen  tony chiu wai leung also portrays the villain of the film in a good and sympathetic way  so that as a viewer you understand why he does what he is doing to me  this film is also only his first english language role in an american film  although this is only his first time  he still delivers good and appropriate acting  meng'er zhang does not get that much time in the film  but a bit less good or present in the film ,Positive
167,this was so bad   i'm honestly shocked on how lazy the writing is i really am  this was probably the worst movie i've seen in a long time wow  no hate on the actors or even some fight scenes but this was sooooooooo bad ,neutral
168,"when the movie first started    i felt like i was watching a ""foreign"" film  no english just chinese with english subtitle? didn't know what to expect in this movie  then later on  the casts started speaking english & the awesome fighting scenes kicked in  omg!! how exciting~ the fighting choreography was unbelievable  just as good as jackie chan movies!the storyline was alright but the cg was very good  they used lots of chinese culture tradition  costume & symbols  looking forward to see the next sequel ",Positive
169,i thought this film was a good break from the usual marvel super hero films  it was much more traditional martial arts film combined with some modern aspects the concept was good and the film went along at a great pace  there was some good humour as well i would really recommend it ,Positive
170,marvel's latest feature introduces cinephiles to shaun aka shang chi (simu liu) a martial arts master and a character created by steve englehart and jim starlin  first appearing in a marvel publication back in 1973  beginning in the first of many gorgeously choreographed and shot sequences  we're introduced to shang chi's father xu wenwu (tony chiu wai leung) and mother li (fala chen) also entailing the awesome power of the ten rings which xu currently has in his possession  what follows is a heart pounding and ridiculously entertaining adventure movie with true heart filled with beautiful performances not least from everyone already mentioned and including awkwafina as shaun's best friends katy and meng'er zhang as sister xialing  there's plenty here to adore on screen not even getting to the truly awe inspiring action set pieces with the best fight scenes i've seen in recent memory  cretton (short term 12  just mercy) is very quickly becoming one of my favourite directors having produced three incredible pieces of cinema in the last 8 years  it's great to see that his passion for storytelling and independent spirit still shines through his latest here while also staying true to the marvel fan base (i really did not expect a certain character to show up but made for some really comical moments) the visual effects are of course stunning but what makes them stand out here are how they're incorporated with the beautiful landscapes to enhance the feeling of authentically experiencing shaun's heritage and getting wrapped up in the culture that the filmmakers so wonderfully explore  this is how origin stories should be made! the creature design is also incredible and is an integral element to making the final sequences all the more breathtaking please do yourselves a favour and see this on the biggest screens possible  please support your local cinema and stay safe my friends ,Positive
171,"one again the studio brings jokes and the dazzling visuals over a good character development  after one hour  you don't care for the characters  dysfunctional drama in the family and the chosen one   we have seen this a million times this is the first time i felt sleepy for an action movie  i feel like i wasted my money  despite availing the super tuesday offer  the suicide squad was far much better in terms of storyboard over rated  like black panther
what's next   shang chi: origins?",Positive
172,'shang chi & the legend of the ten rings' (or scltr?) feels like the proper start of mcu's phase 4  with a clear link forming to 'doctor strange in the multiverse of madness'  we're first introduced to what seems like a chinese fairytale  as we follow wenwu (leung) and his millennium of power with 10 enchanted rings/bracelets  we then meet li (chen)  who turns out to be the mum of shang chi (liu) & xialing (zhang) how the mystical realm of ta lo fits in and it's secrets aren't revealed until the third act  and after the intro  the film does well to show shang chi & katy (awkwafina) living their somewhat unfulfilled lives in san francisco  before the action starts to heat up when shang chi goes looking for his sister  all the actors are very likeable  especially leung  who does a great job of making sure wenwu doesn't descend into a caricature of a bad guy  but truly feels like a misguided father  some great cameos also round everything out and it's always great to see michelle yeoh while a bit slow in some parts  the martial arts scenes and action near the end are great  without being overwhelming   certainly up there with 'hero' & 'crouching tiger  hidden dragon'  also a nice nod to 'raya & the last dragon'! nice ending and character arc for shang chi   i look forward to seeing him find his place in the mcu ,Positive
173,that's how a new superhero is introduced in a big universe  shang chi and the legend of ten rings featured a perfect casting & screenplay  it's really great to see hand to hand combat fight sequences after a very long time in mcu  action choreographers and the director did a great job though it had a predictable plot just like other disney films  due to its brilliant execution you'll be glued to the screen  awkwafina as katy was my favourite character of the film as all the comedy punches were delivered through her character finally  shang chi and the legend of ten rings is a complete action packed mcu film available on disney+ hotstar © mandalbros ,Positive
174,seamlessly combined modern martial arts fantasy and asian mythology without cringe/dull moments made it a different kind of mcu movies to entertain international audience mind few (back and forth) narrative problems  destin daniel cretton successfully put humor and heart in right time and places thanks to scintillating cast who lit up the screen especially charismatic tony leung chemistry between simu & awkwafina as besties are undeniably good action scenes including cgi works definitely made some nice highlights going to watch it over and over again  imax gave better experience for sure 😁,Positive
175,"it's good  but not great disney was trying to market this as an asian american flick made by and for asian americans  which really never bodes well  when a movie caters to a specific race like this it's usually produced not directed  it usually just uses cheap race pointed gimmicks and tropes  but the reviews for this movie have been really good  so i didn't quite know what to expect  after endgame and black widow and i really thought marvel had lost it  black panther was just okay  this surpasses all the 3 movies and returns marvel to a greater level again  it does remind me of captain marvel  not nearly as good  but similar quality and structure to it with similar problems we have a male lead  shang  a dry actor who lacks the charisma needed for the role  but he is just fine  then he has a female friend who is the star of the show when she is on screen with him  she is just funny and cute  her humor is a bit forced and weird here  but she knows humor and makes it work  there are some scenes where it's too much though  shang then has a sister who yet again is more charming than him  but not by much  she has that extra bit of charisma with a cool hair style while shang is a handsome  happy  satisfied young person  there is no personal suffering or emotions behind his eyes  he acts out scenes and moves on  it's not a deep character like batman  rather this is the old comic book superman  just a force with no pain  he beats up people and moves on the dad is amazing! he basically makes the movie  he totally steals his scenes and his acting is spotless  you really have to see him to understand just what he delivers on screen as the antagonist  even the romanian with one hand is way better on screen than the protagonist  basically everyone else has more charisma than the lead the main issue here is the lack of clear plot focus of a good guy fighting evil  the dad tries to rescue an evil force he thinks is his dead wife  so he sends assassins after his son to get an amulet from him and to call him back  same with his daughter  so the first hour of the movie is just fight after fight where the protagonist barely survives until we learn that the assassins are actually just there to greet them  so all of that was for nothing? yep  no one was supposed to die  the dad just wanted to contact his kids  so where is the bad guy even?the fights are cool enough  but we don't understand why they happen and when we learn why they happened it's a huge letdown  the choreography and cgi is good though  the chinese mythology here is amazing  there are a lot of real myth animals and old chinese art  they even speak chinese for much of the movie which is extra great  it just works to make it feel rich and interesting  it's all true to real myths and real national history  things communist china once tried to burn and destroy to replace it with a new system  so they are recreating a lost world and culture in cgi  unfortunately the ""bad guy"" never appears  the dad is sorta  kinda bad at times  the son fights his dad without magic while the dad is using magic  yet they are equally powerful  so it's not clear what there is at stake? it's clear that the good guys can beat up even magical beings with their skills alone  once they get magical power and extra weapons it's too easy  you don't feel like it's finally fair  you feel like it was already too easy and now it's extremely easy  at one point the evil forces are released by the dad  but even that fight is very one sided  it's too many good guys and they are way too powerful  the dad is a powerful character  but he never really feels dangerous this reminds me of captain marvel and captain marvel in endgame  or the modern spiderman with a billion electronic tools to save his ass all the time  it's just not fun to see a protagonist trained as a killer easily kill everyone  there is nothing at play  no one loses anything  nothing is really in any danger  you need a weak character fighting greater forces  a character who has an inner need to prove himself  the movie lacks thematic soul  while the mythology and chinese art give it another type of artistic soul  it's just not enough to really make it work  it needed both things  so while it totally rests on one element and works as a fun watch it still feels empty overall  i want to rewatch captain marvel  it's at least fun and has some clear plot and deep characters even though captain marvel is never in danger of losing  here there is less personality and fewer grounded characters as everything is magical  it's a wish fulfillment movie all the way  we don't even see people getting hurt as all that is off screen  so characters are killed without us seeing the actual death  it's all very  very tame to a level marvel has never done before  a proper disney movie  i totally would get it if some people wouldn't like the movie  same with black panther  it feels too simple and shallow  but this is 10 times better than black widow and other such huge duds  i still have no want to watch a sequel  shang will just be even stronger    what's the point? i don't want to watch another captain marvel movie either as such unless they do something really creative  or black panther  you need to tone down their powers  but this one is fully dead in the water as it just feels shallow all the way  at least we got the magical world  but i have already seen it  so i don't want to see it again  i want to experience a plot and feel the struggle  without a struggle there is nothing deeper to explore  but at least marvel shows that they still care about cgi so there is always something to enjoy in these movies ",Positive

177,yes  it is not bad at all  at least way better then that black widow episode and simu liu is pretty good with his skills and all quiet entertaining and the plot match well with the avengers  dont know why but still was expecting iron man to show up in some part nevertheless  good one from the makers and a good watch surely ,Positive
178,marvel delivers  after various movies that could've made even hardcore fans feel over saturated  shang chi sets itself apart by blurring the line between hero and villain  not focussing on good vs evil or origin stories  it focusses mainly on the development of various lead characters who never become less than 3 dimensional  and so this movie achieves what black panther unsuccessfully tried to be the only critical issue is that this movie has awkwafina  so you know you'll have to suffer through some pointless yelling which seems to be intented as funny  but never really is ,neutral
179,as with all marvel movies  the ending tries so hard to be enormous that it becomes visually impossible to comprehend  i would like it if just one of these superhero movies had a character think and talk their way out of a threat to humanity  nevertheless  this is one of the better attempts    primarily because it is a well acted origin story with a minimal amount of heart and soul  be thankful for small mercies!,Negative
180,the much awaited shangi chi and the legend of the ten rings released today in theatres  it follows the journey of shang chi (simu liu)  the son of the famed mcu villain the mandarin  who revolts against his father to fight evil the first stand alone film featuring an asian american superhero  shang chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences  all the actors and especially simu liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows  with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in san francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in macau  the standouts awkwafina and a surprise returning character from the mcu provide genuine  sarcasm laced comedy that adds another wonderful layer to the experience  cameos from benedict wong and ronnie chieng also manage to leave the audience in spits without stooping to cultural appropriation  with an all asian crew  director destin daniel cretton pays rich tribute to chinese heritage at every turn  hong kong's superstars tony leung and michelle yeoh are electric in their roles and the fact that they don't seem to have lost a step with age  acing their action sequences  shows their dedication as performers regarded as one of the finest actor's chinese cinema has every produced  tony leung stamps his class all over the film  giving an engrossing  captivating performance as the dreaded leader of the ten rings his inner moral dilemmas and love/hate relationship with his children are portrayed brilliantly by the man nicknamed 'small tiger' among the five tiger generals of hong kong cinemathe flashback sequences help to build up shang chi as a character and intricately captures his upbringing as the heir apparent to a genocidal megalomaniac  and how despite wanting nothing to do with his father's murderous tendencies  as his son  he is inadvertently drawn to the mandarin's world of violence and carnage the films delves into mystical elements towards the climax and with two surprise laden post credit sequences tie into both doctor strange's world of mystic arts as well as a possible connection that the ten rings has to alien technology as always  the way weaves in each individual fim character to the wonderful tapestry that makes up each of its phases is a joy in itself it is due to the well written characters and the nuanced acting of its performers that shang chi stands out while the eye catching cgi and elaborately chorographer action sequences add more gloss to the end product another wonderful new addition to the mcu world and hopefully this paves the way for more ethnicities being represented in the universe as time goes on highly recommended  a must watch  marvel's phase 4 continues to raise the bar!,Positive
181,let's agree that it is a bad movie from multiple points of view  it depends a lot on the visual effects  its main characters can be funny but not nice  the story does not generate much interest and we have seen the fights many times and in a better way in almost any film produced in hong kong  indonesia or thailand of the last twenty years  the only thing that saves this film is the karaoke scene that is unexpectedly welcome  the rest is routine  mediocre  tiring and bland ,Positive
182,another addition to the mcu  which is becoming more and more sci fi every movie  this movie is the asian one  taking inspiration from chinese mythology and kung fu in this action adventure  great fight scenes and chases expertly shot  the downside is that most of it looks entirely computer generated  the comedian i don't like made me disappointed again  but once the 2nd comedic side kick joined it was a lot more funny  strong start  middling middle and an ending which lacked motivation  if only it didn't get dragged into asian wakanda ,Positive
183,good entertaining and bollywood like  it is loaded with action  preferably watch on the biggest screen available marvel's spider man: into the spider verse is much more than the trailer/teaser revealed! first ten minutes or so or so in chinese! and throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well   throughout! that gives it a touch of authenticity  how immigrants in america or anywhere else in the world grew up i think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation of asian characters  especially nowadays with anti asian hate/crime rising  the film had a pure theatrical release  instead of the black widow treatment (which also was available on disney plus and the cinemas at the same time) the movie does not have that as a topic  it is entertainment after all  but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned  now waiting for the other stuff to drop  especially after the mid credit scene  that is such a tease!,Positive
184,shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is one of the biggest mcu film ever made  with loads of action  kung fu  and lots of fun  simi liu has nailed the new superhero character  the choreography was brilliant  the vfx was pretty well done  and the cast and crew did such an amazing job making this movie happen  i hope we get to see shang chi once again  maybe in the new avengers or the sequel if they make that happen in the future of the mcu  will just never know ,Positive
185,i'm sorry but the leading man here is a definite miscast  or is it because tony leung and awkwfina stole the show? hmmmmmm      while the mcu movies are getting too formulaic i'm hesitant to say the next 10 year is starting out rather uninteresting  shang chi is basically a chinese cash grab in the lineage of black panther  it is uninspiring  routine and cgi oriented back to casting the main lead  i'm suggesting either john cho (star trek  cowboy bobep ) or chang chen (dune) would be an upgrade  while falan chen is sufficient the role is a thankless one  as to the story i would love to see more of grandma and take out ben kingsley's i mean hawkeye series is better  if how so ever slightly  i understand the fantastic elements are tributes to the chinese culture  of course kingsley and that strange pet is trying hard to be comedic but is rather forced  overall it's a surface scratcher only  so disappointed ,Negative
186,it's good action movie  firstly  the scenario is pretty good  but it has nothing special  it's a little bit predictable  secondly  the cast is awesome  i really like akwafina in her role  she is very funny  also i like simu lu as main character he is charismatic person  but my favourite is one character from past film of mcu (don't want to give spoiler)  thirdly  i like how the atmosphere of ancient chinese culture was shown  but for me i want more  fourthly  the fighting is good too so  it's nice mcu film ,Positive
187,this was a case of 3rd time lucky for me; as i was totally disappointed with the dismal  'ghost in the shell' and the utterly abysmal 'snake eyes' rubbish  every single actor/actress/character played their roles to perfection and everything was in balance throughout i e  comedy timing  amount of cgi and an excellent script  my favourite chinese lady actress (of whose films i have seen nearly all)  michelle yeoh  is her usual perfect self everything that is good about the film has already been commented upon in most of the other reviews here so  all there is left to say is that its a great film for family  eastern fantasy and the toy that all the kids are going to beg parents for as a christmas present (i won't say a name etc but when you get to the ben kingsley appearance part of the film  you will know of what i'm talking of) top notch film and best of the mcu (marvel cinematic universe) to date   after 'avengers: endgame (2019) of course ,Positive
188,"thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie  not one bit is boring and the comedy is really good and appropriate and not cringey like some other marvel movies this is not an ""8"" 8 for me  but it's not a 7 either  more like 7 6 but then again  imdb doesn't have half stars for some reasons the fight choreography is amazing and this one has some of the best hand to hand action in marvel  it kinda gets ridiculous in the end and you feel like it's not in the mcu  but mcu is already ridiculous so this is not that far fetched the acting of all of them was good especially the father the ""villain"" is really relatable and well written  even though i felt like we needed more time with him  this much is enough to make you actually feel and understand why he does what he does and is kinda not the bad guy the story and characters could've used some more fleshing out  especially shaun's sister story and characters might be cliché but they use those clichés well and make you care about these characters and that's the most important part  i just wish there was more showing and not telling the cgi was not that good and it's really noticeable especially at the end  they should've worked on it more and polished it not using gore and cuss words because they want their movies to be pg 13 really hurts these movies  even though they can use at least one f word but for some reason they don't  i'm not saying that f word can make the movie better  but sometimes you need something more than ""dam"" for the scene to be more impactful  also  doesn't actually showing most of the flashbacks make them more impactful? why does the camera turn away from the ""death"" scenes that can make the movie better? this is why not showing a little bit of blood and gore hurts these movies  these movies keep pulling their punches back  and believe me no one cares if you used some more gruesome scenes  how are you gonna make a deadpool 3 and blade movie then?all in all  very enjoyable movie with good martial arts fights  characters  music choice  and a decent story  i might like it better when i see it a second time  but right now i'm kinda lukewarm about it  really looking forward to seeing more of what shang chi's gonna do in the mcu ",Positive
189,"marvel routine format  nothing special  there are many chinese elements  many chinese dialogues  good special effects  and some understanding of chinese philosophy  it is a very good job in the european and american popcorn market  the founder wants to use ""mother tongue chinese"" in some key emotional processing  and in some rational or background explanations  ""english"" is used as much as possible to let the target audience understand the whole world view as soon as possible  and many trade offs and efforts have been made  of course  if you are looking forward to a deep understanding of chinese culture  then you may be disappointed; but if  like me  you just hope not to be those stereotypes forever  you will see a lot of intention to go in the right direction ",Positive
190,"feminism at its best from the start  
he has got to go but the useless friend insert herself into the trip and do not take no for an answer and he needs to explain himself and prove his worth to her   yadayada
and his sister   of course she needed to knock him out   and what did he say to the american chinese girl   she was not allowed to train but he watched and learned how to do it better     oh ok then  that totally happens alright   but always with female characters    did we see something like his in black widow or ms marvel? nah  in these movies only women are allowed to be empowered  they get to the forbidden city    the usually female friend becomes a natural sharpshooter with her bow    and the sister just needs her chain knife throwing thing and encouragement from her aunt and she is ready   while the guy gets beaten up by his aunt learning how to fight wind leaf style   and he looks like a beginner even tho he has trained since he was a little boy the story was alright   thank god at least he got to slay the big bad monster   i thought his sister was going to do it even tho he is the main character  anyway  first post credit scene was ok   not sure why the female friend was there   she does not have any supernatural artifacts   i guess she will be comic relief but more importantly plot armor and the fact she is a woman and cannot die average movie ",Positive
191,i watched the first iron man  spider man  ant man  avenger movies many times  they are superbe  for a few years now the mcu movies are just a drag (apart from captain marvel)  same here  looking visually stunning with top notch cgi  beautiful fight balets  amazing artwork  but boring as hell  and could marvel please stop dragging in stars from other mcu movies? no idea what wong was doing in this ,Positive
192,let me commence by saying this movie is by far one of the most fun  action packed marvel movies ever!simu liu is the perfect marvel protagonist  and awkwafina delivers the obligatory yet welcomed dose of humor you'd come to expect from a marvel presentation but beyond that this movie is rich with mythology  adventure  and incredible martial arts combat that cannot be described with another phrase other than breathtaking  to be the introduction of a new character the story is well written and you feel as if he had been with us from the start i give this move the 10 it deserves  in marvel we trust ,Positive
193,a very welcomed addition to the mcu  and any avengers to come  'shang chi' kung fu's it's way to top tier mcu territory  especially when it comes to origin stories perhaps this generations 'crouching tiger  hidden dragon'  both of which are visual spectacles to behold  'shang chi' is full of beautiful creatures  costumes  martial arts  and acting  probably the best fighting in the mcu  which makes sense (though cap and winter soldier fighting is my personal favourite)  the real mandarin makes his debut and does not disappoint  tony chiu wai leung was fantastic  all the other cast members were very likable as well  a few appearances from other mcu characters  including a surprising one that somewhat redeems himself a refreshing marvel superhero movie in that it primarily focuses on itself  but has tons of potential to jump right in with other marvel storylines  the mcu still holds lots of excitement for the future with characters like shang chi ,Positive
194,"wow was this fun  charismatic simu hits a home run/touchdown with this movie  even akwafina becomes likable by the halfway point and that's saying a lot  unlike recent martial arts movies like black widow or snake eyes you actually see the punches and kicks  even the wire fu looks elegant instead of ridiculous  something very few movies have pulled off  funny  fun and never boring despite quite a bit of exposition and the final cgi extravaganza battle is a sight to behold  fantastic battle between the chineese dragon and the malevolent creature  after seeing 5 disappointing back to back superhero movies:
far from home
harley quinn
ww2
black widow
suicide squad
they finally made one that's better than all those put together  don't get me started on the utter trash that joker was  finally one worth seeing  hats off to all involved ",Positive
195,"what do you get when you have no idea what you are creating beyond ""rip off successful cantonese han movies  so that the mouse can sell the product to flu bear""?well  now we know  a painfully spavined production that begs flu bear to approve it right from the first subtitled moment with excruciatingly ""mandarin"" performances that even a barely trained white ear can detect as being more californian than chongqing then the movie proper starts  and we're inflicted with nora lum  who has built her career on appropriating and exploiting blackness  wow  nora lum  in the current year granted  the mandarin empire loathes black people even more than nora lum does  but it's still startling to see her not only accepted but showcased oh  the movie?eh  who cares? it's all ropey cgi  overblown score  infantile plot  cringe dialogue  and a truly tragic performance by michelle yeo who i wish had had the integrity to turn down this opportunity final context: i wept three times during crouching tiger  hidden dragon: once in joy  once in sadness  once in astonishment i wept once during this    thing    in despair  then i bailed  hard it's not ok to pander to winnie the flu  it's not ok ",Negative
196,i heard great things on the internet about this movie  so i had some pretty high expectations  well  i was let down  and judging by the other reviews alot of other people were too  people are not going to put up with this crap for too much longer  i mean how many bad movies can disney make in a row and expect people to continue to watch them?i see disney even tried to even throw some anti american talk into this movie to try to get on china's good side    but even that did not work  china did not allow their citizens to watch it  i guess disney will have to put even more anti american talk into the next movie you messed up star wars disney  now you are messing up every marvel movie  maybe wokeness is not the way to go  please can someone buy marvel from disney before its too late??3/10 another very poor disney marvel movie ,Positive
197,this is by far the most nonsensical plot in a marvel film and one of the worst stories i've ever witnessed  it's so hard to make sense of anything at all in this film  the only good thing is some of the action sequences  bus fight is spectacular but after that it goes completely downhill cause only after that does the plot actually unfold  and it is so ridiculous and so full of nonsense that i was thoroughly bored whenever anything other than the fight scenes were on i think marvel is done  this phase seems completely relying on the success of the previous one  the only good thing is spider man and i'm eagerly looking forward to no way home  after this i don't have any expectations from marvel films other than spider man the humour in this movie is pure cringe  it feels too forced and awkwafina is completely out of place  the last scene where they sing hotel california is so damn cringy  it's a tragedy that they thought people would enjoy it  this is a really bad film minus the action sequences  watch it only for the action which looks good on the big screen  don't have even the slightest expectation from the story ,Positive
198,let me preface this by saying that my enjoyment of the movie may have been dampered by a poor night's sleep  that being said  the middle 45 minutes of this film had me nearly falling asleep  literally  the character development just couldn't hook me at all because it felt like they kept revisiting the same points on a positive note  the visuals and martial arts are absolutely spectacular  the first act of the film contains most of the martial arts and it is so crisp and well choreographed  the final act flexes all of the cgi dollas and they make they already big budget stretch far  with some of the more impressive sights you will see in a marvel movie so far  this movie didn't quite hit the 8/10 for me to recommend people see it in theatres  but lets tack that up to me being tired and you go see it anyway!,Positive
199,i watch all of marvel movie  idk its because the color or the theme set  but this movie cgi seems pretty to u know? i mean  this is phase 4 right? look at that mystical creatures  morris is the smooth of them all the fight indeed seems pretty fresh  it was good  it's also a good story with good script  a great portion of funny dialog its a beginning of the new phase right? lets give it a chance  overall its a good movie ,Positive
200,simple as that  it's worth watching  luckily i had subtitles on for the chinese speaking parts  and that helped  especially at the start of the movie (about 10 minutes)  don't forget the end credit scene at 2:01:46 ,Positive
201,like many  i was concerned that this new marvel cinematic universe saga would have trouble living up to previous standards but shang chi has already left me hopeful for the series' future  i literally know nothing about this character but i found his film debut to be a solid superhero adventure; well acted  effectively character driven  occasionally funny  rich with cultural representation and booming with swift and stylized martial arts action  it has what i hoped i was going to get from black panther: inclusivity and an interesting world and narrative  i'm 100% all for representation but the story and characters must be pronounced  too and i just found this entry to be a lot more distinguished and captivating although shang chi treads the familiar origin story formula  there's a few fresh twists and turns that uniquely sets this character's journey apart from the others  though the first half is decently entertaining with some identifiable drama and fast paced yet slightly derivative set pieces in urban environments  the second half is where the film really turns on (at least for me)  the chinese philosophy kicks in  the mythology is abundant  there's tons of visually striking imagery  a fantastical setting  loads of insane action choreography  the asian representation is just off the chain and i was so enraptured by it  it doesn't feel contrived  i sensed a great deal of respect for it and all the while an engaging story was unfolding  a nice balance  i was very satisfied with what i saw  i'm really looking forward to seeing more of shang chi's world and how it'll tie in with other stories yet to come  very cool movie  soulful  cultural and action packed ,Positive
202,nice mixture of marvel universe and eastasian movie art  great fight scenes and special effects lovable characters and a good story  and the dragon was just cool ,Positive
203,"shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is a mid tier entry in the marvel cinematic universe  the action choreography was gorgeous and the score set a powerful tone  unfortunately  the protagonist lacked charm and his persona was split rather than conflicted  what he lacked in personality  awkwafina more than made up for (sometimes to a a fault)  the other characters were fine but forgettable  with the exception of wenwu  who was the best part of the film my main complaint with shang chi is in the climactic third act  introducing and destroying a villainous beast in the final 20 minutes is never a good idea  the dragon ""dweller in darkness"" felt unnecessary and distracted from the true conflict between father and son this film is saved by the phenomenal action sequences  especially on the bus and outside the building in macao  shang chi and the legend of the ten rings left me excited for the next phase in the mcu from a production standpoint  but wary about the characters ",Positive
204,this movie was great  it was entertaining  it was fast paced  and it was unique  there were so many things i liked about this film  first off  i loved all the characters  such as shang chi  katy  xu wenwu  xialing  razor fist  death dealer  the return of trevor slattery  morris  and of course master guang bo  the actors for all these characters were also perfect  they suited their roles perfectly  in my opinion  this movie had some of the best supporting characters in the mcu  i also loved the action  it was absolutely amazing  there were some points in the movie where i felt like i was watching a martial arts movie  the stunts and the choreography were perfect  i couldn't have asked for anything more  the effects in this movie were also stunning  the moving forest  the mythical creatures (especially the dragon)  and the effects used on the ten rings were super cool  the effects in this movie were some of the best in the mcu  lastly  i also loved the plot  it just sat really well with me this movie was like nothing we have ever seen before in the mcu  it was very unique and a nice twist for marvel  the first credit scene was also very interesting and might have set up phase 4 in the mcu  this was a great movie  and i definitely recommend going to see it  even if you aren't a marvel fan ,Positive
205,ok  so i really liked it  in particular i really liked the characters  i loved the hero's journey that shang chi went on  i loved his relationship with katy and his sister  they were all likable  and badass in their own way  and you could empathize with them  i thought this was a very strong villain  not just physically  but very compelling  a lot of mcu villains can come across as very one note  but he was complex and layered  so that was great to see  and of course they were all strongly acted as well  akwafina is maybe the least strongest out of the main cast (check out the farewell if you really want to see her shine) but like  she is still is good in this i loved the fight choreography in this  probably some of the best fight scenes you get in the mcu  and i loved the visuals used in those scenes as well  some shots were truly stunning to watch one downside i had though is that i wanted to know more about how the magic works  like the final battle between shang chi and his father he has suddenly mastered his mother's magic/fighting  and i know the movie kind of pokes fun of this at the end by having shang chi tell his friends that he had 1 day of training  but seriously  how did that happen? is it just because he's his mother's son? is it because he was specifically in that place? i just needed a little more backstory/explanation  also  the wong/abomination fight (which was totally spoiled in the trailers) didnt really do anything and just added more questions  i guess they needed a way to set up wong for the mid credits scene though  and that mid credits scene in general just raised more questions for me  like why is bruce back to being in his human form? it clearly takes place after the events of endgame (judging by his arm sling) so why is he not in his professor hulk form?i thought the comedy was good for the most part  i think it worked well with the beginning and ending of the film  but didnt always land during the more meatier parts of the film  theres maybe a few other elements i could nitpick but for the most part i really liked this film  im not sure where i would rank it yet  i think probably a top 10 er ,Positive
206,i was excited for shang chi  infinity war and endgame set the bar very high at the end of phase 3  the mcu shows have been a mixed bag but shang chi seemed exciting because the director has a decent track record and i hadn't heard of the character  i thought it would be a good way for the mcu to expand but this is one of the most by the numbers superhero movies i've ever seen  practically everything about it falls flat or feels superficial  the humour is obvious and lazy  the fighting is cool but the camera is too hyperactive to let me properly enjoy it  the cgi is over used and seldom feels remotely convincing nor interesting although there's some backstory  it's boring and confusing  it's one thing to be told what happened in the past  it's much better if we understand why choices were made and feel the passage of time as it is  i didn't relate to any of the characters much at all  shaun and katy are just annoying and frivolous  the villain is stubborn and not particularly intimidating  i probably liked kingsley more than anyone else and his character could easily be removed without affecting the plot the staging is incredibly artificial  so many shots contain characters simply standing in a line  or walking in a line  it never feels natural  one part has the bad guys (are they bad guys? who cares?) park their jeeps in a row and then get out and stand in a row while the other army stand in  you guessed it  a row  this keeps happening some of the creature designs are kind of cool  like the dragons which look like stylised drawings rather than real creatures  but they lead nowhere  they aren't developed  nor hyped up before  just thrown in your face  including the massive dragons at the end  to make a fight between giant  flying dragons boring is quite the achievement  but shang chi pulls it off cliches abound in this bore fest  the comedic relief sidekick learns archery in a day or two and saves the day with a ridiculous shot  why didn't any of the archers who had years of training do the same thing? how can an arrow travel that far so easily? it cheapens everything  they didn't earn it  they just did it because that's what movies do  right?the physics are awful  why do i care? well  reality matters  i much prefer movies where things actually make sense than those where the pixels are having a seizure  characters say one liners and there are no stakes or consistency at all  ignoring physics means making up random events with no real danger  suspense or skill  on the part of the characters or the screenwriters shang chi is one of the most superficial movies i've seen for a while  great entertainment for 10 year olds  perhaps  but utterly dull to most true movie enthusiasts  the moments are forced and predictable  there's no magic  the music's forgettable  the acting and script tick boxes rather than engage you at best  it has some colourful action and a few funny lines  it shows just how skillfully made good action movies are  including the russo brothers mcu movies ,Positive
207,story was ok and different from the rest  performances were on point and choreographies though a bit of dancing in some scenes were very accurate and convincing  what i really enjoyed and marvelled at most were the effects and fighting scenes  marvel studios really tops in this department always  the effects of the ten rings were amazing topped with serious blending in the fight scenes    made me enjoy this movie a lot and highly recommend it for the techies ,Positive
208,one time watch  too fast of a character transition in 2 weeks even for superhero movies standards  some nice action scenes  but the one where the father meets the mother takes the limelight  soul sucker demon was much weaker than what was stated in the movie and final fight ends up real fast  the mcu widens up ,Positive
209,such an amazing film  unlike some of the other marvel movies that imo try too hard to be cool or emotional and end up taking themselves way too seriously  shang chi feels very organic in everything it does  the story is well paced and unfolds gradually without feeling like things were being dumbed down or overexplained  the visuals were absolutely stunning  comedic relief was always on point  fight sequences were sleek yet powerful  i had high hopes for shang chi and it absolutely delivered  very excited for what's to come next ,Positive
210,a very comfortable and beautiful movie  i listened very well and loved katie's character  she is the best it is very similar to the atmosphere of the movie maleficent part 2 very excited for second part ,Positive
211,the prologue is beautiful but drawn out and redundant  initially we meet car valet simu liu as shaun reprising his role as jung from kim's convenience  it is difficult to see past him as this character  intelligent but drifting in life  until the inevitable first fight which is extraordinarily well choreographed  much better than most of the subsequent fights  the main plot elements are dull  daddy issues  resentful sister  side kick jester girlfriend  this and the main arc (magic collectibles) are vehicles upon which to hang the fabulous cgi vistas  effects and gratuitous violence  in the round an enjoyable watch  but nowhere near the promotional hype nor the 'best movie ever' hysteria ,Positive
212,"for the first hour or so  i fully expected this to be one of my favorite movies of the year  rate it 9  well done  and most of all believable  yes  even the improbable fighting (the bus!!!!) worked because it was just well done  well acted awkwafina was amazing  sure  she was her  if you hate her comedian character  you'll hate her here  but she's written perfectly  and fills the role of the plucky sidekick better than it's been done  this is what cringey rob schneider roles back in the 90s were seeking; an everyman with some snark to say ""now i don't even know what is going on"" and ground the film  force things to be explained to us then ben kingsley popped in from another movie entirely  with a role that was troublesome but also stupid  and pulled the big lever to make it a normal mcu last two acts  long monologues to explain things  some more flashbacks to tell us stuff we already pretty much understood  so rob the emotional payoff instead  set up/train  then big fight  yawn  same old stuff  all very predictable  which is good as it's unwatchable  confusing so disappointing how they totally lost their way with story and choreography at the end ",Positive
213,a younger shang chi (simu liu) is compelled to go back to his father's risky organization  the ten rings  he groups up together along with his excellent pal katy (awkwafina) and his estranged sister xialing (meng'er zhang) to forestall wenwu for good shang chi and the legend of the ten rings mark mcu's first asian led superhero film  there had been asian characters before  inclusive of wong (benedict wong) from doctor strange and hogun (tadanobu asano) from thor  but they have constantly been sidekicks  flunkeys  or comedian relief wenwu is a powerful crime lord who runs an evil empire constructed across the energy of ten historical earrings that he makes use of to generate blasts of energy shang chi is a heart warming tale syringed with humor  co writer director destin daniel cretton knows his circle of relative dynamics and superbly units the tone  despite the humanity on show  it is the revolutionary martial arts that are the usp  the movement would not depend closely on virtual trickery withinside the actual world the chemistry among the actors is palpable  exuding an actual feel of a located own circle of relatives  the film's actual villain is grief  pushed via way of means of wenwu at the cost of his children shang chi is a prevailing mixture of the chinese way of life and a hit marvel formula  despite pacing issues  it supplies a highly unique step withinside the proper path for asian representation  simu liu  awkwafina  and tony leung deliver multi faceted characters to life ,Positive
214,i'm not someone who is a fan of action movies  i'm really not  but even here  there's no denying the action sequences are brilliantly executed and have a lot more of a hit than most of the marvel movies out there although simu liu falters a little bit as a leading man  he has a truly impressive cast to support him  awkwafina is brilliantly funny and quippy as she always is  and tony leung  the complex antagonist and the hero's father  has the most depth in this film the visual effects are beyond beautiful  they reminded me of ferngully  and the nature i observed as a child  good stuff!there are some surprising cameos that are both hilarious and wholesome it was so good to see it in imax after such a long cinema hiatus  definitely check this one out!,Positive
215,'black widow' may have been the first marvel cinematic universe film to hit theaters following the recommencement of major films debuting in theaters after the covid 19 pandemic numbers dropped  however  'shang chi' is the true start of the next wave of mcu development  all of the original characters  minus thor  have been retired from service by death or other means so new blood is required via new superheroes and new origin stories  and given the current state of affairs look for a much more diverse flavor of super hero going forward  'shang chi' marks the first step on that path with the first true asian super hero to hit the big screen starring simu liu in the title role who is originally from china although his parents immigrated to canada when he was only five  the actors and characters here are almost entirely asian lending credibility to the character and the plot  co stars include awkwafina  meng'er zhang  michelle yeoh and tony leung thousands of years ago xu wenwu discovers these ten magical rings which he can wear to give him great power and immortality  he wields them through the centuries to collect power  in 1996 he journeys to the hidden entrance of a village known as ta lo to accumulate more power  he meets a woman  ying li  guarding the entrance and she is able to match him in a martial arts fight  he leaves but returns and eventually love sprouts between the two  for a time he sets aside the rings and power and starts a family resulting in two children but when ying li dies he reverts to his old ways and raises his kids under his authoritarian rule within his ten rings criminal organization  he raises son shang chi to be a warrior  but shang flees  leaving his sister  and starts a new life in san francisco  there he exists as a normal guy with job as a car valet  he is kind of an underperforming slacker  but seems happy with where he is  his best friend is katy played by awkwafina  one day shang chi is attacked on a bus and his medallion is stolen and he knows his father has found him  this launches him and katy on a quest to find his sister and foil his father's nefarious plans before he destroys the mythical town where his mother is from by unleashing some kind of hellspawn demon into the world while 'shang chi' is raking in rave reviews my response is a bit more measured  i think this is a solid origin story and introduces a dynamic new character that could prove to be a vital part of this next phase of the mcu  i think simu liu is well cast as is awkwafina as his best friend/sidekick  but i thought overall the film was better than average rather than the superlative  next level action hero blockbuster i was expecting  first i feel that the film is derivative in its plot a bit  some of this comes from the fact that i just saw 'raya and the last dragon' and this feels a lot like that movie  they both even feature awkwafina and 'shang chi' even has a dragon in final climactic battle sequence  i thought it was clever  but also clearly revisionist history to have ben kingsley's much maligned trevor (aka the mandarin)  from 'iron man 3' make an appearance  that was clearly designed to undo the plot misstep that was utilizing the mandarin and the ten rings in that film as a sham terrorist organization  i very much enjoyed all the martial arts action and the fights were very well filmed and choreographed  the actual ten rings of power that eventually get passed to shang chi by the end felt like a bit of one trick pony  they were kind of cool and clearly powerful  but the artifact's power set remained a bit unclear and their use while visually stimulating seemed very cartoonish at times  i am not sure how to rectify the look of the ten rings when employed  but i was hoping for better on that front  i was also perplexed a bit by the clear takeover of the ten rings organization by shang's sister at the film's close which seems designed to lead to a larger plot in a different film  but that move also is very reminiscent of what sharon carter is doing over in the disney plus mcu shows most of the time i found myself asking the larger mcu questions rather than enjoying this film  this came in the form of the appearance of wong and emil blonsky (aka abomination) in an underground fighting ring in macau run by shang chi's sister  why are this two disparate mcu supporting characters there and also why do they appear to be in allegiance as one is a hero and the other a villain? the other mcu connections come in the post credit scenes where wong pulls hastily minted super heroes  and possibly new avengers  shang and katy  into his sanctum santorum for a powwow with captain marvel and bruce banner regarding the ten rings artifact which are emitting a mysterious signal  the most important piece of all this would seem to be the glaring absence of doctor strange there is a lot of good stuff to take away from 'shang chi'  the film is full of some new and dynamic characters  marvel needs these characters to catch fire if they are going to build this next phase of the mcu into something that can culminate in an 'infinity war/endgame' level event  this is a good story  even if a tad derivative  and it is filmed and executed well  it has some prototypical mcu style humor  mainly due to awkwafina  but the humor is more low key than a lot of other mcu films  the well choreographed fight scenes are about the best thing here  they are fun and intense and really take me back to boyhood trying to absorb as many martial arts movies as i could  this is a solid entry  especially as an origin story  into the mcu  i liked the film and the character of shang chi  it remains to be seen how he will be integrated  going forward  into the larger cinematic universe eric's grade: b ,Positive
216,"""you know  that my village has been guarding for thousands of years and we always have to defend it from people who hear voices giving them a reason to re open it  so if you ever hear such a voice  be a dear and don't try to open it  k?""if they had that one simple conversation during their entire marriage then this film wouldn't exist it's ok thiugh  lots of kicky punchy kickpunch ",Positive
217,strong camerawork  especially during action sequences  action sequences are engaging and creative  very little bloat with narrative   excellent score and sound design  awkwafina can be hit and miss but she fits nicely into the film  solid heartfelt moments  strong performances all around  marvel formula at play but things felt fresh  strong  fleshed out villain performance and presence ,Positive
218,yet another lame superhero movie  their decision to really explore into the family conflicts is nice  though the whole thing is still very cliche  there's no personality in the main character beyond that he is asian  i really hate the score  all of them are garbage asian trap music  it was fairly hard to sit through  the whole 2 hours felt like 2 days  there's no risk nor consequences in the action scenes  they're all really tame  some lines are extremely corny and the frequent flashback ruined the movie  that also shows how lazy and uncreative marvel is at storytelling  spending all their budget at crappy costume  big star actors and special effects while forgetting everything else ,Negative
219,after a disappointing marvel entry with black widow  shang chi is the return to form movie marvel needed to bounce back off on  with solid performances  great setpieces  fun action sequences  and some emotional depth and humour to it  it's the type of film you need to see on the big screen and just go along with the journey and fantastical elements  it's also paced well and intriguing for the runtime it has the direction is solid and the characters get a good amount of screen time each to develop and have well placed flashback sequences  the martial arts fights are pretty well done and the cgi creatures look interesting with their designs and have good special effects  overall  it's very well done and i didn't think marvel could keep going  but they proved they can still make great stuff when they care about it 8/10 ,Positive
220,"a brilliant blend of chinese (asian) culture and superhero storytelling infused ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" with a level of excellence and beauty  wonder and awe  that only such a film can capture directed by destin daniel cretton  this movie from marvel was a lush planet of possibilities in their already gilded multi verse  i enjoyed every second of this film  especially what each of its cast brought to it simu liu as the titular shang chi (alias shaun) was outstanding in the lead role  he more than breathed life into this popular comic book character  i truly appreciated the 'less is more' approach to his performance ben kingsley as trevor slattery and awkwafina as katy were both scene stealers  a powerhouse support performance came from michelle yeoh   i've been a huge fan of hers   who played ying nan tony chiu wai leung as xu wenwu (the 'big bad') was remarkable  meng'er zhang as xialing was superb  so was fala chen as li and florian munteanu as razor fist  i also liked what andy le brought to his role as death dealer  wong  played by benedict wong  made interesting cameos  the younger versions of xialing and shang chi   played by elodie fong and jayden zhang  respectively   were both good  shang chi's teen version played by arnold sun was also good screenplay by dave callaham  destin daniel cretton  and andrew lanham left no loose ends  the mandarin inclusions added realism to the film's characters  the writers took familiar and established asian movie storytelling techniques and gave it a marvel ian twist that i found enormously admirable steve englehart and jim starlin were the original creators of this superb superhero  namely shang chi  in marvel canon  i'm sure they stand proud knowing what this movie has done to capture the spirit and resolve of their hero bill pope's cinematography and joel p  west's musical scoring were both significant drivers of credibility and entertainment for disney+ hotstar's ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings""  they both did an excellent job art direction and production design  as well as set decoration and stunts  and vfx/special effects/animation/cgi all did mighty good work on this project  not a single frame felt 'less than' or 'just enough'  the crew in these departments certainly went out of their way to instil a 'larger than life' sense with every choreograph and sequence in the movie costume design by kym barrett deserves special mention  she has done great work before on other notable titles  her talents were more than perfect for ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" on disney+ hotstar  she balanced asian flavour with signature marvel style  a task not altogether simple there is more going on in this deeply meaningful and potently symbolic movie than meets the eye  such glorious kung fu scenes as well  fans are sure to enjoy everything that ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" has to offer  don't forget to watch that end credits scene   it looks like we're getting a sequel  there's also a deleted scene available to be honest  i have not read a single comic book featuring the titular hero  but i have heard of him  my first proper introduction to shang chi was (technically) in this movie  and i must admit it drew me to appreciate and be inspired by the character on multiple levels ",Positive
221,i've been watching marvel films for years and while i do almost always enjoy them i often come out underwhelmed  shang chi actually managed to pleasantly surprise me and while i do think it dragged slightly in the third act i really enjoyed it the film manages to balance it's humour and seriousness far better than other marvel property's and also incorporates aspects from other films without feeling too forced  instead adding to the worldbuilding  the action is possibly the best of any marvel film and obviously takes a lot of influence from jackie chan films with i believe the stunt coordinator having worked with chan in the past  the acting is all good with simu liu really shining and while i wasn't a massive fan of awkwafina's character at the start i did find myself liking her development in the final act  i think shang chi manages to take what works so well about the mcu and polish it but this doesn't mean it's without it's flaws i did enjoy the emotional link between the villain and shang chi  but i thought that there were far too many flash backs telling us of how this relationship has developed  i also think that the third act was a bit of a let down with the action evolving into pretty basic cgi fights and most of the personal edge that lent itself so well to the rivalry between shang chi and win wu being lost  there are also some big plot holes and things that just don't make sense  the score is underwhelming and i'm not a massive fan of some of the villain's costume designs  however while this film does have it's flaws it was still a very enjoyable movie that i will likely watch again  the cast is good  cinematography different from the usual stuff the mcu has to offer and i like that marvel didn't shy away from using a lot of subtitles and having characters speaking lot's of chinese  very enjoyable and i'd recommend it to any marvel fan  7/10 ,Positive
222,i normally don't like these kinds of marvel movies  but this one was pretty entertaining  it was mainly a movie about crazy martial arts  all the other stuff is trivial  this rating is simply for the action and fight scenes  it was top notch ,Positive
223,i was really looking forward to this film  and was excited to see shang chi in the mcu  it started out good with an interesting father  and son character development  as the film continued  it seemed to rely very heavily on the cgi  after a while all the cgi felt bloated and overwhelming  the acting was well done  by everyone in the film no weak links  was hoping this film  would have had a more grounded plot like iron man ,Positive
224,"is it just me or does there seem to be a formula to these movies? i did enjoy it but   maybe this is what's been happening for most of my life   
surprise powers   forming allegiances   epic fight for ending   most main characters live   
got got my attention(starting with the book/s) because someone major died in the first book   i was just 'cruising along' and then it was   holy feces!(this is a word i've used as a nurse  noone blinked  so please don't trash this review because of it  thanks  i also could've said 'excretions'  fyi)  they killed that person?!??!what gave the avengers 'balance' and endgame one of the greatest movies from marvel is that some of the heroes didn't make it   it's drama  not comedy   joke if you want but when people are dying that are close to you  it ain't a laughing matter   makes for good drama   
sokay   i was definitely entertained(and surprised at how much i was enjoying it)  first rate production values everywhere i could see   and   the humor was well paced  as well   it didn't seem as long as it was because the story was well paced  as well   and when you have a story to tell it's great that it's allowed some time to tell it   how many times have you found yourself sitting in a movie seat when the credits are rolling feeling like something(s) was left out? happens often with book adaptations   and this is a 'book' adaptation  right?i'd give it an 8 0 high grade in my book   ",Positive
225,it's one of the best recent phase 4 mcu movies   although simu liu supposed to be the main lead but tony leong steals all the scene he is in   the martial arts is great too    kudos to the casting director who brings in hong kong actors and actress to join in the mcu cast such as michelle yeoh and yuen huadefinitely a must watch for asianfor the cgi i appreciate that it brings china mythical creature to the big screen ,Positive
226,shang chi does what most of the mcu does well  and without too many dumb moments or flaws to bring it down  it even exceeded in areas like the fight scenes  which are easily the best in the mcu  and even some of the humor  those fights were very well choreographed  well shot  and even very creative at times  despite going back to the big cgi battles by the end of it  it was still done far better than most in the mcu  and while not all the humor lands  i will say that it was probably funnier than most mcu movies  especially with the inclusion of trevor slattery  who was hilarious  did not expect to enjoy him so much however while it's superficially very good  it was still mostly a very basic mcu film  it lacked a lot of depth that stopped it from being more than just pretty good or decent  there were a ton of flashbacks and exposition dumps about the lore that got a bit too repetitive  but at the same time i wish they delved more into it  honestly i feel like this movie would've worked better as a 3 hour epic  the first half focuses on wenwu in the past  we get to see from his perspective why he wanted so much power and to conquer  all the lore gets shown to us without needing to explain it  then see how he changes through the romance  and finally see how he raised his children  how that all played out with time and care  then the second part of the movie switches to the present which delves deeper into examining how wenwu affected his children  how they dealt with it  the generational divide  etc  and imagine the 2 protagonists of each half going against each other  there's so much to explore there thematically with parenting  violence  culture  growth  etc  but not much is done  obviously my idea is too much to ask for  but i just thought that this movie lacked a lot of depth  we get the basics of the characters  but not much more  these characters have some of the most simple and basic arcs mcu fans have been so deprived of good villains they thought wenwu was refreshing even though he's extremely cliched  and made okay just because of the great tony leung  another amazing actor wasted  but at least he was better than the average mcu villain  overall this movie gets back to what the mcu was known for  and it succeeds better in some aspects too  first good project in phase 4! but it also lacks some of the depth that could've made this one of the best mcu movies  making me think it won't hold up as well on rewatch (6 9/10)note: this is an old review i had in my notes i didn't originally post because i would eventually add more to it  but since i haven't yet i thought might as well do so ,Positive
227,there is an instant thrill in having a supersized marvel superhero movie begin with a voiceover in mandarin as tony leung comes into the frame  one of the world's great actors  leung exerts an effortless majesty  in shang chi and the legend of the ten rings  he plays wenwu   an immortal who possesses 10 rings with enormous occult power  wenwu  also known as the mandarin  heads a criminal organisation called the ten rings  which was introduced in the first iron man movie  he is a man tormented by an insatiable lust for power  which somehow gets submerged under his love for his wife but then resurfaces after her death as something even more twisted and vicious  wenwu is one of the more tragic villains in the mcu and leung plays him with a melancholic charisma that doesn't let up even in the climax as several cgi creatures twist and snarl and prey on everything in their path  he is one of the many pleasures of this film read the full review on film companion ,Positive
228,it's always fun to go to the theater for a new mcu production    a chance to see something **new** that you know will be well produced and will keep on stretching their shared universe of superheros  with shang chi it looks like their phase 4 is well and truly launched  and you can already glimpse what marvel studios' overall approach is going to be  (more below )just like black widow was marvel's run at doing a james bond type film  shang chi is their try at doing the chinese martial arts thing  the result is a kind of compromise westernized version that falls between two poles  for sure though  you'll be entertained  there's more than enough action  a lot of strikingly beautiful settings  and fun characters  but before i forget    the mid credits scene is one of the best they've ever done and totally worth staying for  (that's where the quote i put in the title above comes from    a certain familiar character telling shang chi to sure  come on in and join the craziness ) it does the usual thing of tossing the baton forward to whatever the next production will be  but it's stylistically so clever that it really stands out and the film itself: it fills up its 2:12 runtime with a whole lot of material and a lot of characters  maybe too much  the third act in particular veers off onto a fantasy type track that doesn't entirely fit well with the previous hour and a half of setup  and the scenes in that last section suddenly feel more rushed  gone are the days of the first iron man or thor or ant man movies with their lean  linear storylines and single well defined themes  instead  marvel now seems to want to overstuff every one of their productions  even if they involve 'secondary' mcu characters  and turn them into epics  more and bigger is not always better  is it?i did like the cast  marvel always does an impressive job bringing in good people  nice to see there are no less than 4 (!) major roles for females  as opposed to 2 for males  and they mix and match well  of the mostly young cast though  i thought the older pair (tony leung  michelle yeoh) really stood out    they effortlessly dominate the screen when they are on  leung's character could have been a stock  one dimensional scenery chewing villain  but he's much more nuanced than that  simu liu (the lead role  shang chi) is not exactly a great actor just yet  but he's athletic and cute and attractive with a sense of humor and for this role he doesn't need to be much more than that  awkwafina  as katy  does her usual turn with comic relief and side commentary with a dash of romance  as for trevor slattery (ben kingsley)    that came out of nowhere and he's absolutely out of place  but somehow it works partly because of his pet that rises to disney levels of cuteness about phase 4  the first three cycles introduced and used particular major characters that were all required to fit under the avengers umbrella  now it's the post avengers era and from their scheduled series of releases up through 2023  we'll see a much more diverse slate of characters and stories that don't obviously fall under a single umbrella  if they do have a master plan for something equivalent to the avengers  it's hard to see what it is  maybe  they'll use this new freedom just to show us interesting stories in a bigger universe ,Positive
229,after the mulan remake  it was safe to say that i was thoroughly disappointed  the portrayal of chinese culture  even in the mystical sense  just felt like a disaster  but this one  oh this one was so much better  i was actually impressed  it felt like it was actually catered to a different market this time  while someone unfamiliar with chinese culture may find it to be 'just another marvel movie(albeit an amazing one)  to those who know  you will be treated to something that has been basically non existent in hollywood films  aka inside jokes/depth of knowledge that really helps elevate the film to a whole nother level ,Positive
230,this movie gave me hope that there are still bright days ahead for the mcu  shang chi is very different from what we've seen in the past but it's so good  it's visually stunning and the action sequences are thrilling  it had the quality of action that i was expecting from black panther  the ten rings are fascinating to watch in use  there were such epic moments that i had to rewind and watch again a few times  i really wish i could have seen this is imax  it's one of the few movies that would have been a truly special experience with a story like this one  things could have very easily taken a downward turn into the realm of cheesiness and over the top  but it's all done so well  the comedy and serious moments are balanced really well  there are some real laugh out loud moments but the movie never feels silly  the back flashes are interesting and meaningful one of my favorite surprises of this movie  is that it redeems the worst villain twist of the mcu  you know marvel and disney have done well when we look forward to seeing these new characters in the future ,Positive
231,"it had potential but marvel has this tendency of degrading everything into mindless comedy   things just happen  to an extent where awkwafina is now an avenger   
i'm getting too old for this s# t  ",Negative
232,another amazing marvel film with awesome visual effects  i think they did a great job blending asian culture within film  give me more second tier marvel characters ,Positive
233,going in to watching shang chi the legend of the ten rings i was apprehensive and didn't think that this was the right way for the mcu to go however after watching it i am happily proven wrong! it is an amazing film with some of the best action sequences  great cgi and a engaging plot  it has a good balance of emotional moments and comedy moments ,Positive
234,its okay  not great  the first half of the movie was better then the second half  they kind of lost me once they introduced all the fantastic beasts  i just want to know why i should care about shang chi  would of been better to introduced him in a previous movie like endgame threw the portals  im sure in the future of the mcu this movie will become more relevant  and he will play a bigger part  but the sad truth is take away the mcu connections and i would not have even watched this movie ,Positive
235,8/10 enjoyed the movie it was very entertaining didn't seem like over 2 hours long  action packed  awesome effects a definite must watch  funny moments never dull ,Positive
236,the first film in the mcu's next phase was black widow  but that film  which featured scarlet johannson's swan song as the title character  felt very much like it was grounded in what had come before  but shang chi: the legend of the ten rings very much breaks new ground  and takes us into a heretofore only hinted at corner of the marvel universe  it's the origin story of the title character  a martial arts superhero  but he is not nearly as well known as spider man or captain america  so we are not treated to yet another iteration of uncle ben's demise  instead we are given a fleshed out story of a tragic family  one without easily defined villains  shang chi joined the marvel comic scene in 1973 in an attempt to create a character that could cash in on the kung fu craze at the height of bruce lee's popularity  he had his own book for many years  interacting with other marvel heroes  and if he has not been a marvel regular in recent decades  shang chi has never gone away  and retained the loyalty of many hardcore fans like all origin movies  shang chi begins with some exposition and back story  specifically concerning his father  wenwu  played by tone leung  a power hungry thousand year old immortal  who wields the ten rings of the title  a fearsome mystical weapon of an unknown source  only when he meets li  played by fala chen  a fighter from the hidden realm of ta lo  does he find someone who is his equal in combat  falling in love  wenwu forsakes his violent ways  and starts a family with li  but in every hero's origin story there must be a tragedy  and when li is murdered by wenwu's rivals  he seeks vengeance  becoming the villain he once was  and teaching his son and daughter how to become deadly assassins  when we meet shang chi  well played by simu liu  he is a twenty something chinese immigrant living in san francisco making a living as a parking valet with his best friend/girlfriend  katy  played by awkwafina  having broken from his father's world  but as with most stories centering on estranged families  the plot turns on them being drawn back together  and wenwu needs a pair of pendants belonging to shang chi and his sister that were gifts from their mother because they are essential  he believes  if he is to free his deceased spouse from the dark realm  whose entrance lies inside ta lo  and if shang chi doesn't want to go along with dad's plan  too bad  it all comes to a head in an epic battle in ta lo in a cgi heavy third act   pretty much a staple for the mcu i liked this movie because it has plenty of energy  with great well done action scenes  along with some spectacularly staged martial arts battles  it also has a lot of heart  with characters who are easy to become invested in  and this lighter touch is welcome after the dark turns of avengers: infinity war  in tony leung  it has a great villain with an understandable motive  something essential with any good super hero film  simu liu is an appealing lead  and he's matched all the way by awkwafina's katy  an underachiever who discovers special skills  i am not always impressed with cgi laden film making  but i don't mind it here because i actually care about the all too human characters involved in the action  the finale in ta lo is supposed to be the high point of the movie  but for me  nothing beats the battle on the careening city bus on the streets of san francisco early in the film  where shang chi first shows his true martial arts prowess against his father's minions  led by the fearsome razor fist  played by the physically impressive florian monteneau  michelle yeoh has a part as a village elder  and out of nowhere  ben kingsley returns as actor trevor slattery  thus redeeming what for many of us fans what was one of the more disappointing villain tweaks from iron man 3 an early scene at a hong kong fight club firmly establishes that all this is happening in the mcu with appearances by benedict wong's character from doctor strange  and the abomination from the hulk  wong returns in a post credits scene that clearly sets up shang chi and katy for the big leagues in the next phase of the mcu  will they learn where the ten rings came from  and maybe does the eternals have anything to do with it? and there is the dangling plot thread of what exactly happened when shang chi was sent to kill the man responsible for his mother's death when he was 14; it was the event that estranged him from his father  something tells me we will find out in some future installment  i can hardly wait ,Positive
237,it took marvel again some time to make a appreciating movie  well done  i liked the kung fu fightings  really cool and not forced or over exaggerated and most importantly  fluent and not much slowed down  it lacked something  otherwise i would have rated it higher  of course there was awkward silence moments just like in marvel movies  but that's me and were expected  hope they will do more movies like these ,Positive
238,why continue? that was the main question i had after the great arc of the mcu phases 1 3  i know   financially it would be stupid to not go on but from a creative perspective   what can top those first three phases? black widow was okay as a stand alone picture and the same can be said by shang chi  it is not a bad film  it's entertaining enough  the character of katy is fun and the action (a lot of waving around with the arms though) is sufficient  but despite its new characters and asian / martial arts vibes it does feels like i have seen it all before  i know i am not the target group for these films so probably that's the reason i'm getting bored by most mcu films  so  if you are looking for 2 hours of fun but utterly forgettable entertainment   this is okay  but then again; there are countless other films out there that can provide the same ,Positive
239,good: it has its own tone  sir kingsley  visuals  fight scenes stronger then before  but not mind blowing in any way bad: fan servicing china market way too hard  exploiting every possible trope and going into stereotype territory in every little thing  seriously  roll back a little  most characters underdeveloped and a grey faceless bland  every character is toned down and underacted on top of that  even fantastic characters they already had  like mandarin   toned down for no reason  in general very forgettable  predictable and average marvel movie  with no critical elements for the saga ,Negative
240,"for nearly ten years after its inception  the marvel cinematic universe was dominated by the adventures of white men  scarlett johansson's black widow had to fight to get her own film this year  while her male co stars got entire trilogies   ""black panther"" reinvigorated the franchise with its celebration of african culture in 2018  proving that the marvel brand didn't have to be so beige  ""captain marvel"" became the first mcu film to be fronted by a woman  now  ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" marks the first asian led film  not only does the film feature the first asian protagonist  it also features a predominantly asian cast and crew  which  thankfully  give this franchise a much needed change in perspective the ten rings have been around for nearly a thousand years  gifting their wearer  wenwu  immortality so that he may rule with unmatched strength  after centuries of building an empire out of blood  wenwu was turned away from a life of violence by ying li  a guardian of the mystical land of ta lo  when heartbreak struck shortly after  wenwu picked up the rings once again  causing him to go down a dark path  and his son  shang chi  to run away to the united states  now after ten years  the son must come home to confront his father and become who he was truly meant to be similar to what ryan coogler was able to do with ""black panther""  co writer/director destin daniel cretton brings out the best of this new world as he is able to handle the mountains of establishing exposition  his use of flashbacks may be a bit liberal  especially as the film reaches its climax  but they're used meaningfully to build upon a story focused on character and culture without a leading acting credit to his name  simu liu takes the titular role by storm as he navigates this typical hero's journey with charm and composure  mixing a bit of t'challa with tony stark  shang chi is a hero battling with his past and future  liu and cretton strike a great balance as liu hands himself over to cretton's material in the somber moments  and cretton lets liu's comedic instincts light up the room veteran tony leung brings the same melancholic energy to wenwu as he did in his roles with wong kar wai  particularly his work in ""in the mood for love "" leung layers this villain and distances him from the average world dominator  he carries a stillness about him that inspires fear and compassion  two things that have made some of the greatest villains the overall narrative within a marvel film is evenly composed of the plot and the action  thankfully  cretton blends both those halves together as he imbues the setpieces with the qualities of the wuxia genre  taking after such films as ang lee's ""crouching tiger  hidden dragon"" (also starring michelle yeoh) and zhang yimou's ""house of flying daggers "" the action often tells as much of the story as the dialogue  particularly in the gracefully dazzling opening sequence  but there's also room for brutality as the first act ends with a tower scaffolding brawl where shang chi's emotions turn him into a raw killer  not since ""captain america: the winter soldier"" has the action been so impactful on a technical and emotional level when allowed to be its own film  ""shang chi"" is quite the spectacle  but when it gets forcefully molded into a marvel film  the results are less than stellar  even after all his work with the story and action  cretton can't break free from the third act visual effects extravaganza that holds this franchise like an iron vice  it's a shame as the smaller familial moments do more for the mind and soul than the forgettable litany of explosions that encompass the final thirty minutes  being that this is the 25th film in the franchise  i've come to expect that level of disappointment thanks to its multi talented cast and crew  ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" is one of the better origin stories within the marvel cinematic universe  the action may (rightfully) be the selling point  but the heart of the film lies within its characters  telling a familiar story on an impressive scale ",Positive
241,"the charm of this movie comes from the setting of the main characters  showing a reflection of today's world  where asian culture and the way of life in the west creates an environment of searching for one's own identity and place   this is where we meet shang chi (simu liu) first  a young adult trying to navigate through his life far away from his family in the city of san francisco  his partner in crime is his best female friend katy (awkwafina) simu liu's character arc in this film is not significant  although he makes
a solid protagonist  his own character development is de minimis  awkwafina  by contrast  steals the film as the ordinary person caught up in the epic power struggle  her trademark zingers and bemused quips make her the perfect foil against the escapist superhero world that she  and we as the audience  are thrust into  mandarin (tony leung chiu wai) is a subtly effective marvel villain with a compelling family backstory; he is a cinematic antagonist with the most idealism and righteous sense of purpose since bill the butcher in ""gangs of new york"" michelle yeoh as shang chi's aunt jiang nan has again some great fighting scenes which stand up to her wonderful performance in ""crouching tiger  hidden dragon""  overall this movie has great fighting scenes  extraordinary effects  especially the flying dragons which are delightful to watch  highly recommended for everyone who likes superheroes and a touch of mysterious fairytales ",Positive
242,this was a good movie 1  even though my wife and i don't usually like this genre  we enjoyed this one 2  nora lum stole the movie  look for her in future films 3  the prettiest actress in the film was fela chen  even though she played the mother  also ;ook for her in future films ,Positive
243,great visuals   but one of the most boring storylines ever!very few fight scenes  weird soundtrack  very rushed   and awkwafina is one of the most annoying people i've ever seen   2nd only to melissa mccarthy!i'm not really a marvel fan  but i just thought this would be better ,Negative
244,marvel is back to its root with this one it is not perfect film but hell of lot more entertaing than black widow and far from home and their is big surprise in the film which i wont spoil but yeah watch it in the theaters or home but watch it nontheless because its great film  with heart and soul with it ,Positive
245,"if it didn't have marvel on it then this would have been another kung fu movie  the story lacks a villain because the dad is a ""semi retired warlord"" who temporarily sacrifices his immortality for love  he's shown in the beginning as being greedy and lusting for power  afterwards he falls in love and hangs up his rings for love and family  i didn't buy it   
throughout the movie every major choice the villain makes is made out of ""insanity"" or by ""grief"" from the loss of his wife  there's also a lack of racial diversity in this movie that is almost every marvel movie ",Positive
246,good visuals  decent story  decent action  some comedy  aka your typical marvel movie  that said  i thought that this was a good origins story  it was enjoyable  i'd totally watch this over red notice any day ,Positive
247,top 5 greatest marvel movies ever made  the choreography of the fights are beautiful  the cgi is beautiful the story is beautiful  just watch it ,Positive
248,shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is the first entry in mcu phase 4 with a completely new superhero  an origin story  and is about shang chi  son of a powerful man who has control of the ten rings as well as having an organization of the same name  living a normal life  his world is turned upside down when the past he has left behind comes back to bite him  not gonna lie  i wasn't hoping much from this movie considering how disappointing phase 4 has been but to my surprise  this turned out to be the most entertaining entry in this post infinity saga so far  particularly because i didn't leave it filled with a layer of disappointment that gets worse the more you think about it it's not groundbreaking or different from what the mcu has given us before  especially when it comes to origin stories  in fact  it feels very reminiscent of the earlier movies that came in this cinematic universe following a lot of the same formula  part of the reason i enjoyed it as it reminded me of the good ole days where i was genuinely hyped about the mcu and getting introduced to all these superheroes without having any solid comic book reading history  it's the usual marvel schtick with a different skin but with good enough execution in certain parts that you get a steady flow of entertainment and hardly any major frustrations  if at all  from the entire 130 mins runtime what i enjoyed the most was the action sequences  which were predominantly hand to hand combat and weaponry based kung fu  with good choreography and cinematography  fewer cuts  non shaky cam  and the actors performing a lot of the combat themselves  it was thrilling  the accompanying soundtrack was nice too with a mix of modern and east asian tracks that flowed well with the action the story itself  while ending up with the usual end of the world trope that so many superhero flicks have  wasn't bad either  it was cool to see this side of the world in this cinematic universe and not having a typical human baddie was nice as well however  the writing was still not particularly good as the movie sorely lacked urgency and stakes  there wasn't that ooomph that would have propelled this movie to higher tiers  it played safe and light with a lot of predictable elements so you just sorta experience the events which play out mostly how you'd expect  the dialogue could have been a lot better as well with the same story beats the movie employs and would have given characters a lot more depth where the emotional moments could have been hard hitting  the titular character himself felt lacking in energy and charisma i did like the overall ensemble and how it all came together in the end even if full of cliches  i was worried about awkwafina's character katie and that she'll be annoying for the rest of the movie but i was pleasantly surprised by her relationship with shang chi played by simu lu  it was sweet  i'm glad the humour wasn't in your face throughout and took a backseat at certain points as mcu lately has developed a habit of injecting way too much of their brand of humour and it hasn't worked for me  not saying the comedy here was great as some of it fell flat on its face but some of it did work all in all  despite its problems  despite the movie playing it safe  despite it being predictable  i had fun  i do hope simu lu gives a stronger performance wherever his character shows up next because compared to other mcu heroes  shang chi himself is among the lower end for me for now  if you like the mcu  then certainly give this a go  if nothing else  you'll probably enjoy the action  and if i were to rate it  i'd give it a 6 8/10 ,Positive
249,i really liked that the actors spoke their native language  mandarin  because it would've felt too americanized otherwise  but there was something unfinished about this movie and i'm not sure what it is  the pacing was alright  a little too slow or fast at times  and as far as storylines go  it was not as exciting as i thought it would be  the fight scenes were great though  especially the final grand battle scene ,Positive
250,the story is scripted by some white dude that eats avocado toast on a daily basis and it doesn't add value to the mcu at all  whats the point? better watch suicide squad instead ,Positive
251,shang chi's origin story starts with his father xu wenwu  xu wenwu is one of the many positive aspects  that make this movie such a joy to watch and such a surprising mcu movie: xu wenwu as the antagonist is a very complex character  you see his good and understand what motivates him to become the villain in this story shang chi is a very complex character  too  being drilled by his father to become an assassin by the age of 14 and getting the final mission to avenge the murder of his loving mother  but he got himself a new identity and name in the u  s   earns some money with part time jobs and enjoys karaoke nights with his girlfriend until the past catches up with him and starts a highly enjoyable  action heavy  fantasy blockbuster with stunning visuals (camera and fx)  excellent fight scene choreography  great soundtrack  great chemistry between the actors/characters  a lot of surprises  some asian lore and just a great entertaining story of the mcu some references to other mcu movies and stories appear (references to iron man part 3 and doctor strange part one)  but all in all this movie can stand on his own and that's a welcome surprise  too the makers of this movie did a great job  can't wait for the sequel highly recommended ,Positive
252,"shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is a great marvel studios film  the story was fun and engaging  and was surprisingly emotional  with shang chi's relationship with his father and sister  the father's death was surprisingly impactful  and which the movie did well  one issue with the story was that the film would take a pause with the plot for flashbacks and exposition  they do make the film boring and slow at times  but there's not many  plus  the flashbacks can be helpful
the visuals and action scenes in this film are  in my opinion  some of the best action scenes in the mcu  the film takes advantage of the martial arts action to deliver epic fight scenes  the visuals were also stellar  the cgi was top notch  and the backgrounds were some of the best from marvel the characters were all fun to watch  and throughout the movie  you feel engaged in these characters  shang chi and katy's chemistry is great  the villain was a great antagonist in this film  some characters were bland and forgettable  but the good ones shine the most throughout the film overall  it's a great mcu film with a compelling story  great fights and visuals  and engaging characters  it can be a bit slow at times  but the film is a must watch  my favorite mcu film since far from home ",Positive
253,it feels like a mash up of about 10 old movies anc 20 plots weaved into one film  for me i didn't enjoy it very much  there were positives but overall i didn't leave feeling like i'd seen something that special  it didn't feel like a marvel film  i'm not against diversity or going in different directions but it just wasn't a film i loved or would see again  the characters were bland and uninspiring  the humour was ok but bit same old same old and the plot which i'd guess you'd call the main theme felt a bit daft the cgi was awesome  graphics  choreography and costumes all really nice  parts were genuinely beautiful but if the film ain't doing much for me that doesn't matter think a lot would hinge on whether you got this gimmick or liked it  i didn't  they were cool for set pieces and what they wanted to achieve in the movie but i just felt they weren't something i thought was interesting or that impressive it was always going one way  it was pretty predictable and i didn't feel or believe the emotion as i found the story a bit stupid  it just felt directionless and they were trying to do so much whilst achieving very little it felt long to  much longer than the run time  it just wasn't a film i'd recommend and it was one i felt disappointed i maybe backwards though as everyone's saying this makes up for black widow  i don't get that  i thought black widow was brilliant  way better than this also it seems if it's asian and a bit funny everyone calls awkwafina ,Positive
254,the cinema was on fire  i think it was partly to do with katy and her crazy energy  and also that bus fight scene was incredible  it really got things going it's a very funny movie too  laughs were coming from the audience frequently  it was such a great time good story  amazing visuals  good comedy  some nice fights also the ten rings in action were spectacular to watch  the ten rings are brutal it's a major world event for the official start of the new mcu (black widow is a prequel) overall  as a movie it is probably an 8 out of 10 but because of the cinematic experience  that changes the game completely  it was a major cinematic experience  10 stars 🌟 for the ten rings 📀,Positive
255,i can't believe this came from marvel  the storyline was so basic  and sometime actually said this was better than black panther? must be watching a different movie  i mean if you have a dragon  why don't you just use it to kill your father  end of story  and apart from jumping around and punching people hard  the rings are basically useless  like i said  basic script  the least said about this  the better ,Negative
256,effectively an origin story for shang chi that marries the styles of superhero and martial art films wonderfully  and adds some much needed intrigue back into the marvel cinematic universe (mcu) i did legitimately enjoy the movie! it tries new things and is one of the more enjoyable mcu films  however  it did not quote tip the scale into becoming one of the best mcu movies in my opinion  at times  it felt a little too fantastical for my liking (especially the third act) the story  visuals  and characters are all pretty great! but i find the film mostly suffered from an ending that could have been more grounded in reality than it was  i am happy though  to see shang chi added into the mcu ,Positive
257,i decided to write this review after watching black wodow  eternals and shang chi  i understand the need to make a diversity movie  but all in all  aside from special effects  this movie can be easily replaced by almost any chinese martial arts production with high budget  it's not a marvel movie  it's a martial arts movie with mystic elements it's actually good in its own way  but it certainly doesn't get that marvel feel in all the previous movies  neither do eternals  nor even the black widow  despite glorious scarlett johannson i really wanted to see more of the same as the endgame  and not to invent the formula from scratch  it doesn't work just yet ,Positive
258,"the latest marvel film ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" directed by destin daniel cretton is fast paced  action packed and visually stunning masterpiece  that proves that marvel is stronger than ever  the fight choreography loosely inspired by jackie chan's and other asian martial arts films was insane and jaw dropping  carol danvers aka captain marvel  bruce banner aka the hulk and doctor strange's right hand man wong made cameo appearances in the mid credits scene  wong appeared twice in the film  while bruce and carol only appeared in the mid credits scene final verdict: 10/10 ",Positive
259,"shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is the latest comic book inspired action fantasy film from marvel disney studios  daniel destin crettin is the director the film stars simu liu (canadian television's ""kim's convenience"") as the title character  known as shaun in the beginning of the narrative  he's a late 20 something who works as a valet at a san francisco hotel with his carefree best friend katy (nora ""awkwafina"" lum)  seemingly okay with eking by earning a working class living  shaun's life changes when he receives a mysterious postcard  the next day a group of hitmen attack him on a bus  forcing him to reveal his potent martial arts prowess turns out  ""shaun"" was born to wenwu (veteran chinese cinema star tony leung)  a crime boss in china whose career has literally lasted centuries  thanks to a mysterious set of rings worn around his lower arms that grant magic powers   including  apparently  immortality  shang chi's mother ying li (fala chen) was a resident of a mysterious  magical chinese city   think shangri la or black panther's wakanda  possessing her own magic inspired martial arts skills  she convinced wenwu to temporarily leave behind his crime empire and start a family  it didn't last  leading to a family tragedy and shang's self imposed exile in america the plot has to do with wenwu's insistence on bringing shang and his sister xialing (menger zhang) back into the family fold  so they can collectively find the entrance to the mystic city  conquer the inhabitants and reunite with ying li  who wenwu insists whispers to him from beyond the grave  shang and xialing want nothing to do with their father's criminal empire  but wenwu is not above brutality to convince cooperation the film takes dramatic liberties with the original source material  part of this is legally necessary  as the comic book shang chi's father was originally yellow peril villain fu manchu   officially owned by the sax rohmer estate  additionally  the original comics posed shang as an agent of great britain's mi 6  with a mostly british supporting cast  including someone who ""playfully"" would refer to shang as (an ethnic slur for chinese/asians)  all of that backdrop is wisely eschewed for an all new set of allies and adversaries  katy provides comic relief and as a low key audience stand in  as a 2nd generation child of immigrants she also highlights the vantage point of someone who is very ""americanized"" who bristles at ""old school values and customs"" of her parents/grandparents but striggles to fulfill her own pathway in life simu liu gives a solid journeyman's performance as shang chi  he handles the action as well as the dramatic and comedic components  still  it's something of a role that's semi mired in exposition  because viewers mainly get to see his younger life in flashbacks the action is well choreographed  including ballet like scenes of combat and courtship alike  with nods to fantasy physics but never egregiously outlandish  the film also has beautiful cinematography courtesy of bill pope (his cinematography credits include 'the matrix' and the first three 'spider man' films) possibly the most fully realized performance is that of tony leung  who gets to portray a more in depth villain than is typically featured in most comic book movies  there are other solid supporting roles played by michelle yeoh and sir ben kingsley the climax of the film is filled with special effects based wonders including creatures of all sorts and mulan style fights between army legions  this can get dizzying for the non comics steeped layperson  so this may be overwhelming for some viewers  but the overall narrative is satisfying the film takes place independent of any particular goings in in the marvel cinematic universe  and it is only a post credits coda that links it to the greater marvel pantheon  this film can be enjoyed by itself without watching any of the ""avengers"" franchises it remains to be seen whether ""legend of the ten rings"" makes the shang chi character a household name alongside captain america  iron man and the rest but it is more than a worthy entry to the current phase of the marvel movie saga ",Positive
260,"another great marvel origin story  cast are all excellent especially awkwafina in a comedic role & ben kingsley getting some love after his undeserved trouncing as ""the mandarin"" in iron man 3 (i liked it)  marvel have another winner on their hands ",Positive
261,usually  mcu movies are forgotten as soon as i exit the theater  this one is much more emotional and serious  some flaws  but entertaining and engaging ,Positive
262,its your typical high flying kung fu action script layered on top of an uninteresting story with no depth the main character and his sidekick were tiring to watch because they are adults acting like teens  they never managed to become interesting  the acting however was fine so its not a knock on the actors themselves but the script was kiddie  they were clearly going for the teen demographic with this movie i personally couldnt enjoy it  marvel in general  hasnt really produced a film that i enjoyed in a very long time so its not really surprising  this might be fun if you are younger but for adults who have seen or read a lot of stories  this is probably not good ,Positive
263,kinda meh  but i like how everything reminds me of a well made kung fu movie but with marvel's sfx budget  still better than ant man  but not as good as wakanda ,Positive
264,"marvel unleash yet another usual formula of cgi overkill  amongst a rather thin plot  the hero  his sister and the done to death already annoying side kick find luck and convieneince in their side as they find their involvement with old myths and ninjas and dragons and ""oh look at that for no reason"" in a too fast paced to care whats going on while fully aware that flashing lights and sound arent going to make me think this absolutly predictable film holds more value than its truely worth  a pleasurable movie for those with add im sure  to the rest of us  it's just a bit of mortal kombat meets the never ending story and 300 ",Positive
265,the movie was awesome and very inspiring to all marvel fans   akwafina was absolutely hilarious and a great fighter   shang chi is about to join the avengers for the first time after endgame  i have this feeling shang chi and doctor strange will have to travel through time and space to find all places that he's never seen before  i hope to see shang chi travel to new york city or meet guardians of the galaxy and captain marvel and find some connections to the mcu  ,Positive
266,shang chi is a character i and many others  know very little about  which in marvels case offers up a clean slate to tell a fresh story  i'm happy to say they have delivered  marvel's newest outing is a kung fu superhero extravaganza  that is fully built on it's action and set pieces  the performances of simu liu and tony leung stand out amongst the pack and offer a great and rich story for marvels cinematic universe  though the film can at times feel bogged down by its origin story tropes  the direction of destin daniel cretton  the overall charm of its cast  and story make the film feel fresh and lively  i'm happy to welcome this crew to the ever growing mcu and cannot wait to see what comes next  hopefully more shang chi!,Positive
267,"usual marvel origin movie would be :
predictable story (check)
sarcastic tone with awesome punchlines(check)
ending with hyping for next movie(check)
it checked all necessary boxes on top of that the martial arts and awesome fast paced plot and cgi packed with stunning visuals and awesome score and that post credits was like cherry on top!it's a coolest marvel's superhero origin yet!",Positive
268,another terrible movie from the mcu which is so childish and embarrassing to watch  the casts are just awful that even look worse than the employees from a grocery store  the acting and reactions are just so stiff  unconvincing  overacted and stupid  the cg is unrealistic with bad compositing that didn't blend well with the scenes  the story is totally cliche and lame  which was so predictable from start to finish  and the best thing above all is their intention to expand the china market by putting in all the chinese elements but got banned by china  well done disney  do us a favor and stop bloating fake reviews everywhere to overrate the silly movies  this doesnt deserve anything over a 2 stars rating  it sucks ,Negative
269,shang   chi had some great elements  the martial arts  choreography  and a few easter eggs  the bad is when their is forced humor in a serious moment the few best details was the characters you were familiar with in the other mcu movies  wong  abomination  and trevor the fake mandarin from iron man 3  i love these great surprises the martial arts were also great  it felt more of a rush hour and crouching tiger   hidden dragon feel to it the movie had a family element to it  tragic for shang chi but when things get serious  and why does the studio want forced humor? we do not need karaoke  but they make it a joke in the end  i enjoyed it but i don't think it the best mcu movie ever compare to avengers infinity war and endgame ,Positive
270,"the very first question to be asked would be  ""why was this movie even made in the first place?"" it's one of those ones that tries to be too much and ultimately fails at everything  it starts off as a love story  then turns into ""filthy rich asians "" and then ends as a conventional action pic  a romantic feminist vibe is terribly present throughout the entire picture  which wouldn't be that bad if that was all it was about  but this movie has trouble settling on one single narrative  it's almost like an asian version of ""rocky horror picture show "" as is typical of this current generation of filmmaking  it's just another ""people running around doing things"" movie  the market is just saturated with these sfx garbage movies which this summer was full of!!",Negative
271,the stunts were solid and on fire! i just think that the action scenes were a bit more plentiful and less cgi because this has the making of a modern martial arts classic film  i also think that the plot is somewhat irrelevant and lacks more emotion ,Positive
272,after the big disappointment of black widow  it's safe to say i was anticipating a better outing for shang chi and thankfully i lived up the action is the films biggest plus point  it's where the best scenes are on show  the choreography is brilliant alongside its kung fu/john wick style fights the visuals are typical of a marvel film  solid as always  the film however lost its emotional resonance through its writing  the heart of a film mainly comes from the screenplay and i felt the writing was slightly lazy in parts and that heart faded it's neither a perfect nor terrible film  it's a solid one that i enjoyed  even if it was hard to truly gravitate towards the characters quote   'welcome to the circus'   wongrating   3/5 ,Positive
273,another marvel masterpiece  albeit a shift in perspective  we've seen the greek and roman mythologies come alive  now it's the asian's turn  and what a story unfolds on screen!!!a little crouching tiger  a splash of rush hour 2  and a hint of mortal kombat combined with bruce lee's kicks and akwafina's comedic timing turn this origin story into an original style for the superhero universe! might have been bad if it were in the wrong hands  but actors and director  the crew and producers  all together show their love of the story in every scene!behind every superhero is a story of loss  and it is doubly true for shang chi! his journey to redemption is littered in marvel lore  and the connections to other marvel films is as suprising as it is awesome! cannot say any more to avoid spoilers  but so much to love about this film it'll be hard to not yell some from the rooftop!,Positive
274,yeah this is a really enjoyable film  is it anything that unique or incredible   kind of  the action definitely is  the action is by far the greatest part of the movie  damn does it look sick  the choreography is excellent  the fighting is so fluid  it's so fast paced and carries momentum throughout  all that is due to the vfx which are ofc good for such a high budget film  now where i think the movie messed up a bit was the villain  the villain isn't bad per say but is just really bland and unoriginal  it actually gets really predictable towards the end  also the ending is just absolutely crazy  now don't get me wrong crazy is absolutely great for an over the top movie like this but it did take me out of the movie  the first section of the movie tho! amazing! the middle chunk   meh and the final mehwowmeh  the soundtrack is good  the side characters are stale  and the comedy is actually surprisingly good  but sometimes misplaced into serious scenes  that's about it   it's   it's good!,Positive
275,asian fighting style with western superhero movie  the fight scenes work excellently when kept grounded  which sounds strange for a superhero movie  the acting is somewhat flawed  and kicks from previous marvel movies do not work optimally either  for example  what does wong do in a battle arena?however  it will be exciting to see what the ten rings can be used for in the future under the auspices of marvel ,Positive
276,this movie was a thrill from start to finish  with emotional beats that worked every single time  there wasn't a moment in the film that i didn't think worked  to be honest the film wrapped itself up incredibly good  with no loose ends  while also teasing the future of the characters introduced in the film  there were some familiar faces in the movie  some that had been spoiled for me visuals were top notch  it was colorful  vibrant  coherent and just pure insanity at the third act it is entertaining  sad  wholesome  and extremely rewatchable  i personally loved every single second of it ,Positive
277,i thought it was just another junk chinese movie but it turned out to be not bad  i was surprised to see so many famous actors and actresses there  the topic and style are interesting  remind me some other films like they borrowed from but i can't tell which ones  some similarities but not exact copy  then i realized it's marvel movies  understandable  ending is typical marvel hero thinking  overall  not bad for a chinese version of marvel movies ,Positive
278,among the best marvel films and characters of the entire universe of movies  this is a moving and complex story that really resonated with me  the characters are all three dimensional and the performances are heartfelt  the action and martial arts choreography is among the best of the marvel films  the humor  fueled by akwafina's performance  is right on point  this film dances around the edge of the rest of the marvel universe but it is it's own sort and its own self contained world  you do not need to know this character  or have seen any other marvel movie to enjoy this one  simi liu is larger than life in the lead role  michelle yeoh  tony leung  benedict wong  fala chen  and menger zhang are terrific in the ensemble cast  many back story films are boring or wait too long to get into the action  not this one  i can't wait for a future installment ,Positive
279,one of the most beautiful marvel films as of yet  on top of that are the visual effects and the fight scenes top level  it will be interessting to see how shang chi will fit in the mcu and whem we will see him next  and btw wong is a legend  but yeah i should probably go now   ooor   ,Positive
280,some things are explained to death  other things are not explained at all  as frustrating as awkwafina and her vag  which by the end of the film i was for sure left wondering about  will she be stuck in the friend zone forever???also  our world advances every year  but we still have massive plot holes in films? nobody bothers checking this stuff? weak some scenes were quite stupid  by the end i was ready for it to be over  and no  i'm not a monster so a few things i did like here and there  mostly revolving around awkwafina  i really got a kick out of watching her character and i think she was a great addition to the film ,Positive
281,i am going to make a very bold statement  this is by far the best marvel film yet  absolutely incredible story line  great acting  funny  amazing art and trully brings asian culture to life ,Positive
282,first of all  i think people are overhyping this film a bit like they did black panther  is this the best mcu origin film ever ?? hell no !! there are atleast 3 better origin stories existing  but there's a lot of good things shang chi does that differentiates this film from the normal mcu film  the visuals are breathtakingly beautiful and unlike any mcu film i have seen  the tone of the film resembles chinese action movies more rather than mcu which is so refreshing  the first few fight scenes are just incredible and got me super hyped but the quality falls in the later scenes when it becomes a cgi monsterfest  the story is very predictable and full of narration and exposition  at its core its a very emotional family drama but the dialogues are not powerful enough to dig really deep and i craved for that in so many scenes  the performances are solid with awkwafina and ben kingsley providing great comedic relief  but the standout is tony leung  he generates such level of empathy and emotional suffering with just his eyes  he is the legend after all  overall its a really fun watch  but not as great as people are shouting it is ,Positive
283,the mcu is getting out of it's repetitive train of movies with an all new asian epic inspiring a new generation!,Positive
284,i was really hoping to like shang chi but i couldn't because of mainly three reasons: the first one is the most severe and it is the fact that i found myself very bored  especially in the last hour  i spent that time hoping that i could have the ability to skip 10 second at will like on youtube  the second problem is the fact that shang chi itself is not an interesting character as far as this movie treats him  he surely has potential and it is clear that marvel will be high on him in the future and i still have hope but in this movie i think i preferred at least four characters more than him and he is the protagonist  and finally the plot has various holes  especially regarding the ten rings as a criminal organization  the visuals and the action are good but it wasn't enough for me to like this movie ps: the mid credit scene is the best of the movie  really liked that one ,Positive
285,they include asian but not indian wow so racist this movie is marvel but bad  even though marvel is supposed to be good  it's bad since it's anti india    so disappointed   ,Negative
286,this is a low budget avatar movies with rings   i wish they did it much more better   the action martial artistry sequence at first was much better and slowly deteiorates to a slow mo fight of air bending    if the script is weak dont try to hype it up ,Positive
287,shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is the latest marvel superhero movie that stars simu liu as shang chi who is forced to confront his past after he was drawn into the ten rings organization headed by his father played by tony chiu wai leung  shang and his sister xialing played by meng'er zhang had witnessed their mother's death and work together to avenge her legacy and to protect the lands that her people came from  the plot was fun to watch with great visual effects and great supporting cast that also included awkwafina as the hero sidekick along with michelle yeoh who helps train shang the ways of his mother's unique way to defend  after all these years we now learn what happened ben kingsley and how he ended up with the organization after his encounter with iron man  overall great movie with a wonderful cast  definitely add this to your must see list ,Positive
288,"i once said after watching black panther  that it would be cool if there was an all asian cast similar to it  there were some all asian cast movies like crazy rich asian (2018)  but that is a romcom  and mulan (2020)  but that was bad  in comes shang chi which is the first asian lead superhero movie ever  the premise is ""martial arts master shang chi (simu liu) confronts the past he thought he left behind when he's drawn into the web of the mysterious ten rings organization""  so does shang chi succeed in giving us a good all asian cast big blockbuster or is it just another failed attempt?firstly  the action sequences and choreography are some of the best from marvel since captain america and the winter soldier (2014)  martial arts are the focus of the action scenes in shang chi and they are beautifully choreographed  we get the classic wire fu/floating style of crouching tiger but we also get some jackie chan style with the utilization of the environment for the action  each action scene is memorable and stunning to watch  additionally  the action scenes avoid using lots of cuts and shaky cam which i was so grateful for  it is also clear that the actors themselves rehearsed the choreography making the fights feel more believable and gratifying  it does become a more typical mcu action sequence by the third act but even that is still pretty enjoyable even if it isn't as good as the first two acts the cinematography by bill pope (matrix trilogy  spiderman 2 and 3  scott pilgrim) is also excellent in shang chi  skyscrapers and forests in marvel movies have never looked as good as it has in shang chi  bill pope and director destin use the lighting and colours very effectively and allow for some genuinely beautiful shots  the music score by joel p  west is also pretty good  joel utilizes more electronic sounds and pop/rap songs for the scenes in the city but uses more traditional asian instruments for the mystical areas  joel's score captures the scene and the pop/rap songs themselves are also quite good albeit not as memorable as the weeknd or lamar from black panther  i also love the story and exploration of ""family"" with shang chi whilst not using asian stereotypes  it also doesn't overuse humour like in marvel's previous outing  black widow (2021)  where they use jokes every couple of minutes and ruin a serious scene  shang chi thankfully avoids doing this  thus allowing the emotion of a scene to linger longer  there are still jokes though but they are genuinely quite funny furthermore  simu liu is charismatic  charming and cool as the titular character shang chi  i think marvel succeeds again in the casting department as simu liu delivers on making me believe that this guy is a top tier martial artist  i also think simu gives a good performance during the more emotional moments as well  his chemistry with awkwafina who plays shang chi's friend katy is great too  the banter between shang chi and katy is some of the funniest scenes and makes me believe that those two were friends for years  however  tony leung who plays the main villain wenwu (the real mandarin) is the one that steals the show  tony leung is just phenomenal as he can convey the exact emotions of his character just through body language alone  it is just masterful acting  my biggest worry with mcu origin movies is that the villains are lacklustre but shang chi does not fall into this  wenwu is very sympathetic but also extremely fearsome  he is also the father of shang chi which makes the conflict between them feel more meaningful and tragic  wenwu is not a straight up evil person as he does still have good in him and i like that unfortunately  shang chi suffers from having the 3 villain problem  razorfist played by florian is wenwu's henchman and he doesn't get any backstory  i don't mind him that much though as he is mostly there to chase shang chi like a 007 henchman  there is also a scene where he does seem visibly worried about wenwu's health which gives him some character depth  on the other hand  the 3rd villain death dealer who is a mysterious assassin of wenwu is a massive disappointment  he looks very cool and visibly distinct from other ten ring members and is relevant to shang chi's past but amounts to absolutely nothing moreover  there is also a 3rd hero to shang chi and katy with shang chi's sister xialing played by meng'er zhang  she doesn't get enough interactions with shang chi  katy or her father wenwu and that feels like a waste  it's a shame as her interactions with both shang chi and katy are enjoyable and she also doesn't interact with her dad wenwu which is just a missed opportunity for her character  the movie also has a pacing issue as it slows down significantly in the second act  it just featured a lot of talking  exposition and flashbacks which i felt could have been cut down by a couple of minutes overall  shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is the all asian cast movie i have been waiting for  it delivers on the action  story and characters while being an exciting new addition to the mcu  i can't wait to see more of shang chi and finally get to see an asian in the avengers team ",Positive
289,before seeing this movie  i had zero expectations  went in blind  and it became one of the best marvel movies i've seen in a long time  it's very well written  which is uncommon in disney/marvel movies; it's well directed and the actors all did a fantastic job  every single actor was good  and none made me cringe  as plenty of mcu characters usually do because they're written by bad writers i'm not a fan of awkwafina  but she was wonderful  and i actually felt emotional connections to characters  the runtime was ideal  and the entire production design was incredible  as was the cgi  which made this into an epic martial arts experience  i enjoyed this movie from start to finish because it's not a regular marvel/superhero flick  it's a real adventure  one of the few mcu movies i might rewatch once or twice very recommendable ,Positive
290,if you rarely are disappointed with marvel films  and you consider yourself a big fan of them  then you will most likely enjoy this film  it's certainly better than a few of the last installments (by a small margin)  but this film is proof to all others that there really aren't any fresh ideas anymore  and the marvel antics are getting rather boring you have good guy who is lackluster in personality  has some family issues  turns out he's a very important guy in the world  has some impressive abilities which he hones  discovers things about himself  has someone close to him betray him  has to make some big decisions  engages in climactic fight  the end these movies are so cookie cutter  all marvel is now  is predictable pomp and circumstance with flashy lights and some  not many  redeeming qualities  let's start with those first:choreography  there are some slick nasty moves in most of the fight scenes  action scenes  and entertaining fights is certainly one thing marvel rarely disappoints humor  another typical trait of a marvel film  you get some good chuckles here and there  however without awkwafina  this trait would be almost non existent  and this is coming from someone who usually doesn't care for the smarky humor of the latest generations  but she is rather funny without being too annoying and sarcastic special effects and cinematography  solid work  obviously they didn't downsize their sfx department  but compared to the bar set by previous movies in the marvel world  it's not all that impressive on to the unflattering traits:story  woof  predictable through and through  don't expect much of anything here  they could easily have held a writing competition at any average middle school for the students to write a basic action movie script  and the storyline for this film would have probably been the entry from the kid who won 3rd place characters  aside from a a select few  the characters are as flat as a pancake in a hydraulic press the humor and the action  while i mentioned this earlier as a pro  over time  it all got old towards the end  the attempts at humor starting falling short of the goal  and the action became stale it's about time to wrap up this dynasty of marvel movies and move onto something else before it starts to smell like discarded scraps of reused ideas  and accumulate maggots of banality ,Positive
291,i can only give 6/10 because its not up to expectations as the other marvel movies  the ads were good but on a real movie  its totally lost that excitement  scifi effect is not that good because this is year 2021 but it is only year 2000 standard! the story is not that nice  can be better as i see it  directorship is not up to blockbuster standard the main actors are not that very good  only tony and michelle were ok  the actor bens kingsley and his stories are all crap  lots of the martial arts were crap  unprofessional up to marvel standards the ads and the movie really dont match on the qualities ,Positive
292,it was hard to believe that destin daniel cretton directed this film  which is a complete contrast from his previous work  tony leung chiu wai was the only reason to watch this movie if you aren't a sucker for superhero movies  shang chi proves scorcese's point on marvel movies despite being surprisingly entertaining it was good to see a major blockbuster from a non usa centric point of view  shang chi's best movements are it's timed humour and martial arts fight scenes  the ending of the movie is a theme park ride with eye soaring vfx of two dragons which are supposedy fighting but we don't know it due to excess use of colour on the whole shang chi is a typical summer blockbuster which is bound to entertain all demographics but it's linear storyline and under utilisation of tony leung chiu wai's talent is a bit underwhelming ,Positive
293,"masaki kobayashi was a pacifist  the celebrated japanese filmmaker  best known for ""the human condition""  took the unusual and daring position of denouncing his country's military actions during wwii  somehow  kobayashi got ""the thick walled room"" financed  and pushed it past the censors  even though it broached the largely taboo subject of war crimes  set in an american detention center  war veterans express guilt and remorse  and most importantly  hold themselves accountable for their actions  ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings""  directed by dustin daniel cretton  is evocative of kobayashi's ideology circumlocutorily by referencing ""kwaidan""  in particular  ""the woman of the snow""  the second in a quartet of ghost stories  which was the filmmaker's only foray into genre; the horror movie  xu wenwen(tony leung)  aka ""the mandarin""  a warmonger blessed with everlasting life  learns the whereabouts of ta lo  a village secreted away behind thick foliage  it's people know how to fight like gods  surviving the ambulatory trees that claim the xu's discovery party  he encounters li(fala chen)  the divine martial arts' most experienced practitioner  his future wife  in what can only be described as a grindhouse meet cute  whereas the mandarin harnesses his power through the ten rings  li only needs her bare hands to win the battle with relative ease  without the ten rings(nunchucks being its closest analogue)  the mandarin is no bruce lee  whose hands they say  as the legend goes  were unregistered lethal weapons  inexplicably  li falls in love with this psychopath  whose penchant for violence rivals the joker from ""kwaidan""  for starters  the filmmaker  having the advantage of cgi in his tool kit  draws out the plant life's malevolent subtext  in which its lunging movement towards the two woodcutters  caught in a terrible snowstorm  seems not only a condition of the wild winds  but an innate cognition to do them bodily harm  the trees are sitting ducks  the trees can't defend themselves from the woodcutters' axes  they're lives are dependent on the woman of the snow  a glacial apparition whose arctic breath entombs men in ice  the ""yuki onna""(keiko kishi) blows on mosaku(jun hamamura)  one of the woodcutters  as he sleeps in an abandoned hut  it's a superpower that any villain in the marvel universe would regard with a modicum of awe  the surviving woodcutter witnesses the older man's killing and expects the same ignominious end result  but when the woman gets a closer look at minokichi(tatsuya nakadai)  she is smitten  indicated by an elusive smile  and ends up citing his handsomeness and youth as reasons for her charity  clearly  the woman of the snow is lonely  her achilles heel; the ultimate cougar  who must be at least a thousand plus years his senior  in ""shang chi""  it's more clear cut that li is abdicating her duty to defend ta lo from potential marauders  choosing personal happiness over communal obligation  harder to glean  but not too hard  yuki onna also has deep seated commitments  a sort of mother nature  but militant  her job is to fend off those who wish to shorten the lives of flora and fauna; she's a warrior for the natural world  trees will fell unchallenged by the axes of future woodcutters  similar to how the tai lo villagers die in war waged by wen wu and his army  each respective woman chose love over duty;

294,"i'm honestly conflicted rating this film  on one side  disney introduced chinese culture and myths to the world; on another side  this is like watching amateur 70s wu xia (check wikipedia) in disney's gigantic budget  which means bad story   big action   expensive special effects   expensive experienced supporting actors   new comer hero  the result is still a bad big budget movie that solely rely on ""marvel"" brand and disney's money to conquer china's box office the story is poorly written and not even try to be more creative  i would prefer to see this as a 6 to 10 1 hour limited tv series to further develop the characters  as it is  the burden went to tony leung too much without even giving his character room to grow  so yes  i agree this was disney and marvel 1st co experimental film together (disney's first was mulan which at least a little better looks like mcu is currently a money mining exploitation using marvel brand and disney ",Positive
295,my brain it trembles i could not fathom such excitement and follow up it was too much  my senses are on fire right now  the story line fits in well too well and will continue with the avengers marvel studio sure does know how to keep it's fan rooting for more marvelous stuff and shang ohh that guy was impressive to the very end his sister the new boss was also awesome in fact this movie is on an awesome level of entertainment  gosh so high right now the movie is too much ,Positive
296,the plot was averagely old hat and covered ground that has been well trodden before  the film relied far to much on cgi which imo which detracted from the film  not the best marvel film ,Positive
297,"a marvel legend has risen and it only took 40 years to become an overnight sensation ""kim's convenience"" star simu liu breathes life into the title character who's changed his birth name to shaun what a stretch when you don't want to be found by your estranged dad  xu wenwu otherwise known as the mandarin  played by tony chiu wai leung (in his first american film) who has more rings than ringo starr or the olympics what can i say this guy loves his bling rapper/actor awkwafina is his bff  katy together shaun goes out of his way to avoid bringing back the dead with his wisecracking ""crazy rich asian"" girlfriend in tow simu was so intent of getting this gig that back in 2018 he tweeted marvel for the role kung fu fans are in for a solid 2 hour plus fight spectacular  which doesn't stop too long to draw breath this movie never gets boring it's action  adventure and fantasy all rolled into one thrill ride straight out of the marvel universe i kind of half expected 80's singer  limahl to crank out ""never ending story"" in the final act of this epic movie thanks to one of the legendary creatures hiding out in a mythical village not unlike shangri la from 1937's classic ""lost horizon"" car maker bmw clearly have a product placement deal with producer  kevin feige they are driven  crushed or smashed in every automobile scene hawaiian director  destiny daniel cretton  best known for ""just mercy"" and ""the glass castle"" does a marvellous job with the screen play and screen story he helped write based on the source material from marvel comics steve engelhart and jim starlin this movie idea has been floating around since the 80's when the late stan lee wanted bruce lee's son  brandon to play the lead  but that plan fell through australia actually played a huge part in this movie finally being produced despite world war c's best attempt in 2020 to shut down production watch out for: michelle yeoh plus aussies ronnie chieng  lynette curran and lydia sarks (from the toyota commercials) as the hilarious flight attendant like all good marvel movies there is an easter egg worth waiting for before the cinema lights come on and the curtains close on the big screen and just like the movie this review doesn't mention the title till the final frame  ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" do yourself a favour and take the family to see the 25th film in the marvel cinematic universe which is full of surprises and cameos mcu's first with an asian leading superhero protagonist!",Positive
298,"great action film that probably has the most tenuous links to the greater marvel universe than any film before it i guess this is just a glimpse into the eastern aimed branch of the marvel monster no real mention to the blip other than a glimpse of a poster on a wall in san francisco at the start of the movie
but apart from being a little flat on a plot line this is a great action movie and would stand alone without the backing of the behemoth franchise ",Positive
299,one of the real standouts for me in the movie was the fights scenes  the mcu is not really known for having interesting fight scenes and really most of them are just bland and cliché but shang chi brought something new and i loved it  every single fight scene was so well done and paced super well and destin daniel cretton  who directed this  did an amazing job directing the fight scenes in this movie  the fight scenes in this movie were probably the best part especially since you can tell that all of the actors in this movie  especially simu liu  did most of the stunt work themselves  it's also insane to think that other than this movie simu liu has only really acted in one other thing but you could barely tell  he played shang chi so well and brought so much emotion that everybody can easily relate to and love him  honestly  everybody did an amazing job acting in this movie and i have to say i was skeptical with awkwafina  who plays katy  but she proved me wrong  but for me  the real scene stealer was tony chiu wai leung  who plays xu wenwu  as the villain  the villains in marvel movies are mediocre at best but he decided to change that with this movie  xu wenwu was such an intriguing villain that the audience can easily sympathize with and relate to him  the cinematography in this movie is gorgeous to look at and you can see the detail that was put into it  depending on where the movie is at the lighting reflects that area  i will say though is that this movie has a bit of slower pacing that at times does work in its favour but in other parts  i very much was wanting the movie to hurry up  in the end  shang chi is such a heartfelt marvel movie that does have some issues but is still enjoyable ,Positive
300,"i had some high expectations to this movie and i was really excited with the fact that this was the first marvel movie with it's majority of the cast being asian  which shouldn't be a surprise given the story context but unfortunately from the standards that american cinema have set in the past  it is  and even better  include some non english dialogue to make things more authentic  i do hope they continue to make more diverse adaptions from comics since the world of entertainment will for sure thrive on this!the movie as some fantastic fighting sequences  high praise for the stunt team  the fighting scenes are indeed a delight to watch and at the beginning the story is engaging  with some fun cameos throughout however as the story unfolds things start to take a different turn the first thing that threw me off was the visual effects  i mean the fighting sequence on the bus was a very promising one  starting off great but then it just became weird and i had the exact same feeling when watching the black widow   how does a 100 plus million dollar movie has cgi this crappy? the standards i got used to from a marvel perspective are way higher than the floppy cgi shown in a lot of the scenes  some worst than others yet i couldn't get pass that then the story and its pace    i mention this in most marvel movies  i am of course aware these are purse fantasy  but with all the connection made between the super heroes now  it's impossible not to compare them since they are living in the ""same universe""  for shang chi the fantasy becomes obvious from start  which was fine  however things escalate  to the point where on the third act it seems i am no longer seeing a marvel movie but rather a kid's adaption to a tale that takes place somewhere in ancient asia it's fun but it seems that i watched 2 different stories under the same movie and the pace is just too fast  all of the characters who led fairly normal lives (specially the supporting character) absorb all of this magical new world as if it was ""another regular day"" i didn't feel much engagement to the main character  although the storyline was somehow interesting there's a lack of charisma in most actors (with some exceptions from the villain and from the aunt without giving much spoilers) once again i am all up that they continue to make diverse movies but this one didn't work for me ",Positive
301,first thing first is the cast in shang chi is excellent  every performance is great and the chemistry between shang and katie is excellent  i am so glad the movie did not create a forced love interest plot between the two friends  a few of the action sequences are good and better than what we received in black widow  the bus fight scene in the first third of the movie in particular is a standout 45 minutes into the movie when shang chi is reunited with his father i was bored beyond belief until the last act of the movie  the film switches gears and continuously dumps exposition on the audience  everything from here becomes the predictable hero needs to accept his true self story we have seen a million times  which is a shame because the first act of the movie seemed so fresh from what we typically get with mcu movies  the fight in the last act  while entertaining  are the typical cgi mess found in marvel movies  the one on one between shang and his father was genuinely emotional  but once you add all the cgi dragons/monsters it becomes a mind numbing bore another thing that bothers me is the character development  excellent performances aside none of the characters go through any deep growth  the story plays out exactly how you would expect with training montages  green screen vistas and humor ruining any moments of tension  for example  katie seems to be unnecessarily dragged into everything  learns archery in a few hours  survives a vicious battle and hits the monster right in the neck from who knows how far away  it makes my eyes roll into the back of my head thinking about it  the same thing can be said about shang's sister  the heart wrenching conflict between her and shang is quickly resolved and there is no character development for her  it's all nonsense and i need a little more substance with my flashy action all my gripes aside i was entertained in spurts watching shang chi because of the chemistry between it's stars and some decent action scenes  which makes it all the more frustrating that is falls into the typical mcu formula after it's first act  marvel take some freaking risks with your story telling please!,Positive
302,"visually  one of the most beautiful movies in mcu  more than that  one of the best solo super hero movies in mcu  a grand feat for a debut  even more so without other superheroes like ""crutch""  the performances make justice for the script  showing us that end game  contrary to what was believed  wasn't the end of marvel era  the phase 4 promises be even greater than others  this quality can be easily compared to black panter and captain america and the winter soldier level engaging and with the right dose between comedy and battle  the film has impressive fight choreographies the credit scenes make connection between the shang chi story to the mcu in a curious way  can't wait to see what feige is planning for the future ",Positive
303,we watched the film on disney+ and it blew our minds away  i like the cast  simu liu is awesome as shang chi and he nails every action sequence  awkwafina is hilarious and she saves the film with all the humor parts but the action and fight sequences are perfect  michelle yeoh is great in the film and i've seen her in films like tomorrow never dies and the mummy: tomb of the dragon emperor  the special effects are beautiful to see and this what makes the mcu very cool  i've seen martial art films from bruce lee  jackie chan  jet li and donnie yen  i love martial art films and superhero films  all two types of films combined into one ,Positive
304,the special effects in a fantasy movie are all  it seems to see shaolin soccer where at least the drama  director  and actors well knew to build a hilarious comedy the effects here are tragi comic and at a very childish level i fell asleep 2 3 times despite a huge surround system with 7 1 audio channels at max power ,Positive
305,a simple yet surprisingly decent marvel flick that pays tribute to chinese culture authentically with western twists  as an asian  the most wondrous part of shang chi's cinematic journey is the inclusion of chinese mythical creatures created with world class cg  the action scenes are also reminiscent of the top hong kong martial arts movies  you have to remember that this is a marvel studios movie  so do temper your expectation for the storyline a little  its more style over substance  my biggest gripe is the casting  we've been waiting to see asian super heroes on a global stage  i just find it hard to believe that it is liu simu who has very little charisma  and seems way out of his league for this big of a role  awkwafina provides great comedy relief  and is a fantastic addition to the marvel universe  i also find it unfair for the asian community that she is built to be the love interest  is it this difficult to sexualize asians in hollywood?,Positive
306,for the latest flick in the mcu shang chi  it's magnificently assembled with a stellar cast like 'crazy rich asians' stars awkwafina and michelle yeoh combined with an interesting performance of tony leung as wenwu (aka the mandarin)  simu liu as the lead is a welcoming addition to the marvel family with his martial arts skills and adds more to this ever growing universe the visuals  the fight choreography  and an interesting soundtrack to boot! it makes you think this is more like a martial arts fantasy film rather than a typical marvel movie  the metaphorical pandora's box also plays a role in the film's plot as it has a moral about truth and consequence  i even took notice of the moral values and quirks usually seen in asian families that it began to remind me of the most recent film crazy rich in a way in terms of valuing your heritage and roots  but learning that your past doesn't dictate what you should become many years later at 2019 san diego comic con  simu liu spoke about what it's like to be part of marvel  he was so humble to speak of it  after what i've seen in this movie  it makes sense on why he said at the panel of him citing black panther's chadwick boseman (respect) as an influence in taking on this lead role  chadwick helped open that door for him  he took it  and made it his own for audiences who look like him after all that's transpired in the mcu since 2008  i can't wait to see where else shang chi will go next from here  i recommend it ,Positive
307,the first stand alone film featuring an asian american superhero  shang chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences  all the actors and especially simu liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows  with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in san francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in macau  the standouts  another wonderful new addition to the mcu world and hopefully this paves the way for more ethnicities being represented in the universe as time goes on  highly recommended  a must watch  overall the movie is great  the soundtrack is spectacular  the fights are amazing and i had fun watching it ,Positive
308,didn't feel until the credits that it's a marvel movie  by comparing it to other marvel movies  it ranks among the lowest in terms of vfx  story and acting  trying so hard to be epic with lots of replays and plot holes  however it had great stunts and action sequences ,Positive
309,"shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is an entertaining albeit formulaic popcorn marvel film that's part family drama and part kung fu adventure that is raised by tony leung's villainous performance as wenwu  it delivers a solid introduction to an asian american superhero while paying tribute to chinese martial arts films first off  it's very pleasing to see the warm reception shang chi has received across the world  it's a phenomenon to see english speaking audiences intensely cheering for a subtitled film that has large portions in mandarin  back in my university days  the average western filmgoer typically would not see a foreign subtitled movie on the account of not wanting ""to read a movie "" look at how much the world has changed now the first half of shang chi plays much stronger  the san francisco bus sequence is reminiscent of a hollywood big budgeted version of 90's jackie chan films set in western locales  like rumble in the bronx  who am i or first strike the fight choreography moves from hard fisticuffs towards fantastical wuxia  and plunges into more and more cgi  the former is more engaging with shang chi being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time in a real setting simu liu does a solid job as shang chi and has impressive moves  like an athlete  he sells the hits and moves swiftly when performing parkour  liu grew on me throughout the movie  much to the aid of the always charismatic awkwafina as his best friend katy  they share a charming banter as if they were doubling as their own r2 d2 and c 3po the film's mvp is tony leung  who approaches his role with an award worthy intensity  injecting a depth and gravitas to his villain that elevates the film to another level i was amazed by the depth leung achieved through his scenes  the scene that struck me was a flashback where tony leung's wenwu comes home through his door and gives a look of concern to his own family  in that one glance  leung portrays a completely different person in contrast to the villain in the present  his performance cut right through me and i felt i was watching someone suffer it is unfortunate as wenwu is undercut by the script introducing a second villain late in the second half  which diminishes leung's character  wenwu is established as an immortal who's fought for power through the ages  yet there's a lack of wisdom in his latter actions that felt unconvincing shang chi's third act takes a strange turn into mythic realms and loses the gravitas that was promised in the first act  the story shifts into a westerner's stereotypical view of china  we get the straw hats  the rice paddy village that looks cambodian  and the constant mention of dragons  with a cgi infused finale spectacle  the movie then exhausts all the good will earned from the first half shang chi is entertaining marvel fare that will be remembered best as a cultural zeitgeist icon for asian american representation  however  as a film  i don't feel the need to revisit it anytime soon  when i will  it will be for the san francisco section and tony leung scenes i am asian  not asian american  i'm happy for other asian americans who feel represented by shang chi  i personally do not feel that representation from this film and am fine with that  looking at the film itself  i admit shang chi is one great step in the asian american representation fight  however  it's apparent there's still a heck of a long way to go   ",Positive
310,visually this movie is a treat to watch  from action to its sound effects this movie gives spectacular performances in it's own style  acting performances by all the cast are amazing  story is unique & different not a great one but it fits quite well  marvel has done his magic again with shang chi as this movie is well made and reach all the spectaculations in it  i hope people like this movie and praise it because it's really that good and yess don't miss the credit scenes because marvel has a habit to hid the surprise after the movie     ,Positive
311,although it gets a bonus point for not being totally driven by cgi having said that  the cgi fights are  again  obviously fake  and i would suggest that any actor with only one name should never be employed  they will almost certainly be wrong for the movie better than some marvel movies  about the same as the others  you know what you are getting ,Negative
312,i was super excited for this film and at the start of the year it was probably my most anticipated film of the year  it definitely did not disappoint me! this film is massive fun  massive action and has massive heart  the action scenes are so cool and the choreography is amazing in the fight scenes and the martial arts look so good  i love the jokes between the two main characters and the banter they have together is great fun  this is a good way to do an origin film this far into the mcu  it sort of flicks between flash backs and the present day and it keeps the pacing of the film fresh and quick  shang chi as a character isn't super well known but just like the guardians of the galaxy i think he will become a household name  the shots in this film are gorgeous at times and have some beautiful bright colours and amazing chinese settings  some of the effects fail a little bit but it's not enough to harm the film at all  i loved this film and i'm so happy to be back into the marvel universe once again!,Positive
313,"i can tell you the reason to see this film is solely based on the performance of the incredible hong kong actor tony leung as shang chi's father wenwu aka the real mandarin  he literally carried this film on his back  for those who aren't film buffs  tony leung is basically leonardo dicaprio  tom hanks  denzel washington and brad pitt combined in hong kong  even though hollywood has knocked on his door a few times  finally  better late than never  he gets his due in hollywood simu liu throughout most of the film  i thought was alright  nothing too special  nothing too terrible  however  he has two incredible moments in the film where then i was completely sold on his character  a great display of acting  one of which involves a scene with tony leung where he calls out his failure as a parent  what i also admired is that shang chi also has blood on his hands  he reveals this to awkwafina's katy and simu doesn't overdo his performance in that scene  you felt his anger  his guilt and his remorse  this reveal reminded me he almost killed the death dealer  seeing and knowing this makes his character a bit more rich and complex  i appreciated that he wasn't a saint the relationship between shang chi and his father wenwu on the surface does involve superhero theatrics  however underneath it  it does have a very relatable dynamic  as an asian myself  i think it will hit home to most asians and their relationship with their parents but despite all that  i did not love the film like i wanted to  it still falls under the same old formulaic humor i despise  mainly coming from awkwafina  i will however concede that i did expect the humor to be a lot worse and thankfully it isn't too unbearable  but if it were up to me  ""less is more "" i had some inkling that sir ben kingsley would show up and he does add the redundant humor into the mix although it works on some level  the story mainly lumbers along  obsessed with backstory  on the one hand i did feel the drag  but in the other i felt the flashbacks did help flesh out wenwu  shang chi and his sister xialing whom meng'er zhang does a good job portraying  fala chen also had a great supporting role as shang chi's mother while the creatures showcased in final act are pretty cool like the great protector  i particularly disliked morris the faceless chicken pig that accompanied ben kingsley's trevor slattery and found the addition very unnecessary  speaking of unnecessary florian munteanu's razor fist was not needed  i felt all his screen time could have been devoted to the death dealer who i was more interested in i also did feel like they took some tropes and traditions of asian cinema and did not present anything unique on their own take and in doing so i got this feeling that at least half of the film did not know what it wanted to be other than an asian american hero in the mcu to sum it up  a stellar first half  where then marvel eventually goes back into their comfort zone by the third act  despite tony leung's magic as a performer and simu liu's best efforts it is ultimately another okay entry to the mcu as opposed to the top tier level films that took big swings like infinity war  the first iron man  the captain america trilogy or the first guardians  again  being an asian myself i wanted to love this film  but i didn't  i just thought it was okay two post credits scenes so stay put 7/10 ",Positive
314,"overall: 91/100this is more geared towards non marvel people than for the marvel people quick & dirty: i loved it and would highly recommend seeing this film in theatres  visually stunning  fantastic fight scenes  great story  and emotionally driven  due to one too many lulls perhaps a slight bit too long in length  but overall  very enjoyable when i was teen i loved watching asian films such as ""crouching tiger  hidden dragon""  ""house of flying daggers""  & ""ong bak""  this film had the great martial arts fighting sequences that the aforementioned films had  i felt like i was a kid again enjoying something fresh and new  i also fully enjoyed the combination of mandarin (apologies if that's wrong) and english  a movie with subtitles always reminds me that there's more than the bubble of north american film the acting was great  michelle yeoh was the one who stole the show for me at the end of the day  again  it reminded of the good old days of martial arts movies that depended on the actors to make things believable instead of lots of cgi i watch virtually zero marvel movies and so if you're iffy on whether to watch this or not it shouldn't stop you from enjoying this film  it's funny  action packed  and does not appear to be culturally inappropriate  the acting is great and the length of the film  while a little long  is still exceptional ps    there are two after the credits scenes so make sure you have time sit until the very end enjoy the show!",Positive
315,they certainly picked the right director for this film; he seemed to understand that this script has a plot with too many generic elements and characters that are just serviceable  so  he really put forth the effort to craft stunningly choreographed  smoothly filmed action sequences that kept me more than engaged additionally  this movie has some refreshing bursts of imagination throughout  including introducing us to the marvel land of pokémon it's certainly better than black widow ,Positive
316,i have nothing negative to say about this movie it's perfect  highly entertaining and fun  action packed  emotional  great story telling and comedic as well! awesome post credit scenes as well! can't wait for the second one!!,Positive
317,as far as marvel being a fantasy film they generally like to be grounded in reality of history of the world and the current setting    but this one is really really going into the fantasy setting of parallel universes of chinese myth  so for me it kinda felt totally fantastical and not really connected to any of the other marvel universe the fight and chorography of the action scenes is impressive and entertaining and if a movie could be watched on that basis alone then this would do the job   unfortunately for shang chi you actually need a compelling story with interesting characters     but what we got was the massively overdone    evil father and son who seeks redemption arc    other supporting characters were pretty much all one dimensional   either good or bad  black or white i also felt that samuel liu was miscast in the main role    if donnie yen was younger he probably would have done a better job  samuel just does not have the screen presence its entertaining for the kids but i think the adults will be bored ,Positive
318,shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is quite frankly my favourite marvel movie since the original iron man  while many fans check out or get excited for a new marvel movie simply because they like the series  i was stoked for this one because my cousin gene day worked as an artist on the comic book series that this is based on master of kung fu  he was and artist on the series from issue 76 120 and co created the character of death dealer who features in this movie  i had high expectations for this film because of my family connection and it didn't disappoint  stunning visuals and exciting stunts elevate this film  while there are chanes from the original comics  these changes make sense and still fit within the overall scheme of the marvel universe  shang chi's father in the originals was fu manchu but since marvel no longer owns the rights to the character  it makes sense to pick another strong asian villain like the mandarin to take his place  overall a great addition to the marvel universe ,Positive
319,shang chi inovates in marvel cinematic universe with amazing action choreography that will keep you invested at all times ,Positive
320,"positive:
the characters are all extremely well done and acted to perfectionthe story is gripping and is paced very wellin my opinion the best action of any mcu movievillain was one of the best in the mcunegative:
in traditional mcu fashion they use comedy at improper times and it takes away from some important momentsthe idea that katy could hit that shot is bullthe cameo of trevor/mandarin was very overusedthe henchmen's motives are unclear8 5/10 ",Positive
321,i'm from hong kong  having watched crazy rich asian  i went into this having very low expectations  but it really surprises me how good it is  the storyline is intense  love the mandarin dialogue  the amazing natural scenery  tony leung's charisma  the occasional humor  kitty and shaun's pure friendship  it's kinda empowering and touching to see people i watched growing up in a marvel movie being able to accurately represent our own culture wish awkwafina could have learnt and spoken mandarin tho ,Positive
322,this is just a by the book  no surprises  marvel movie  at the beginning it looked like it was almost made to be a tv show as the cgi compared to reality was quite noticeable  not sure who thought this was the best fighting movie they have ever scene as to me  it would barely crack the top 5  it was still a fun movie overall but i don't think it would have been as well received in a normal non covid world compared to black panther  it's really hard to tell based off box office gross  i hope there is more to come ,Positive
323,it's not your typical super hero movie  in fact it doesn't feel like a marvel movie at all  but more of fantasy movie it's got non stop action  plenty of fights  martial arts  magic  mythical creatures and dragons!what's not to like?,Positive
324,"""you can't outrun who you really are"" 60/100what shang chi and the legend of the ten rings provides  besides a really long title  would be considered an exceedingly new perspective of what the mcu can offer  it's one of those marvel movies that  despite its defects  stands out from most superhero films  something almost impossible to do these days   marvel has a reputation of creating great origin stories for its characters  at least establish the basics of them  orderly making the audience sympathize with them  shang chi is no exception  it establishes the future role of this character and its importance on the mcu  but a deeper analysis into his past must be needed in order to make him go through the good ol' hero's journey  something that the movie tried to accomplish  but was left incomplete while trying to prioritize some plot points that's another thing with this film: a sense of incompletion  it tries to set up so many aspects and characters that  it forgets to conclude anything :/  the final act doesn't help either; having some of the most horrible looking cgi i've ever seen in a marvel proyect and tiktok worthy green screen effects maybe the character of shang chi will leave me a better taste in my mouth as we see more of him in the future but  right now  it feels like a bumpy start to the introduction of a promising character also  the funny tones hit surprisingly well      huh  who would've thought i would say that about a marvel film    ",Positive
325,story is balanced   contains multiple dark topics and dark events but it has strong comedy vibes too  and finally  a movie where trailer didn't betray all the story  it has even some magic in it  recommended to all fans of kung fu and to all fans of harry potter ,Positive
326,tune in for the action scenes and cinematography; stay for simu liu as the star with charm and heart  excellent casting choices (except for one) and a story that felt about as real as it can as a superhero backstory i went back and forth whether to rate it a 7 or an 8  i'll definitely watch it again  so 8 it is michelle yeoh is always great and awkwafina (who i don't always enjoy) was terrific too the ben kingsley role (yeah that's the clunker i mentioned above) was goofy and unnecessary  as was his bizarre companion (jarjar binks anyone?)  but  oh well  the occasional slip into goofy comedy makes the film uneven  but easy to forgive with all the talent on screen some complained about the exposition scenes  which are many  but for me with no background on shang chi  i liked it and appreciated that the backstory was not a carbon copy of other heroes interesting tie in with the next marvel phase  the creature design and special effects were mostly top notch the other plot point i found odd was shang chi's mother falling in love with a centuries old amoral killer  didn't make sense based on her background or village's culture i held off watching this because i thought it might slide into exploitation or focus too much on representation  but it did what good movies do: good story good actors well directed  i'm glad i watched it  i enjoyed it a lot ,Positive
327,i enjoyed this more than black widow  black widow wasn't bad  but when you've had two great spider man's  a fantastic captain america or two and the amazing infinity war    well black widow just seems meh but why are we talking about that when now we have shang chi to give it's complete title that would also include the legend of the 10 rings overall i enjoyed this but the pity is the weak and predictable ending  the obligatory 2 end credit scenes are also there where it excels is the first 2/3rds  it has a very spider man feel to it in the sense of easy going humour  the fight scenes are great    although some seem simply contrived to show off martial arts being performed in a different to the usual place martial arts films usually have their fights     but then jackie chan films have been doing this stuff decades ago  still fun though there are some neat touches involving referencing characters introduced in other marvel films which adds a different dimension and pleases some of the fan base but ultimately  it all winds up like a million other big budget fighting the monster in the end of film blockbuster  lots of bangs  exposition  non sensical ott fight scenes and a little perplexing how we even got here it suffers from sugar coated neatness after all  this film starts well with some dark tones along the way but ends up being too neat  like a moral compass advert for how ideally one's life can be redeemed by not being a dick for a few seconds still as popcorn movies go (and boy have we missed them these past two years)  this is perfectly serviceable nowhere on par with the two recent spideys  in fact  i'ld say if you can hold out till it gets to disney+ next month (october 2021)  watch it then for nothing more as it's included with your subscription i must say  marvel (disney) are churning out same ole same ole    nothing new whereas dc are knocking it out the park     first with the excellently unsettling joker and the recent the suicide squad  with the batman possibly delivering on it's riddler promise  we may have a shift back to dc in terms of power balance  this is surprising to me as dc have churned out some proper crud over the years i wish the scripts pushed the envelope by telling interesting  engaging and intelligent stories unfortunately  there really is nothing original or revealing about shang chi  it's a safe film  fun but ultimately forgettable ,Positive
328,another marvel comics movie  this one takes one of their lesser known characters  martial artist shang chi  and gives him a film of his own this is not a jumping on point to marvel movies  as pre knowledge of some other ones will help shang chi lives in america  he has a past he thought he left behind  he enjoys karaoke with his best friend (awkwafina) and he just lives  he has martial arts movie posters on his bedroom wall but then his past catches up with him and he is forced to fight  head across the world  discover his past  and his destiny   like the black panther film  this does a good job of showing this world outside of america  it's very stylish in representing it's culture and has some great art direction  it does manage to get a lot of exposition in without being overwhelmed by it  which is not something all comic book movies that have to do that manage awkwafina is quite entertaining playing a character who could easily be very annoying  the first action set piece is terrific  original gripping and really well done and all in all  it does succeed by being a little bit different to what has come before there is an entertaining surprise as well  which succeeds in doing some good continuity minor quibbles: it's ten minutes too long  my attention did wander during some of the quieter moments and scenes of people talking  one flashback is a bit extraneous  the character of his sister ends up being rather underused and outside of the first set piece i mentioned  they forgot to put any other bits of jeopardy in here  of the other two set pieces  the first doesn't carry any because you don't believe people are going to get hurt  and the final big battle set piece is yet another of these  we've seen them all many times now  and even though this has some different elements  it's still too same old same old but all in all an entertaining watch  and those who like their martial arts movies  or who like to pretend to do such things when watching fight scenes  will be entertained do as ever keep watching to the very end of the closing credits for a couple of extra scenes ,Positive
329,shang chi is action/fantasy cinema peaking  it is beautiful and so well choreographed i can hardly wrap my head around it  it is powerful and elegant and strong  this was a very awesome world to walk into for 2 hours  cannot wait for the next installment ,Positive
330,after a brief gap of theatrical release (not considering black widow as it had a partial release)  marvel is back in theatres introducing to the characters of the new phase of their universe  shang chi the legend of ten rings is a standalone film but equally also serves as an important piece of puzzle in the events linking to the web series' and upcoming movies  it goes without saying that watching all the recently released series on disney+ is as important as following these movies in order as the trailer shows and also the name suggests shang chi is a movie whose action heavily lean towards the martial arts and individual battles  it is a different watch as compared to other marvel movies which involve a lot of hi tech dependent action  the movie hardly wastes any time on the lead character's introduction and straightway jumps into the 'purpose'  having experienced the 'blip' after the infinity war  the normal people aren't surprised anymore when supernatural things and high octane action happens around them  hence the character here is hardly wasting any time on hiding their identities from the public  the storyline is pretty straightforward and the movie has strong resemblance to black panther because of the lead character's connection to his place of origin  the action sequences are shot brilliantly and some of the camera and lighting work is mind blowing  the movie relies on good hand to hand combat almost until the climax and i believe if marvel had gone for an r rating  the action sequences would have been much better to watch  i personally think some incidents happening around climax were way too convenient  last but not the least  the background music just elevates most scenes into a whole new level simu liu has what it takes to bring the asian heritage to the superhero universe  the movie doesn't test much of his emotional side and i believe we will get to see more in the upcoming movies  tony leung shines in his powerful antagonist role and awkwafina drives the comical side of things as shang chi's close buddy who is almost a sidekick  rest of the cast have done a decent job and do look out for a surprise funny cameo ; )marvel expands its universe with shang chi by exploring a different culture and heritage in the superhero genre  it is a satisfying watch for a marvel fan and a great watch for any action movie fans ,Positive
331,you have to get past all of the chinese language parts at the beginning   but after that it gets really fun   action packed  and funny!!! awkwafina is fantastic! overall   lots of fun!!!,Positive
332,i waited a little longer to see this just because it wasn't anything i grew up with  i cannot believe the reviews are this mixed  it's more of a 9/10 but i gotta make up for the idiots  everything was explained well  it blended action  drama and comedy well  solid a ,neutral
333,this movie is worthy of praise  it truly represented the people  history and lore of the legend  early reports said this was the asian version of black panther and that could not be further from the truth  despite sales  black panther was hands down the worst film marvel released  until black widow snatched that crown  you get invested in these characters and had they cast a better side kick other than the unattractive  not funny  awkwafina i probably would have considered a 9 for the film  i don't know who blessed her with the asian female kevin hart title  but she is awful in everything  i hate her voice  hate acting and her face is 100% cabage patch i know nothing about these comics  but i truly want to know more about changs father and the legacy of the rings  i would assume that will be explored in the sequel  but again  the writer and director deserve praise for how they unfolded and told the story  phase 4 was not looking promising  but this was aa strong entry and worthy of the same praise iron man got  shang may be the new mcu poster boy  the pace probably could have been quickened  at 2:20  it was probably at least 10 minutes minimum too long that said  it's a great story  acted and directed well and the only irritant was awkwafina  comparing her to kevin hart is an insult to kevin  she is the asian female jerry lewis and that is one clown i could live a lifetime without having ever seen!,Negative
334,i love the story and the martial arts  this is definitely one of the best marvel movies so far and at leat in the top 5  on a serious note for all you non asians: not every asian likes karaoke  and i am one of them  ;),Positive
335,i liked this movie  one of the first american movie where a lot of the dialog is in chinese  the movie in it self is not fantastic but is has it's moments  i just can't stop thinking about why this hd to be set in the marvel universe  it makes no sense to me   but then i am no marvel fan  i think it would have been much better a completely chinese movie set in a different universe separate from marvel  but hey  this is an american movie after all ,Positive
336,"i loved the idea of shangi chi because it would bring chinese culture into the mcu  which i assumed meant they would explain how the myths were ""real world"" events  but instead you are left with more questions then answers for example with thor we learn that the ""gods"" powers are more or less what we on earth call science  but in this you see many normal chinese mythological stuff without explanation of how it works or more to the point    
(spoilers)
ok so some can control the wind it would seem  but how? is it just an magical power? where did it come from? how do you operate it?and the realm with the literal chinese mythological creatures     was it a realm on another planet? which one? i can accept the rings working because they are some sort of magic device  but thats about it  you are just thrown into a ride with no idea whats going on this all said  the movie felt out of place ",Positive
337,i adore everything asian and was pumped to experience this movie!and indeed  the asian elements in it were awesome   though (probably) somewhat westernized  i loved the obvious folklore creature  the dragon  i loved the chinese scenes  i loved the little cultural aspects the martial arts scenes were freaking beautiful! it's been long (if ever?) since i've seen such cool hand to hand combat  usually these mundane combat scenes bore me to death but when shang chi started fighting in the bus  i was so surprised at how cool it was!but other than that  i'm not sure if they really used the eastern setting to the full extent possible  the story was pretty meh  a desperate dad due to his dead wife teaches his children to be assassins and then later somehow attack them for little reason because he is clouded by a dark presence? meh also  what's even the deal with the ten rings? the movie is about the legend of the ten rings but the most explanation we've got from it was in the credit scene  doesn't feel fitting many other elements also felt cliche  illogical or too contrived for plot purposes  simply put  i feel like the overall story was very sloppy dan shi hai ke yi ba!,Positive
338,good cinematography  good cgi  script is ok some hilarious bits some corny bits great costume but besides tony leung  these american movies always choose the most unattractive chinese/asian actors and actresses by asian standards  there are so many more attractive more handsome actors than the one in this movie to choose from in hk and china or singapore but they chose this guy   it is almost as if they chose the most unattractive asian artists to make an american movie  why is that?reminds me in the olympics in tokyo  the media and american press chose the most unattractive ugly photos of the chinese athletes to print online  i wonder why is that? sounds like latent sinophobia out of all the actors only tony leung's performance was great  michelle yeows performance is always good but her roles so predictable so enjoyable to watch but could be better ,Positive
339,spoiler alert***** great film except the fact that they let his gf in on avenger business at the end  she trains one day with a bow and arrow  gets a lucky shot in the throat of a dragon and now she's avenger material? nahhhh     other than that  it was visually stunning and an action packed thrill ride ,Positive
340,its highly rated on release due to being essentially the asian equivalant of black panther but this time we got an asian superhero mc  now i'm not saying i hate the mc but i do hate his bestfriend  she is your cliche forced comedian trope who is funny maybe 2% in this entire film the plot is predictable ofc but thats a marvel movie for you for the most part  it just fell flat in my opinion  there is nothing in this movie that screams it should be a 7 or higher it could be because i'm not too crazy about martial art films but i still wanted to give it a try instead of completely ignoring it  i want to at least gives some points for them trying something new and not forcing diversity by changing characters race/etc overall probably a watch once and be done with it just so once he shows up in another avengers movie you'll know his backstory i guess ,Negative
341,shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is a great and spectacular movie that expands the mcu in many ways  it has plenty of memorable action  emotional and comedy sequences  with convincing characters and breathtaking fight choreographies and cgi  shang chi is a familiar but exciting superhero's origin story  that explores a new cultural ground in the mcu rating: 7 9 ,Positive
342,"""reel tunez: the radio show all about the movies"" movie review (9/8/21): ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings""first  when people on imdb rate a movie (though very good) a 9 or 10  i really want to ask ""so it's a 10   the very best movie ever   as good as ""sound of music""  ""gone with the wind""  ""oliver""  ""star wars"" and movies that probably do get a 9 or 10?? to me   yes   an excellent movie  but people skew the ratings by calling everything a 9 or 10  with that said  i'd give it between a 7 and 8 (which is very good)  but a little closer to a 7 (7 4) yet another marvel studio (disney) release to the marvel universe  i knew nothing about this movie and didn't really have a lot of interest in seeing it  but glad i did! it was fun   and it was exciting! excellent adventure movie that had great effects and great story line if you like adventure movies   even if you haven't followed the marvel universe  you really don't have to know the history of the other movies to enjoy this one i will add the following (which is not a spoiler): do not leave the movie until the very very last of the credits have rolled and they turn on the lights to clean the place  as the movie ends  we go into one last restaurant scene  then in the middle of the credits  we get more story  then after the last of the credits   even after ""marvel studio cleaning crew: bob the janitor and mae his wife""  we get one more scene at the end  these marvel extras are consistent and basically a clue into what comes next on a 1 10 scaled  i'd give this a very good 7 4! this is a big screen movie  so see it at the theater ",Positive
343,preferebly to watch in cinema  sound efects  fights  visual  everything is satisfy plot wasn't speciel  some cliche important scenes  most of in ending  new wakanda  funded asian culture and mytology good for watch with friends and marvel fandom ,Positive
344,the good news is shang chi still has lots of potential to be a great super hero movie  as if you accept this movie as his origin story ( which it is ) then it is a reasonable introduction into the marvel universe however when you compare this movie to the first movies starring captain america  captain marvel  iron man  thor  guardians of the galaxy  dr strange etc etc it is not as good an introduction but luckily those previous movies built a very strong foundation of course compared to the recent black widow ( 7 out of 10 ) & the eternals ( 5 out of 10 ) this is a bit of a concerning drop in quality of the marvel universe  however with more established marvel universe films coming out like the new dr strange  thor  black panther  the marvels ( feb 17 2023 )  guardians of the galaxy  ant man  captain america & eventually another shang chi etc after those the future looks good so let's hope the quality rises up again so yes the script could have been a bit better ( though the overall theme did just about come together ) & the over emphasis on comedy at the wrong times does miss the mark ( at the right times it hits the mark too to be fair ) so the decent script loses it a star ( as we expect it to be better )  then the movie does not have that much interest in it to make it re watchable ( as won't be adding it to my blu ray collection ) like other marvel movies do such as guardians of the galaxy ( which is the perfect example of using humour at the right times in the movie  but staying serious when the scene requires it too ) so the fact it is worth watching once because we want to see the super hero in future marvel movies is good  but it loses a star because i can't see why i would ever watch this movie again as it just does not capture it's audience finally the last star it loses making it still a decent 7 out of 10 movie so worth a watch  is there are too many convenient moments in the movie that make it bland & are designed to accentuate the supporting cast but not in a way that would be original  exciting or thought provoking ( which they deserved to have as the supporting cast were actually all good ) as the scenes the supporting cast get ( such as the awesome actor who is able to show that talent in other movies = ben kingsley ) are just not well written or directed well to make them stand out as really good as instead these filler moments do not add to the film like they should have done ( other marvel movies are much more clever with these scenes ) so this important scenes have underwhelmed & lose a star however i want to finish on a positive note  as this is still a good introduction to shang chi & if this character is able to be integrated correctly into the marvel universe with the likes of ( new thor )  ( new captain america )  captain marvel  incredible hulk & dr strange etc etc then we really could have something special again to watch & enjoy as the potential is there!,Positive
345,"i went into this movie with my friends a couple of weeks ago  and my first impression was actually really good and a lot better than i thought nice fight sequences  nice looking sets and costumes  especially in ""ta lo"" and the plot was fine too  despite the huge amount of cgi at the end that was a bit too much for me  ""shang chi"" ist something different and refreshing in the mcu and in all this comic/superhero movies one of the better mcu movies for sure ",Positive
346,"i'm pretty well aware that i'm late to the party because i wasn't interested at first  but the more i think about its high ratings and scores  the stronger my urge to think like ""well  there's no harm watching it once  is there?""  well  to honest  it's pretty decent  mcu with a touch of jackie chan's ""police story"" series with some elements of wire fu that you can find in 2000's ""crouching tiger hidden dragon"" and 2002's ""hero""  because  you know  all of those ancient china settings  it's pretty intense at first  gets a little boring in the middle  then becomes action packed again by the third act  though it's going a little bit too rushed  the cgi is pretty standard  mcu standard  which means good  not great  not terrible  love simu  he really looks like he's having fun with the role he's given; awkwafina's character isn't as annoying as i had thought it would be; and as usual  like i've been saying about the mcu: some of the jokes are cringey or don't land very good at best  but it's just me tho  i don't know about you guys  maybe you'll find it funny you'd laugh your ass off  or just smile a little  who knows? find it yourself   8 5/10 ",Positive
347,for a character who is not main in the comics  that was awesome i'm really excited about what's coming more than i was right now  i can't wait to see what is going to happen and how the mcu is going to be ,Positive
348,this movie has a very good start  we were properly introduced to the characters and the tone was pretty light hearted and funny  the fights had good choreography for the most part  some of them did go on a bit too long but it wasn't that bad  the characters are very distinct and are well written  the humor was actually funny for the most part but it felt out of place at times  the plot wasn't too bad  it made sense and didn't have any noticeable plot holes  the only problem i have with this movie is how weak the buildup was to the big fight  it really took a lot of excitement away from it  nevertheless  the fight was still very good  i do recommend that you watch this movie it is very fun  emotional and something to remember ,Positive
349,i loved the cast  music  plot  everything  i especially loved xialing because she was so powerful  morris was also so so adorable  i really enjoyed all the action  as well as some comedic scenes and i'm so ready for the next shang chi movie!,Positive
350,the marvel machine continues to turn out grand entertainments with remarkable regularity  shang chi is no exception  this film mixes light drama  comedy  and action in an entertaining brew  the visual effects and art direction impress  though the action scenes are exciting  the presence of michelle yeoh occasionally reminds of films where thrilling stunts and martial arts were performed without the aid of visual effects ,Positive
351,i finally got the chance to watch it and i was right to be happy and excited about it  perfect visuals  emotional performances and best action scenes!,Positive
352,i like  and watch quite a few  'asian' martial arts movies  this isn't one   sort of   but the martial arts in it is really good  some shock to say awkwafina has a great role and she plays it so well  even if you only slightly like the mcu  you have to see this movie  and stay through all of he credits ,Positive
353,i was hooked within the first 10 minutes of the move  and then it turned american hollywood way too fast and became a 1 star movie  i could not even finish the last 20 minutes of the movie it was so bad  they introduced horrible actors with horrible dialog that just made the movie dumb and worthless i gave this movie 2 stars only because of the first 10 minutes were ok i'd really like to get at the root of the problem of the recent bad movie epidemic coming out of hollywood that's been going on for about the last 5 years  what gives!?,Negative
354,i was so excited to see this just becos of tony leung  and he pulled this off amazingly  he probably the few or actually the only one villian that you love in the mcu  all the casts are good  the sister is a bit soft but ok  anyways  it's a fun movie  and if you like tony leung  you have to see this  this film will make you love tony even more ,Positive
355,i actually didn't believe anything could top endgame but the mcu has recently surprised me with the latest spiderman  and shang chi is really perfect  the cast is fantastic and the story is great  i'm glad to congratulate the whole team on such a nice project  thumbs up !,Positive
356,also not a bad marvel film given it's weakness of obscure characters  shang chi didn't pop up much in the 616 during the last 15 years of comic events  more of a marvel knights series character in recent times  what real saves the film is awkwafina's performance of the quirky sidekick  she's actually funny rather than annoying ,Positive
357,i've been a marvel fan for a long time now and i must say this is black panther level impressive  a great origin story  great characters and visual effects and of course the action  any marvel's fan will absolutely love it and if you're new to the scene this is a great start ,Positive
358,shang chi (simu liu) moved away from his father wenwu and the ten rings organization (tony leung) 10 years ago to live a normal life  but when his father comes looking for him  he is forced to confront his past alongside his best friend katy (awkwafina) and sister xialing (meng'er zhang) i have to admit  i knew nothing about this character when this film was first announced  i was sceptical whether i would like it or not  it did not disappoint; this movie was really good  i have seen every marvel movie released  and this one felt so unique the story was one i thoroughly enjoyed and was invested in  and this movie has some of the best choreographed fight scenes in recent history that complemented the storytelling very well  it was so good to look at  the two most insane instances were the bus scene which was incredibly done and my personal favourite of the movie  but also the scaffolding scene a close second  that's not to say there wasn't excessive use of cgi in certain aspects of this movie  especially towards the end of the film  but that was expected as it's what you can expect from marvel nowadays simu liu is amazing in this movie  he nails all the fight scenes  but even some of the down to earth heartfelt scenes he was great  awkwafina is also really good in this movie  i wasn't sure about her at first  from her opening scene  i felt like she was going to be an annoying character throughout  but she wasn't  she was hilarious and she has great chemistry with simu  i loved tony leung's performance as the leader  he is up there for me as one of the best villains in any marvel movie  i wasn't sure how to feel with ben kingsley returning for this movie  but i admit i enjoyed his scenes in this the pacing was pretty good in the film  i can't think of a single moment that i felt didn't belong and i didn't enjoy watching  my only real flaw to this movie is the ending  the creatures near the end were pretty underwhelming in my opinion  they were hyped up to be menacing creatures  but just felt like overdone cgi to create some intense moments  not to say it was not fun  just thought it could have been better used this was an entertaining movie  and i would recommend it  7/10 ,Positive
359,marvel is losing it and it is becoming embarrassing and ugly  black widow was pretty bad  this is downright awful  the script was beyond idiotic (want your kids to come home? send assassins to kill them)  the pacing was all over the place and katy has to be the worst combination of annoying character and annoying actress since rose tico  seriously  cut your losses and run ,Negative
360,"shang chi (why the hyphen and how is it supposed to be pronounced?)  the son of the most powerful man on earth (who no one had ever heard about ) makes ends meet in usa as a valet driver named ""shaun ""after a gratuitous and unnecessary ""ferris bueller's day off"" (1986) stunt with his girl friend (with a space in between  or  perhaps  a hyphen)  we discover shaun's secret identity  as some assassins try to kill him in a bus ride to steal a pendant he's been wearing since his mother gave it to him when he was a child next  shang chi goes to his sister's hideout  who has a similar pendant  using the address on a postcard he received  he hadn't heard of her since he ran away from his father's house  many years ago at the hideout  shang chi engages in a fight  just for exposition  against his sister  who defeats him in a matter of seconds  after that  cliché surprise  he finds out that she didn't send him the mcguffin postcard   ! a moment later  the villains come crashing in  and eventually capture everybody  except for shang chi  who is defeated by his father in a single strike  after he arrived at the hideout a few minutes later  time enough for a lot more expository fighting with the family forcibly reunited  back at shang chi's father's house  we discover that he has been hearing his deceased wife calling from ""beyond "" that ""beyond"" being in the secret village she came from  which can only be reached through magical means eventually  shang chi and friends manage to escape and head to the secret village  with the help of ben kingsley and a plushy merchandise  there  they train for one day  which was enough for them to master archery  wire fu  dragon riding and kamesen'nin sama's iconic kamehameha (tm) to defeat the father and the evil creature ""beyond"" a sealed gate  which has been luring the father into breaking the seal happy ending comes with a high price tag  except for aunt michelle yeoh  all other support characters die  including shang chi's father  after a cliché redemption  using the inherited ten rings  shang chi kills the evil creature  very easily  actually an awful lot of things in this film are incoherent  unnecessary or just plain dumb 1) the bus fight: why were shang chi's henchmen trying to kill him  if his father wanted him alive (unless he didn't  but  in that case  they could have killed him in his apartment  while sleeping  not in a stupid bus)?2) why shang chi's father sent him a postcard with his sister's address? he already knew where both of them were  so why kidnap them together  when picking them one at a time would've been much cheaper  faster and easier?3) why does shang chi's father send minions to do things he is obviously able to do with a single strike of the ten rings? actually  he usually shows up a little later just to do exactly that 4) why cars  or helicopters? the controller of the ten rings can fly  duh!5) shang chi's girl friend masters archery in a single day  hitting moving target at impossible distances better than warriors that have been training for thousand of years 6) shang chi's father couldn't defeat the great evil creature  even after thousands of years of wearing ad mastering the ten rings  but shang chi  without any previous training with them  is able to kill the creature in a single battle (using a single move  actually  digging a whole in its chest with the rings )7) why did they seal the destroyer of worlds creature  if all they needed to do was use the ten rings to kill it? shang chi's father didn't create them  he just acquired them from some undisclosed place and learned how to use them  the first encounter with his soon to be wife showed that she not only knew the artefacts  but knew how to control them  so why not simply use them and end the menace?8) why shang chi and not his sister? seriously  she's way better than him in the art of a kicking  having been training non stop for years  while he slacked in karaoke bars  she's the one most likely to have mastered the ten rings and the kamehameha (tm) (in a single day or otherwise ) she also should've been the one to kill the evil creature 9) what was the deal with ben kingsley? i mean  i liked seeing him in the film (as in any film  really ) but i couldn't understand what he was doing there  wasn't shang chi's girl*friend the comic relief? the only thing he does is interface the communication between humans and the plushy merchandise  any other mcguffin would have done there  or just remove it altogether  as the labyrinth itself is meaningless  as it doesn't lead to the village  but to a teleportation gate made of water (don't ask  just accept   )10) shang chi doing the kamehameha (tm) without saying ""kame    hame    ha!"" was very underwhelming    he could have said ""turtle's destroyer wave strike"" in chinese  if using japanese in a chinese centric film was a problem   yeah  that last one was not really a thing  but it would've been a lot funnier  shang chi's girl*friend actually mentions him doing the kamehameha  for effect  so why not simply play along  or is only deadpool allowed to break the fourth wall indiscriminately?summarising  there was an evil creature that could have been killed using a special weapon  the ten rings  but  instead  was sealed behind a gate  just to release itself thousands of years later and  then  finally be properly killed by the mentioned weapon the film is a series of excuses to tie several action packed scenes together  without a coherent story to back them up  the titular ten rings are never explained  they are a mcguffin themselves  simply appearing on the first scene to introduce shang chi's father and put the film into motion the action scenes themselves are tainted with too much unnecessary wire fu  making them cartoonish and disappointing it's a big waste of ben kingsley's dramatic/comedic energy and michelle yeoh's martial talents to put it in a relatable perspective  ""shang chi"" was like the second half of ""iron man"" (2008)  when all that we really wanted was that it was like the first half of it ",Negative
361,"shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is a 2021 american superhero film based on marvel comics  the film was directed by destin daniel crettonit's good 🙂
i'd recommend it if you like this genre 👍🏼you can't outrun your destiny ",Positive
362,this is the worst marvel movie i have seen to date after seeing the movie i was honestly surprised by all the high ratings  did we watch the same thing? the movie is without a soul  characters aren't build up enough even with a 2 hour run time  the movie literally got nothing to do with the ten rings  movie became godzilla vs king kong at the end  waste of 2 hours  honestly clueless why people high praised for this movie  what a waste of opportunity to create a wonderful and authentic world for asian marvel universe ,Positive
363,oh my gosh! where do i even start? first  high expectations for this movie but it sadly  did not live up to those expectations   there is a lot to talk about  i don't want to be too harsh on this movie because it was made during the coronavirus time  the quality of movies have decreased ever since the movie begins by introducing us to the father of shang chi; also know as the man who never becomes old thanks to the powerful ten rings  we get a story of how he meets his airbending wife and shang chi gets born to see his now powerless mother get 1v20 by a bunch of dudes then dies  this new hero's story is pretty similar to robin from the teen titans  he trains so hard and becomes an absolute assassin or master martial artist  right? let's disregard everything else about this movie and talk about who would win in a 1v1  nightwing vs shang chi  place your bets guys  i'm voting for nightwing this movie has awesome fight scenes but i also have a problem with those scenes  they look too easy! don't get me wrong  i cannot do those sick flips and spins  what i mean is  the enemies are too weak  i expected deadlier and more skilled ninjas  i also feel bad for that buff dude! c'mon! they made him seem so weak! that's the freaking guy from creed 2  i even thought it was scott adkins at first  another concern for this movie is this cgi  it looked great at first  but started falling off during the ending which relied on heavy visual effects  story felt bland and had so much back stories and it was confusing  last bad thing is the romance  shang chi and this girl from ocean's eight have 0 chemistry! they were perfect as friends! ugh! i'm sorry but this did not feel like a marvel movie  disappointed but i shouldn't blame them  it's the fault of coronavirus  that's why it still gets a 6 ,Negative
364,everybody around me raved about this movie  but i watched it very late and now i'm slightly disappointed  it didn't live up to all the hype and all the praise but seemed very much like any other marvel movie  but what i am truly impressed with  was the blend of martial arts in the mcu  it fit so perfectly  this wasn't just another movie with a sprinkle of asian characters for representation  no this actually tells their story  speaks their language  and depicts the details  the fight scenes are fun  there is some light comedy  no gore  and the cgi was gooooood  the backstory and narration made the fantasy seem real it pulled at my heartstrings when it connected to iron man  i did not see that coming though it certainly made up for my disappointment with awkwafina (katy)  the movie had a lot of slow parts and parts where i was losing interest and seemed somewhat like a good vs evil movie? come to think of it  it felt like a disney movie trying to teach me about asian cultures and the inherent good in the universe i'll agree it was dramatic and stays with you as 20 minutes post the movie  i was trying to channel the universe with open palms and gentle hand motions  not something i do every day ,Positive
365,maybe it's just me but i didn't like it as much i forgot ben kingsley's character after so many years and how is it tie up to this?why is awkwafina in this and how the heck is she a superhero? i mean this is stupid the action was badass and the entire family  father  mother  son and daughter are perfectly casted and we're great the rest i didn't care for and the dragon storyline wasn't necessary is that all there is from hollywood is superheroes movies?,Positive
366,shang chi is hands down the best asian representation film  it took a while for marvel to make a martial arts film  and they certainly couldn't have done better by roping in destin daniel cretton for his character driven directing repertoire and tony leung   the master of asian cinema   for his first english language role  the fight choreography is the highlight of the movie  while the newish cast   simu liu  awkwafina and me'gher chang deliver memorable performances playing their action hero roles with a touch of humour  the film's climax   with dragons and monsters   feels somewhat cheesy after its brilliant first half  but hey it wouldn't be a marvel movie without cgi monsters  overall  shang chi is a fun movie for multiple repeated viewings ,Positive
367,nothing new just cgi fight scenes and culture that was it nothing new it was terrible marvel should've stopped at endgame now they are just producing garbage movies ,neutral
368,i saw this movie from start to finish and am glad the movie ended  it actually wasn't very interesting or entertaining  the acting wasn't great  it felt very predictable  please no sequel!,Positive
369,at first i thought this was gonna be a okay ish movie but it's not it's actually a good movie and the story is good the action is great and awkwafina is the best    it's fun to actually see a new and more powerful hero in the universe and who is funny like seriously he's funny and the action choreography is great because those punches damn those were some real punches and kicks    this movie is great and it's marvel so no doubt there go watch it!   ,Positive
370,this trip to a secluded wonder of a village and a community of magical abilities was absolutely breathtaking with it's mesmerising visuals  music is gorgeous and are effective at delivering the tone of the tale  folk tales and fist fights  love and loss  family and unity it's a complete movie with a great cast who brought the best out of the story ,Positive
371,one of the better marvel movies  the fathers acting was not good  action was top tier  it was consumed by action  some would say over consumed ,Positive
372,besides the opening  which was magnificently well done  the first 10 mins are pretty rough with the cheesy  disney level humor but once the action scenes come along  man this movie never stops getting better! this movie didn't feel like a typical marvel film  and that's why i liked it so much  the character work is very well done  you enjoy the energy everyone brings to the scene and the movie stands firmly on it's own  the last marvel film i saw was blackwidow and that was a stinker for me shang chi was a more than capable step up  i can't speak too much about the film without spoilers for those that didn't see it  but it's a great film go ahead and check it out!,Positive
373,    but the previews ruined every single plot point when will they learn??,Negative
374,i thought this movie would suck honestly when i heard it was being made  i thought shang chi is a terrible character with no powers and then i always dread hollywood making asian movies lol im chinese by the way and when i finally watched it i was blown away!!! this was best movie of the year  maybe one of the best marvel movies that didnt involve a blockbuster teamup like avengers infinity wars and end game so action packed  excellent script  insane graphic visuals  insane fighting choreography  alot of character depth and explorations  well made indeed! this is the black panther movie for all asians! i say all asians because chinese culture has affected all asian countries in the last 3000 years dont let the reviews bother you  alot of these people dont know what their talking about honestly  seen 1 person mention theirs no villain but this movie takes villain into an indepth look  for every villain theirs a drive & purpose to why they do things and for this villain it involved love  some may not be able to comprehend this as they view villains stone cold killers maybe or just destructive no emotion type of baddies they wrote the script for this villain amazingly considering he was originally the mandarin (a very stereotypical villain hated by asians)  the clever way they were able to remove that racist heritage to this character was flawless  funny and amazing i mean cmon it was hilarious the way the villain described how his name came some even complained they got lost during the whole movie which i found it hard to believe  i mean you must have low iq lmao go not understand n follow through the movie  from beginning to end it was a step through step process  maybe they could have explored more about the magical lands but whois to say they wont in future movies?? all u needed to know was in the movie  and any other questions can be saved for the future just as most marvel movies always do the fight scenes on the bus were off the charts and so was the rest of it  i can see theirs many chinese people hating on this film cuz they feel the fighting style is too like chinese movies fighting style but they dont get it  what made this movie very good was the amazing way they blended chinese and western movies together  the fight scenes was neither just chinese nor was it western  it was a perfect blend this stories villajn was writting the way thanos was but better  thanos was not just crazy mad villain  he had purpose and feelings and goals that involved not just world domination or killing  same with this villain  tony leung may have had not many lines in this movie but the way he carried his presence and the acting was outstanding i have watched tony leung in hong kong movies for 30 years now and his acting is impeccable  he brought life to the villain he played  and gave it a more down to earth and also relatable character portrayal  anyone in his position in the movie would have had a chance to go his path  i know many might disagree but it was so easy to see how he deviated from the good path he took for some time back to evil  you just need to understand the character and his reasons and experiences the main character sima liu i mean was pretty good choice  their were some scenes for fighting that looked to be him doing the stunts and it was amazing i seen some complain that the movie should have been just mandarin but thats clearly a comment made by someone from china or mandarin speaking  to them they live in the old age where black is black  white is white  theirs no grey only way asians can move forward in hollywood is by a blend of both west n east maybe some people might hate it cause its so much asian characters n that its got mandarin language in it  then u got others who hate it cuz theirs english in it  both groups need to grow up and live in the year 2021 cuz this movie was so successful because of the mixture of both cultures in 1 if this movie was just another straight chinese martial arts flick it would certainly not be successful in the west  this blend is what makes it open up to other races to watch and enjoy the special effects of the movie was off the charts! amazing!! the fighting too!this movie is the black panther for asians  its the opening door for asians to be introduced more commonly if anyone in or from china reads this i think u should think hard to yourself  do you want to see more chinese movies succeed in the future?? cuz if so then u should ccheer this movie on cause its gonna open doors for chinese actors n actresses china blocking this movie from playing makes no sense as the way for china to spread love is share their culture with all especially after the pandemic fiasco  this movie opens the doors of chinese culture up to westerners so support this movie! and stop bashing it for unfounded selfish reasons ,Positive
375,"if it was darker and more serious  it would have been fire!i didnt like them comedy parts  took big part of the movie  and even though i laughed  i would prefer the movie to be darker and more serious   
it left me a disney vibe  kinda mulan?choreography was a game    amazing   
also the last credit scene was gr8   
overall   6/ 10 ",Positive
376,best backgrounds of story of marvel action and king fu hustle  problems is other universe karate kids 2010 need be more king fu title than cobra kai  need more kung fu furry which need nekojishi like shu chi the leopard cats inspire shang chi  need more felines super hero ,Positive
377,great story line and even better casting  loved the balance and character development  action sequences were amazing and really recommend this movie set up was good for a sequel ,Positive
378,and the fight on the bus so badly done that i turned it off  i now have to write a bunch of drivel to get this review published  still more required  i apologize if you have to read this ,Negative
379,"i could tell from the trailer exactly what this was  i e  a boring 2010 era superhero movie  and of the worst kind where the primary ""power"" means lots of fighting with fists and legs (almost as boring as everything based on daredevil  just a bit better because of a hint of actual superpowers or super objects) but there was one welcome surprise: the bagua zhang fights and everyone involved in them  especially the first 1 on 1 fight in the forest  which went unmatched in beauty for the whole rest of the movie  that's a scene i will be re watching several times  guaranteed  the rest of the movie though    didn't really need to exist  just like the vast majority of 2010 era superhero movies ",Positive
380,hands down one of my favorite additions to the mcu  the story is fun  unique  and refreshing  the cast is great   everyone has amazing chemistry  and the story is action packed and heartfelt ,Positive
381,if you don't know tony leung's influence in the chinese movie industry  i recommend watching grandmaster by wong kar wai (probably one of the best chinese movie in this century)  the story itself really didn't impress me  because every marvel movie sort of has a pattern by now  and the script writers are basically replacing different characters into corresponding spots  however  i do get marvel's intention of enlarging their superhero community to outside of the western world through the huge amount of mandarin conversation  also  as a typical chinese  the movie's theme of parent's expectation colliding with the new generation's rebellion  really resonates with me  specifically  tony leung's depiction of an adherent  reserved  and occasionally ruthless father is one biggest reason i gave this film a 7  talk about character  i truly don't appreciate the performance of our protagonist: i think the long and dull middle section describing shang's mother's death is simply trying to waste time and cover up the fact that this character has no soul  aside from that  the actions scenes are pretty well done  especially the starting due between wenwu and shang's mother  go watch grandmaster  it has better fight scenes of true martial artists ,Positive
382,my riveiw that i write on septmber 2 was deleted so i will write a new riveiw best marvel film ever! show us something that we never got to seen (in a good way) and i like it and i cant wait to meet shang chi agian and see shang chi 2!,Positive
383,"shang chi and the legend of the ten rings introduces a new marvel character/avenger  and that's shang chi  the way that the film introduced that character was great  loved how the film jumps back and forth a few times to tell us about shang chi's past when he was young and how or why he ended up where he is in the present day the film had so many fight scenes that were amazing and the cinematography that was used to shoot these fight scenes made them 10x better and that's perhaps because the cinematographer of this film is bill pope who shot the matrix (1999) and sam raimi's spider man 2 (2004)  you could tell for sure that there are a lot of similarities between the fight scenes in shang chi and the matrix especially that both of them had this ""kung fu"" style of fighting  loved how sometimes during the fight scenes the ""dutch tilt"" method was used and it was wide showing the stunning set design around the film is also visually stunning which i'm happy to call one of marvel's most visually stunning films  it's a treat for the eyes the comedy in the film was so good and used very carefully in perfect times which is something that scares me whenever i watch a ""marvel"" film  because these films are supposed to be ""serious superhero"" films  but  when comedy is used in perfect times  the result will be perfect akwafina's acting was very great  loved her character and am excited to see what her character will have in future mcu films  simu liu was of course the perfect actor for this role but one thing that in my opinion he ""failed at"" are the ""emotional scenes""  this film has so many emotional scenes that discuss ""family"" and the relationship between a father and his son  i felt like simu liu couldn't be able to deliver that emotional feeling to the audience because his acting was bad in these emotional scenes  this brings me to tony chiu wai leung who plays ""the father""  leung carried the whole film in my opinion  whenever there was an emotional scene between the father and his son  leung was way better at expressing and showing his feelings than simu liu loved all the visual effects  they were all well made especially that the film has so many  the customs as well are great and loved how sometimes the colors represent shang chi's culture like the ""football varsity jacket"" that was red and grey that shang chi was wearing at the beginning of the film i got to point out that the last 30 minutes or so of the film are one of the greatest and most enjoyable in the whole mcu my rating is 8/10 ",Positive
384,good story line  brilliant action  great acting  loved it all would have loved to see this on a big screen  but covid has done damage to all  nevertheless i completely got wrapped up in it not going to offer any spoilers but wished i could have seen some of the earlier history of the family good one to add to my marvel collection ,Positive

386,this movie has a lot of balance and solid chemistry  i thought there would be the excess kung foolish and overacting but only a little  excellent comedic time  decent storyline  several connections to other stories  and a sprinkle of disney  they did copy a bit from nobody  speed and the jaws character from james bond but it was ok you won't be disappointed ,Positive
387,"what's all the fuss and negative reviews  this was a fun funny movie for the holidays  a stand alone marvel show ""a la"" ant man  guardians of the galaxy and thor rocnarok anyone can understand and enjoy without being a comic geek or have any knowledge of the marvel universe  it was a lot more enjoyable than the marvel tv series of fist of fury (lost white rich guy protagonist inheriting kung fu powers)  great fx  funny interaction with actors  loved the ""friend"" chemistry between the protagonists  and fantastic martial/ballet like dance scenes  perfect for the holidays ",Positive
388,"this movie is both fine  yet very flawed  the first issue is pacing  it's quite exhausting  action break flashback action flashback action break break break flashback action  it's as if you tried to first sprint  then suddenly halt and tip toe walk and then run a marathon only to sprint again second issue are flashbacks  this movie is riddled with them  and i don't mind them   unless they keep on returning to exactly the same scene over and over and over again with that difference that you get to listen to new part of the talk  i don't remember any other movie that was so riddled with flashbacks third issue are fights  now this has to be broken in 2 groups; ""magical fights"" and ""down to earth fights""  the first was done terribly  camera shake  way too close  badly lighted and confusing as heck  there was some vision  some idea  yes  but it turned into ""cgi slosh""  this could have been done oh so much better   but we got pointless confusing close ups then camera shaky shaky moments instead  the second group reminds me of jackie chan movies  you know   kung fu stuff  which was great    to some extend fourth issue is main character  he's the extend from point earlier  he's like blank slate punching bag in this show  he has no real emotions and just goes with the flow  he >never< speaks his mind and rather just silently mumbles his agreement for whatever plan others come up with  it was annoying  really grating  ok  i don't mind if mc is not an iron man of a character  but i had seen corpses put more action while being decomposing than shang chi  also he gets beaten pretty much all the time  there are only 3'ish exceptions where he shows real emotions  and again   shoddy pacing cripples them slightly the second character  his friend   katey (i think)   she was fine  she was active and i couldn't shake this feeling that she's the brains of the team with witty humor  while he's broody muscle man with past there were few amazing scenes  which i loved alot  really  but beyond that it was just mediocre  thank god it was ""just"" mediocre  considering what things marvel relases lately  mediocre is fine  really  tiresome  extended to the point of exhausting    but fine! a (not so) solid 7!oh also  there are quite a few plot holes and whatnot ranging from minor (assassins using stun weapons only   lol) to extreme (spoilery stuff)   but at this point   i just can't even bother  just roll my eyes and force my brain to stop thinking about it  to become a script writer in 202x all you need to know is how to sniff glue with class and how to agree to everything corporate monkeys in expensive suits tell you should you watch it? if marvel fan   you already seen it  if you aren't marvel fan  but still enjoy sci fi/fantasy    eh    not like there's anything better to do i guess ",Positive
389,boring and poor storyline why there have to be a dragon if it's a asian origin movie  this is such a stereotype  this is marvel's sad attempt to cover all the asian market  avoid this ,Negative
390,10/10an excellent story superbly told  flourished with colour  visual spirit & awesome fight sequences a diverse cast who each shine in their roles amongst a load of action  moments of humour  bits of drama & a tad of romance some of the best action scenes i have seen since captain america & the winter soldier  albeit a lot of difference between the two fighting styles they still stand out individually go & see this movie in gold class in a recliner with a snack or two  highly recommended  even for those that do not follow the marvel franchise  it is worth watching for the story  action & humour ,Positive
391,ten rings or is it ten bracelets? i will leave the research for you and the marvel fans debate  and how accurate this movie is to the orignal comics  focusing on this movie i must say it was flat right through until we get to the magical lands  cultural mythical accuracy is sadly pushed aside by the writers and animators to retain a very standard plot  characters' poor dialogues didnt help but the odd joke rarely did succeed  and i was very disappointed that there was a very poor attempt to capture the classical and contemporary kung fu element in the fights   it was limited and opportunity largely missed  if this movie was not apart of the next grandeur marvel phase  i would have not be surprised to see another attempt/ reboot in five or ten years ,Negative
392,this movie is what they were trying to do with black panther   but shang shi succseededalso happy to see marvel learned how to make fight scenes  finallya few stupid jokes as per normal  they kind of ruin the moment sometimes  but the movie still gets a pass  watchable!!!,Positive
393,not gonna lie i had fewer expectations; but since it's marvel studios  things turned out to be a lot better than i expected  action sequences with martial arts are enjoyable and jaw dropping  the cinematography  camera work  editing  and bgm are impressive so are the performances  though not much of an exceptional storyline but will keep you invested throughout  highly recommended and a great reason to get back to the theatre again! ❤,Positive
394,shang chi is one of marvel comic's most unknown and underutilized characters in their comics  with his original comics containing a decent amount of racist imagery and embarrassing caricatures of various asian stereotypes  at it's best  the mcu can turn any obscure group or concept from the comics into gold  and shang chi is no different shang chi might be one of the best examples of an idea that's actually better on film than the original source material  with the character's relationships  motivations  and place in the overall marvel universe all being improved upon in the film adaptation as opposed to the comics where he's mainly a hand to hand expert with no powers or special weapons  and isn't generally of much value to the avengers simu liu is charismatic and athletically gifted enough to do solid justice to the lead role  i hope the sequel gives him even more to do with his character and his legacy  but for an introduction  this was great  awkwafina  michelle yeoh  and of course the legendary tony leung all lend their talents to a great cast of characters wen wu is easily one of the top villain/antagonist characters in the mcu and probably all of comic book films  he's intimidating and masterful as a ruler  but heartfelt and believable as a family man  his presence elevates the entire production as he's a legend of cinema there's moments reminiscent of black panther  and the third act gets heavy into chinese mythological imagery  but understand that this is not only meant as a superhero movie  but also a love letter to chinese storytelling and culture shang chi features some of the best physical/non super powered fight scenes in the mcu  with the choreography and the cinematography of said action taking a higher level  as soon as i saw the bus fight scene in the opening i had no worries about this part of the movie the ten rings themselves are not a weapon used in the comics  and are a wonderfully creative  versatile  and visually stunning weapon unlike anything i've ever seen before  and that's not an easy thing to say having seen as much comic book and sci fi material as me some of the pacing and character development could be a little better  but overall shang chi is on the higher end of marvel movies  and can also be solidly enjoyed by audiences totally unfamiliar with marvel in general ,Positive
395,"i'll make this very brief:if it wasn't for the stupid  tacked on marvel silliness  the lazy writing and this ""actress"" ""awkwafina""  this would have been a potentially nice film the action is a bit slow for hong kong style  but great in choreography and composition  the cgi extensive and sometimes obvious and tiresome the plot isn't great  but has some nice aspects to it   too bad that the film wasn't bold enough to follow through  and too bad that ""awkwafina"" ruined every scene she was in the score was decent  if a bit generic  but better than average for 2021 and marvel in general all in all  this was enjoyable nonsense with lots of cringe  but also lots of great stuff  if they would have focussed more on the characters and less on the fat around them  it would have been much better please  disney  get better writers ",Positive
396,in 2018  the marvel cinematic universe opened its doors to telling stories centered on people of color  providing the audiences with the rich  lush history of wakanda and the wakandan peoples  i wouldn't go so far as to call it a cultural revolution  but the impact black panther had on the moviegoing audience is undeniable  since then  the mcu has released two female centered films in captain marvel and black widow and now we've arrived at shang chi and the legend of the ten rings  the first superhero movie to focus on characters of chinese heritage  with this unveiling of a new corner of the connected universe comes new threats  new wonders  and new heroes to root for  shang chi  originally appearing in marvel comics' master of kung fu in the 1970s  now has an updated origin story for the modern times and a cast to reflect contemporary sensibilities opening with a fight scene that has an almost dream like  ethereal storybook quality  the movie is packed with tons of action  heart  and humor  the father and son theme that is always so prevalent in the mcu is once again on full display here  this time coupled with a theme of legacies and living up to one's potential  both shang chi and his friend katy are at peace with their low key lives as valets while both have parental figures who want more from them  in shang chi's case  his father wenwu wants him to eventually take his side as master of the ten rings  a multinational crime syndicate (a rainbow coalition of crime)  that  paired with wenwu's notion that this departed wife  shang chi's mother  is still alive and being held captive in a mystical city  are the heart of the film  complete with great worldbuilding  awesome fight scenes  and amazing visuals with black widow and now shang chi and the legend of the ten rings  phase four of the mcu continues with the relative low stakes that comes after the insurmountable high of avengers: endgame  in shang chi  a single village is at peril as wenwu will stop at nothing to save his wife  accompanying wenwu are the ten rings  ten mystical arm bands that imbue the wearer with superhuman abilities  if you're one for explanations  you won't find any here as the rings are never fully explored beyond looking cool and being used to kick ass  one of the positives of the film is the fact that questions are left to be answered in the inevtiable sequel  speaking of sequels  both end credits set up to help fully integrate the characters into the wider scope of the mcu while also serving as a platform for a continuation of shang chi and sister xialing's personal stories while thoroughly entertaining  the film isn't without faults  as is the seemingly the norm for superhero movies  shang chi and the legend of the ten rings' third act devolves into a cgi fest that at times is hard to follow visually  without risking spoilers  the final battle  a mixture of natural and mystical elements  is choppy and confusing  it doesn't quite reach the levels of wonder woman bad  but there was potential for a more emotionally satisfying climax that was somewhat glossed over in favor of what we got  also  from a comics perspective  the choice to include a location that draws heavy parallels to kun lun (mystical city; multiple characters dressed in green and yellow  traditional iron fist colors; talk of the heart of a dragon) yet not outright include iron fist lore is a baffling one starring simu liu  shang chi and the legends of the ten rings put the chinese actor first and foremost  giving liu the opportunity to display his talents  as a member of the ensemble cast of sitcom kim's convenience  liu shares the screen with a number of actors and actresses  but here as the leading man he's given the spotlight to shine  liu's easygoing charm and affable nature will quickly win over audiences and endear them to the character  liu's dramatic chops are on display as well as shang chi spends the film clashing with both his sister and his father's way of life  liu's shang chi is here to stay in the mcu and after seeing his performance in his first outing  marvel studios has proven yet again one of their biggest talents lies in their ability to cast the right person for the right role  as such  hong kong born actor tony leung's first major introduction to western audiences as wenwu finally gives americans a chance to see one of the best living actors on display  liu's style of quiet  pensive  deliberately nuanced acting isn't a major focus in shang chi; the character of wenwu is just a few steps above a phase one villain  similarly  ray winstone's dreykov in black widow (while severely less developed than wenwu)  also has the feel of a phase one villain which feeds into the idea of the mcu wiping the slate clean and resetting expectations back to their beginnings  still  leung is a joy to watch whenever he's on screen and his chemistry when paired with liu makes for strong material awkwafina as katy continues her trend of seemingly being awkwafina in every role she's cast in  from ocean's eight to crazy rich asians to shang chi  her ebullient line delivery and acting style is at this point either well worn or a comfortable blanket  depending on the penchant of the viewer  katy's chemistry with shang chi is undeniable  however  as the pair make for possibly the best on screen cinematic coupling since steve rogers and peggy carter  the brilliance of this pairing lies not in a good romantic subplot  but two incredibly close friends  ready to help each other out in any circumstance  if jimmy woo and darcy are our mulder and scully of the mcu  shang chi and katy are harry and heromoine  ready for wacky adventures at a moment's notice while being comfortable with the nature of their relationship  one of the standouts of the film is meng'er zhang as xialing  shang chi's estranged sister  zhang manages to command the screen with something akin to pent up rage and frustration as xialing is determined to make her own legacy in the world  zhang's growth and progression as a friend or foe foil for shang chi is a delight to watch thanks to strong writing for the character and strong acting from zhang directed by destin daniel cretton  shang chi is a busy movie  audiences are introduced to not just a new hero in the mcu  but an entirely new world  something not seen since 2018  intercutting between events of past and present  this is the first of the marvel films to rely heavily on flashbacks to establish relationships between characters  the non linear storytelling works thanks largely in part to certain reveals that awards previously withheld information from the audience  unfortunately  while trying to keep the storytelling fresh by bouncing from past to present  the second act still feels sluggish due to heavy expositions from wenwu and jian nan  both carry a hefty bit of dialogue as they explain to shang chi (and us) what's happened before in order to lay seeds of what's to come in the third act  the third act and the pathway to the inevitable confrontation between shang chi and wenwu still manages to surprise and subvert the common martial arts expectations in a way that feel somewhat satisfying  if not a bit surprising  cinematographer bill pope (the matrix trilogy  scott pilgrim vs the world) continues to dazzle with brilliant shots that  combined with great production design  manage to capture and celebrate the chinese culture in a way that doesn't feel cliché or lazy  cretton and pope manage to pay homage to a number of films via the cinematography that includes both kill bill volume 1 and skyfall of all the questions surrounding shang chi prior to its release  going all the way back to its 2019 san diego comicon announcement  the biggest area of concern was centered on the authenticity of the fight scenes  fans of previous marvel related works (looking directly at you  iron fist) have been burnt in the past when it comes to well staged fight choreography  thankfully that's not the case here  as the fight scenes are well crafted and tailored to fit the needs of each scene  multiple styles of fighting are present  from the graceful  flowing wushu style as seen employed by shang chi's mother and aunt to the more frantic  kinetic jackie chan inspired style of improvised fighting shang chi uses during the bus scene  each style is well suited for the situation at hand and goes a long way to establishing the fact that there as many different styles of hand to hand combat as there are different asian cultures  at no point do the fights seem lazy or unrehearsed; if there's one thing stunt coordinator brad allan was keen to do  it was to not repeat the mistakes of previous ventures into the genre overall  shang chi is another feather in the cap of marvel studios  finally embracing a multicultural aspect to their storytelling and recognizing that superheroes come from more places than just america  they've allowed themselves to fully open to a world of possibilities where stories steeped in any heritage can originate  a great leading performance from simu liu  a solid core cast  and a strongly directed film make shang chi a worthy addition to phase four of the mcu  how it connects to the overall tapestry woven into the interconnected universe still remains to be seen  but with two stellar end credits sequences  hopes are high that our titular hero will return for more adventures with katy in tow  shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is in theaters september 3rd ,Positive
397,shang chi and the legend of the 10 rings delivers a majestic adrenaline filled experience  incorporating the perfect formula to a marvel film ( great plot  action  comical relief  and flirting with a love interest)  all of which are displayed effectively  there was never a dull moment  this is one of the better origin stories within the marvel universe while giving us a different cultural approach  be prepared to see a couple of cameos from some hard hitting marvel characters verdictl marvel fans this one is for you! if you love action that is displayed beautifully then this is the movie for you! go to the theaters to watch this one!,Positive
398,i've been asking myself  why is it that i didn't really like the avenger movie's? i realized it's because that though the movies can be split up into nearly 5 hours  each individual character starts to get less and less time as the roster of different characters builds over the years  therefore watching an origin story movie for me is much more interesting  focus is on just a few characters and they can shine as the writing aims to let them bloom  rather tham play second fiddle to more established characters with that being said  what is shang chi and the legend of the ten rings movie all about and is this movie worth seeing? the movie at its core is about shang chi (simu liu)  a young man living in san francisco working at a hotel parking cars with his friend katy (awkwafina) very normal one would think until one day while heading home one the bus with his friend katy  shang chi is attacked by a man with a sword for an arm and several other fighters    after the fight there is exposition given to katy of what happened and that shang needs to go to macau in china to rescue his sister xialing  from there the story begins to open up  the movie itself has amazing and seamless cgi  that bring alternate dimensions to life  the colouring is so beautiful and the design of all the creatures is impeccable  the movie has many comedic moments and isn't super serious  many of these comedic moment come from the excellent ben kingsley as the almost random chatacter of trevor and also katy who is an excellent charismatic sidekick overall this is a great and i like these single character focused movies rather than avenger movies where although the stakes might be higher  personalities drown each other out and nobody gets over as much as they should ,Positive
399,"just an 80's kung fu flick jazzed up for 2021  more reminders of the 'horrible racism"" that exists  because america is the only country that's had a problem with that   herp derp ",Negative
400,this is my black panther ps  so lil nas x exists in the mcups 2   captain marvel actually looked pretty and had kind of personality in the short appearance !!,Positive
401,"without any doubt the high quality of the picture  good story concept  and surprisingly nice incidental music  however  the amount of product placement and advertisement were just tremendously toxic  so it is really disturbing and very annoying  c'mon guys you just inserted a bmw commercial for 10 minutes!? moreover  the scenario either has a strong scent of the ""fathers and sons"" (i  turgenev) or ""poor is the pupil who does not surpass the master"" (leonardo da vinci) theme  it is not bad but it is kind of predictable and creates an expected scenario that is full of clichés  additionally  the language in this movies like ""$#it"" or ""v@g1n@""  reminds me about captain america  ""language"" ;) last but not least  this movie kind of brings a lot of questions and confusion as a part of the marvel studios movies series in regards to the world pattern history where all superheroes  and particularly ""avengers"" p  s: it is much better then ""black widow"" (2021) and more interesting then ""eternals"" (2021) but it is not even close to ""guardians of the galaxy"" (2014)  or ""spider man: no way home"" (2021)  overall it is a good movie and kind of  or on the level of ""black panther"" (2018) ",Positive
402,the stories which follow warriors who have to confront a hard past  filled with pain and remorse  are intriguing to see how the main characters are getting self confident on both physically and psychologically  as the main characters through their body language they express on the way they are feeling emotionally  especially during the fight sequences  which initially their body language might be insecure to immediately lose their fight; but after the main characters have learnt in what they are looking for  their body language becomes more self confident and especially stronger  to even be ready to face their final battles to be often much intense than the first ones  the filmmaker destin daniel cretton seems interested to explore this theme  by developing a new movie for the marvel cinematic universe  this time about the character shang chi  after a long time of work  in 2021 came out shang chi and the legend of the ten rings by destin daniel cretton  with simu liu  awkwafina  meng'er zhang  tony leung  fala chen and michelle yeoh  the movie's plot: the martial artist shaun/shang chi (simu liu)  who in once has been trained to be an assassin  has left his past on the back to live in his own life in san francisco; until his father xu wenwu (tony leung)  who is in the command of the ten rings organization  has reunited him and his sister xialing (meng'er zhang) to search something essential in the village ta lo  where ying li (fala chen) the mother of shang chi and xialing guarded in once  the movie has captured a lot of attention  by surprising the audience  the critics and the fans of marvel cinematic universe movies  as the story went in a different direction than what the previous movies of the marvel cinematic universe have gone  even the movie has maintained some of the established superhero elements in the cinematic universe  especially for the way the movie explores the asian culture  by using the chinese mythological creatures  to let the audience feel emerged in another culture  through the settings and the colors to be expressive on the emotions of the story and on the feeling of the characters  the story gets much expressive in the emotions of the characters  through the choreography in the fight sequences  where their movements and their steps represent the way of how they will confront their greatest battles  both internally and externally  the production designer sue chan has elaborated the settings with specific details  to be expressive through the mythological look to the let the eyes of the audience be emerged in the story; at the same time  some of the most specific settings are filled with colors  which make them much powerful of the emotions and of the meanings on some of the most crucial moments of the story  the costume designer kum barrett has created costumes which fit with the shape and the colors of the characters  as most of them have been specifically elaborated to fit in their movements during the fight sequences; especially when the costumes fit with the body language of the characters  which can be felt without distorting their movements  the cinematographer william pope has captured in every single camera movements as well as in every single angle shots  with the help of the lightnings  the shadows and the colors  some of the most essential shots of the scenes  which make some of the most essential moments of the story unforgettably poetic and mythological  the editors elísabet ronaldsdóttis  nat sanders and harry yoon have created the narration's rhythm in a clear way on how the story will be told from the beginning to the end  without distorting the narration of the story and by using essential footage which create the movie  the visual effects have been specifically elaborated to create some of the most spectacular scenarios of the story  in every single details of pixels to let the eyes of the audience be emerged in the story; especially through the settings  colors  lightnings and shadows  which make them mythologically spectacular  the score by joel p  west has been elaborated to be more close to the asian culture  in every single musical notes to balance the emotions of the characters; as well as some of the most essential moments of the story  to blend with the scenes without distorting the narration's rhythm nor in some of the most epic moments of the movie  simu liu did an excellent performance as shaun/shang chi  a martial artist who was in once trained as an assassin  to later on get away from the dramatic past to live in his own life; until his father xu wenwu has reunited him and his sister  where shang chi has to confront his past to slowly become much confident with himself  awkwafina did an excellent performance as katy  the best friend of shang chi who has no idea about his past  until she will come with him and learns more about him; initially she shows herself to be insecure and goofy  but since she has been involved with the mission of shang chi she will become stronger internally as well as physically  meng'er zhang did an excellent performance as xialing  the sister of shang chi and the daughter of xu wenwu  who shows herself to be a strong person on the outside  but on the inside she is much vulnerable  especially because of the past which has tormented her; until she will become much confident  to be even closer to shang chi and she will be the one who will later on change something important  in a crucial moment of the story  tony leung did an extraordinary performance as xu wenwu  the leader of the ten rings organization and the father of shang chi and xialing  who tries to be a good father for how much the love he has on them both; but since something tragic has happened  he has returned of what he used to be in once  especially to search in what he is looking for  fala chen did an extraordinary performance as ying li  the wife of xu wenwu and mother of shang chi and xialing  who will be seen often times in the flashbacks for an important reason; she has been the reason to have a family with xu wenwu  as in the flashbacks ying li has taught some of the most essential lessons to shang chi  michelle yeoh did an excellent performance as ying nan  the guardian of ta lo and the aunt of shang chi and xialing  who will be the one to explain what is xu wenwu looking for and she will be also the one to teach shang chi  xialing and katy  with the help of the rest of the village  how to become much confident with themselves  shang chi and the legend of ten rings is an unexpectedly surprising movie  which uses some different elements from the previous marvel cinematic universe movies  it is one of the best movies of the cinematic universe as well as one of the best movies of 2021 ,Positive
403,have wished to watch in movie theaters    beautiful sci fi  perfect action they idea was awesome 👌 👏 👍    now the post credits scene was also good   welcome to the avengers shang  chi ,Positive
404,something i feels new to this movie like it's beautiful and it's vfx is not quite as other marvel cinematic universe films vfx's  this film actors did a great job especially the hero  he was dope in this movie  and mainly the stunts it felt quite realestic  i became to watch it lately  awesome ,Positive
405,"what do you call a man on a mission to keep his family safe? what do you call a man who just wants to fit in where he belongs? a new kind of hero  we have entered into phase 4 of the greatest movie franchise in movie history  we have seen battles  we have seen so many marvel characters in the last 12 years come to life  but this new kind of hero comes to us by surprise who here knows about shang chi? i just learned about on friday and from what i read   i can honestly tell you his story is one for the history books  i can't give out the whole movie to you or anything to spoil the movie  but this movie was different from the other movies in the mcu i was in shock from the very beginning to the end  there were a lot of ""easter eggs"" linking all the way back to tony stark  oops  i think i said a little too much  but i will say this  
this movie defied everything in the natural and supernatural realm of not only the physical  but the soul  it dives deep into the soul of a person  and that is what shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is all about i have to give a huge shout out to simu liu   like i said before   i have never heard of shang chi up until recently  but he gave the role a new meaning and a new identity now without giving too much away  with every marvel movie  there are some credit scenes that will leave you on the edge of your seat  that's all i am saying so in essence   i give shang chi and the legend of the ten rings: 11 stars ",Positive
406,starts well enough and has good dose of comedy and hard hitting action sequenceshowever it quickly tails off and is very predictablescope for the character to grow in the new mcu and hopefully the funny female sidekick will return as she was a highlight  it was also good to see actor tony slattery return and redeem himself from his stint as the mandarin in iron man 3 ,Positive
407,totally unpopular opinion here and i might be the only one  but i really didn't like it; even going into it with no expectations  i wasn't too keen on the movie in the first place  but i was swayed by everybody who watched it and said it was brilliant  what a mistake  i felt the movie was incredibly dull  generic  utterly cliched and stereotyped  crap characters  formulaic plot  and not even all that funny  as soon as the movie opened with a chinese battle banner and the twang of guzheng notes  i knew it would be bad  the action and fight scenes aren't even all that great: they relied way too much on cg  i feel like the action was nothing special: jackie chan (and yuen wah whom you'll see in shang chi) in his hey day produced way better action and fights without cg  back when the matrix first came out  that was mind blowing action that western audiences haven't seen before  if you've seen any number of hong kong martial arts movies you'll know what i mean  the third act of the movie was a total rip off of the last battle in how to train your dragon  also an absolute waste of great actors like michelle yeoh who was given nothing to do  she practically dialled in her part  positives though: tony leung  he's the one redeeming grace of this terrible and lazy movie ,Positive
408,this has to be a test  anyone that is praising this movie either has the intelligence of a 12 year old or is a complete slappie shill  the movie isn't offensively bad but it plays like it was written by a child  silly and shallow  a far cry from epic marvel ,Negative
409,marvel universe 4  not watched many of them before and know nothing about this movie before watching  except tony leung from our hong kong! plot is always similar  but the fighting on the bus is good  the last scene between the dragoon and monster is also good  and tony is just so so so smart and handsome!,Positive
410,really awesome fights  some of the best in the mcu! the fact that shang has a poster in his room  from the movie the warriors is amazing  i had a really fun time! it was funny and heartfelt  crossed the line into cheesy a time or two ,Positive
411,this movie leaves a lot to be desired the cgi is mostly well done  although not consistent throughout  with some pretty bad moments as well the action scenes are nicely done  but after the umpteenth martial arts fight scene  i have to admit  it grew a bit weary on me the story  while not truly bad in itself  is thin as paper and meanders along for too long  making the total runtime about half an hour too long in the process  it's also way too disney; that new  not so good kind it's all pretty generic in the end  seemingly providing a sort fan service (or quite frankly pandering) to the chinese audience more than anything else  by trying to cram as much chinese mythology and history in it as possible  but also just as many stereotypes and clichés  it's all very shallow and it even went into shameless territory a couple of times  which is just weird acting is decent to good  but the woman playing jar jar binks  no i mean legolas  no i mean katy  got annoying real fast with everything they had at their disposal to make a great movie  this sure could have been a whole lot better 6/10  barely ,Positive
412,i was going in expecting the film to be decent  but it's better than i thought  the film is unbelievably good and exciting!! a lot of culture and amazing martial arts  a must see film!,Positive
413,"disney and marvel have gotten to the point in their collaboration that much of their projects together seem to look and feel exactly the same  every time a new movie in the marvel cinematic universe comes out  it seems like each filmmaker has to prove that their project is more than just another superhero movie  luckily  the mcu's newest offering  shang chi and the legend of the ten rings  stands on its own as a quality action film with some of the best stunt work and visual effects of the year  the movie is not perfect  and contains some trite ""superhero"" storytelling elements that disney movies often rely on  but director/writer destin daniel cretton's clear talent behind the camera transforms every average scene into a larger than life sequence with high stakes for characters that are easy to invest in the first act of the film admittedly plays out similar to many mainstream ""hero's journey"" tales    an average joe (shang chi) turns out to have a more than average calling and must return to his past in order to keep his father from doing evil things that might cause many innocent casualties  it seems like a combination of ideas that have all been done before  the movie is at its weakest when it sets itself up to be as interesting as the concept of the plot  but for shang chi  the gold is in the execution of this storyline firstly  the characters are interesting from the very start of the movie to the end  so despite the clichés the audience still cares about what happens to every character  including the fantastic villains  the comedic relief is also on point throughout  and the characters all feel personable and colorful due to the life that each actor puts into their performances  simi liu as shang chi is a star in the making  similar to chris evans' turn in the first captain america film  and casting directors all over hollywood will likely have him near the top of their call lists after this  the performance of the film for me  however  is tony leung as shang chi's father and the primary villain  leung plays one of the most lived in and memorable mcu villains since erik killmonger    it is impossible not to feel sympathy for him even though it's clear that he has some serious issues with how he is dealing with his inner demons at the end of the day  i believe shang chi will truly be remembered for the technical mastery put into the action sequences  only time will tell if this statement remains to be true  but it struck me while watching: this film contains the most well filmed action sequences of any live action marvel movie thus far  a high stakes fight scene on a bus about 20 30 minutes into the movie made me realize that the filmmakers weren't messing around with their action: the stunt choreography is phenomenal  the visual effects and cinematography are stunning  and the action set pieces are inventive and pay homage to great asian cinema of the past  the final 30 minutes of shang chi involve one large final battle  and it ranks as one of my favorite final fight scenes in the mcu along with avengers: endgame and infinity war shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is not perfect  especially for those looking for a complete reinvention of what it means to be a superhero movie  it adheres to many of the standards that have already been set up for the genre  but it does so in such a stylish and sleek way that it is difficult not to smile during much of the film  cretton does a fantastic job helming this movie in a way that sets it apart from the projects that came before it  and ends up crafting the avatar: the last airbender movie that i wish we had  superhero movies may be running out of ideas  but if they continue to be crafted this well  then we should expect to see plenty more where this came from b+",Positive
414,i enjoyed watching it  but the movie is overrated  it's ok  but i'm clueless as to why the critics gave this such high ratings  to much hype ,Positive
415,this film is absolutely incredible! it starts with an explanation of the ten rings and really cool accompanying visuals showing it in use it soon proceeds to a even cooler fight between the owner of the ten rings and the woman who would be his wife from there the story progresses rapidly and there is always a bit of action  not to much or to less but just the right amount so that's it's balanced with story and character development in shang chi we are introduced to shang chi and his baby sister  both are awesome characters and the audience will love them  the story itself focuses on their family and the ten rings  it's worked and interconnected exceedingly well the acting in this movie is all round brilliant and the casting was just about perfect! my only gripe would be with awkwafina  whose character and casting seem to included in the movie purely for comedic purposes  i don't find her funny personally and this was one point that was grating on my nerves throughout the movie(this is my own personal preference and opinion  you may find her a perfect casting while i don't )  luckily (simu's) shang chi and his sister (zhang) quickly grab the viewers attention back to them and katy(awkwafina) doesn't affect things to much  though i would honestly not mind seeing more of zhang in future productions special effects  visuals and sounds were spared no expense and i'm glad  they were all amazing  from watching the ten rings activate  listening to the music and soundtrack of the movie to seeing the incredible scenery  my dad especially loved the film with a lot of the tai chi fighting style/mixed martial arts that was employed throughout the film  paying homage to hundreds of years of karate from china/japan etc finally the way the movie introduces chinese culture and legends to a western audience is brilliant; i'm indian myself though born and raised in south africa and loved the culture this movie brought to the big screen  i especially liked the fact that they spoke mandarin when appropriate and has subtitles rather then just using english (my home language) throughout the film  westerners will also most likely enjoy the way the presentation of chinese culture is shown especially in the third act of the film all in all a brilliant work of film from marvel studios  i am definitely going to give it a rewatch soon and am also eagerly awaiting a sequel to the movie!10/10 from me!p  s  if i meet a beautiful asian girl who can kick ass i'm totally marrying her if she will have me xd ,Positive
416,probably the best mcu origin movie since gaurdians  great martial arts action too  no shaky cam! the fight scenes are reminiscent if the older jackie chan movies of the 90s  which makes sense since his choreographer and crew worked on this movie ,Positive
417,i know disney and marvel are linked  but it really did feel more like a disney movie to me  a live action alternative to a pixar animation  it's good  a nice origin story  but seemed quite soft  the main bad guy was good  his guys not so good  the main characters were all very good  some story elements not so good  i'll probably see it again  and might well enjoy it more next time ,Positive
418,or maybe wenwu and the legend of tao lo   felt like it could be better  shang chi barely feel like a main character  he felt like a side kick who got thrown around from point a to b to finish off wenwu's arc shang chi didn't have much struggle  his inner demons of unable to help his mother felt meh because he was just a kid when it happened  it was more of his father's fault for not having any security or maids in the house  its a large house and he is a well off man  i am sure he could afford some security having some security doesn't mean the mom couldn't be killed too  maybe the mom died trying to protect one of the maid or the children  it'll added more stakes and trauma to the poor kids the ten rings were never fully explored too  thought each of them will have unique power  but they just some electric power telekinesis kinda thing  brute force basically  shang chi never expressing wanting to be worthy of the ten rings also makes them hollow  they are just as sentimental as a normal sword  a weapon basically  which is fine but when the movie called shang chi and the ten rings  i expected more ten rings instead of mythical bats and dragon tony leung is amazing though  the opening scene was basically the best  the battle dance between them was so well done it deserves everything     but kung fu panda is still the best martial arts movie ,Positive
419,"great work from'marvel' universe  the movie starts with telling about the powers of the ' ten rings '   "" shang chi "" father who try to conquer all the powers in the world  but he don't know that the voice was not his wife's  it is the voice of a deadly soul eating creature which was locked by the people lived in ""ta lo"" where shang chi mother belongs to  the people lived in "" ta lo"" have the power to defeat the power of ""ten rings ""  overall ""all marvel lover's must watch""

420,if you are like me  from the previews and ads you thought this was a kung fu movie about a son rebelling against his crime lord father and the father sends men to force him to return and make him take over as the next leader of the criminal empire  not an awful plot but not that original either  that is absolutely not what this movie is about  i love and hate that marvel's trailer seldom give anything away and i am glad they are doing it again  that is not at all what this movie is about and i will not spoil anything the performances are good  the story is good and while not complicated  it keeps your interest  funny parts  touching parts  action parts  it is overall just a good movie that was enjoyable to watch  it is not one of the best marvel movies but it is a solid one and worth seeing in the theater ,Positive
421,i like it  its a chinese fighting kung fu more in the mcu  they really dealve deep into the back story and gave the characters life ,Positive
422,literally could not imagine a movie i would recommend to a complete stranger more than this   thing  i don't even know what it is  or how to describe it  just  fenomenal  it took pieces of the marvel universe long forgotten  questions never expected answered  and expanded upon them in such a miraculous way  i have no words  totally shocked in awe  this is the most asian and action packed incredible motion picture in existence  something that makes me proud to be a marvel fan  a cinematic masterpiece  simu liu is an underrated actor  and i'm not just saying that because i had never heard of him until last year  ok  maybe a little bit  but it's still true  3000%,Positive
423,it's forgiven  wasn't too high on this movie after watching the trailers but to my surprise i actually really liked it  the only part i didn't like was the cgi parts in the beginning of the movie  it was the forest scene and bus scene  very cheap cgi ut after that the cgi got better where it didn't botter me anymore  but like i said the rest of the movie i really enjoyed where i first didn't think i would ,Positive
424,watching this movie was kind of a roller coaster  it would pick up then slow down  then pick up and slow down again  but it was an enjoyable movie at the end of the day ,Positive
425,"the first thing that jumps out at you here is how uneven the acting is compared to the usual marvel movies  actors alternate between overacting  pathos and subdued attempts at coolness  add the usual marvel style self referential wink wink humor  and the obligatory 30 minute cgi showdown with purple light themed villains and monster (for the    15th time now?)  and you end up with a jarring  nauseating tonal mess of a movie it's the same movie over and over again  same exact story beats  same pacing  same style soundtrack  same jokes  same trashy special effects laden battle at the end they tried to gimmick things up with kung fu here (because that's apparently what disney think people want to see in movies with an asian cast)  but you've seen it all before dozens of times  and better at that  the martial arts fight in public transport has been done to death (recently quite well in ""nobody""  but also in marvel films like captain marvel)  and in general the fights pale against movies like matrix  john wick or any jackie chan classic the reality is that marvel movies feel dated and played out  with nowhere to go except from one cgi battle to the next  maybe marvel would be better off switching to a series format  because the movies are just reheated microwave dinners at this point save your money for something original ",Positive
426,the movie had some logical issues like why didn't the father take the necklace from his daughter first  he sent the postcard i think the movie was entertaining but the end was bad!shang used the rings better than his 1000 years old father  the father should have helped to beat the soulsucker and then die after sealing it  shang never used the rings (bracelets) before!and then they went home telling their friend about it  surprisingly happily considering how many died (including his father!) ,Positive
427,shang chi is fantastic  it's like a bruce lee movie meets a marvel movie  one of the better marvel movies  i love that they brought back ben kingsley to play trevor  which he was one of my favorite characters in this movie and it is fixing his character as the mandarin in iron man 3  i love that ben kingsley knows that most people didn't like him as the mandarin  the insistence planet of the apes is played by real monkeys is hilarious  i love the mandarin in this movie he was my favorite character in this movie besides  morris  morris is the best character ever  morris is great  the mandarin in this movie is one of my favorite marvel villains ever  the ten rings are very interesting  the bus scene at the beginning is awesome  the opening scene was also quite good  the fighting and the choreography is very well done  the dragons are very cool looking and them fighting was cool  it was nice to see wong in this and it was nice to see him fight the abomination  the action scenes are really cool and simu liu is great as shang chi  i really like his character a lot and his acting is quite good  i really like the plot  it is simple but i really enjoyed it  meng' er zhang is good as xialing as well  my biggest flaw is awkwafina  she isn't as bad in this as she was in raya and the last dragon and she is funny in this some of the time but i just don't think i like her very much  it will be cool to see shang chi return in doctor strange in the multiverse of madness  i really enjoyed this and it was one of the better marvel movies ,Positive
428,i enjoyed the idea  going for a crouching tiger  hidden dragon vibe but it just lacked authenticity  really bad over acting and cheesy action with dated cgi i swapped over to listening to music while watching it and i enjoyed it much better ,Positive
429,"the best parts of the story are those that were set in the usa  as they gave a nice and on point glimpse into the culture of americans of ethnic chinese origin  but as soon as the story moves on to macau  and then to a ""mysterious unknown location in china"" where the ten rings are located  and then even further into the mystical ""chinese"" village called ta lo  the movie missed the mark further and further; and it becomes increasingly obvious that this story is told entirely through an american lens  because the ""chinese"" parts seems more like a flanderized/disney fied version of chinese culture (which isn't very surprising  considering that this movie is produced by disney)  also  while china does have outsized influence on east (and to a lesser extent south east) asian culture (the same way that the influence of ancient roman culture is outsized in regards to europe)  disney seems to think that chinese and asian is basically interchangeable  which is a common perception in hollywood  but not actually true in other words  the last 2/3 parts are an orientalist fantasy version of chinese ish ""culture""  a poor facsimile of chinese ness that's devoid of anything truly chinese in heart or spirit  it (just as many other renditions hollywood has made of ""chinese"" or ""asian"" movies) felt jarringly off the mark that being said  the movie also has its good points  the actors are pretty good and engaging  especially tony leung is on point in his acting  the more dramatic/emotional moments of the story are also properly balanced out by the humor to make this into a nice and quick  lighthearted watch that we all know from marvel's brand  the action at the start is also pretty good  though the last 1/3 part suffers from the usual cgi fest that you can expect from most superhero movies  and there aren't many pacing issues in the movie either all in all  a solid watch for the average marvel fan  but a disappointment for people who are used to seeing asian movies produced by actual asians from asian countries ",Positive
430,any film that has to spend the opening 10 minutes explaining the story/history does not bode well  and if this is the best of marvels phase 4  i generally think marvel must have peaked in phase 3 with the avengers and guardians of the galaxy normally the 'first of movie' has a decent back/origin story  but this film just felt weak on all levels  none of the acting was bad  but i found myself not caring about any of the characters the whole film felt totally disjointed by been told in far too many flash back scenes  numerous times during the movie  someone explains to someone else why something is happening  (so the audience might have some clue as to what is happening)  which normally follows yet another flashback i have thoroughly enjoyed most of the marvel movies  but this one is just so forgettable ,Positive
431,"as far as superhero movies retreading the same ground over and over like a pizza slicer struggling to cut through a dull crust  particularly in the current climate of overdone and overrated marvel movies  shang chi stands on its own as a very fun and endearing film  it takes you on a rollercoaster from humble jokes between friends to fighting brutes on a bus to eventually the epic battle you expected  compared to some marvel movies which are now feeling to make care about who i'm supposed to be cheering for in the first place  shang chi is a much more likeable and worthy movie in carrying out this formula  i think the movie does it perfectly  and i came to like the characters enough to be invested and enchanted by the events  the chinese flavour of the movie helps to give it more rhythm and depth  at least on the surface level still  at the end of the day  this is another overbudgeted blockbuster action movie which makes less sense the further along you watch  given how tight the first half of the movie is  i did find myself taken out of it by the insertion of trevor slattery and the obligatory ""cute little critter that knows everything"" moment  and while the inevitable final battle was very well done and exhilarating  it still exchanged logic and gravity for another slog through a chaotic battlefield of good versus evil  i also wished that shang chi's father would start to make sense by the end of the movie  because he seemed enigmatic and layered at the beginning but came across as a stereotypical tyrant dad by the end so overall  i'd say this movie is definitely worth a watch (and worth the hype) in the sea of superhero movies  it leads the pack in that bunch  but doesn't stray from it   for better and worse ",Positive
432,a little disney goes a long way  and much of this film is pure disney  it's alright but not great  there's the usual disney type story of love and loss  good parent/bad parent and estranged siblings  there's the usual 'cutesy' banter between lead and sidekick and the (very) familiar dynamic between same  there's some very pokémon looking animals and also some creatures that look like they came straight out of the world of warcrafts bestiary  it's very samey and is obviously just a setup for future marvel/disney outings  my enthusiasm is staring to wane for this type of thing  endgame seems so long ago  and it's doubtful if we'll ever see something so monumental from this company again ,Positive
433,this is a great marvel movie  but it wasn't really a shang chi story the script would fit better for an iron fist movie; a secret place in another dimension  guarded by a portal only he can open shang chi wasn't really recognizable  nor was his father and his sister  as these had been completely rewritten from the comics to the movie there was too much magic  never ending story moments  electricity weapons and sci fi for me to relieve the feeling of the kung fu hero of the 70's my plea for further shang chi movies: less special effects  more kung fu ,Positive
434,i'm not gonna lie  the movie didn't impress me much based on the trailer  i still wanted to see it because  well  marvel movies are just fine and i believed it would be good  and it was  it was  the story  in my opinion  wasn't as good as it usually is with marvel  not that marvel has any masterful storylines  but it just wasn't as good in my opinion as some of the other movies that have come out from the studio in the past  what was more than good  on the other hand  was the music in places  but what was without a doubt the best and what marvel has always been able to do and probably always will be able to do is action  the action scenes here are awesome  although then they are not very frequent  there are a few times when the pace slows down and we wait for some of the fights  once it does though  you're in for an epic cgi load of fighting that i devoured  there's still the occasional quirk thrown in here and there  as is usually the case with marvel movies  to sum it up  for me  a good movie that i recommend  and classically to marvel fans ,Positive
435,if you only ever watched one movie at the cinema in your entire span of days  make it this phenomenal sight  sound and super spectacular sensory sensation  smashes everything out of the park! and some ,Positive
436,ultimately this is just a forgettable film  it certainly has its moments and i think it was well made  but the characters are flat and overall the movie misses the excitement that the other origin films had  still  it's a whole lot better than captain marvel   ,Positive
437,shang chi has some gorgeous cinematography  good cgi  good acting and the best depictions of chinese legends i have ever seen on screen but even so it isn't great the problems here are with the writing  shang chi and his best friend katy aren't very likeable characters despite simo liu and awkwafina's best effort to be charming  the main villain xu wenwu is supposedly monstrous yet somehow his story ark makes him less scary and mostly just pitiable  the other characters are mostly good but they are smaller roles the only times i got excited were when we got to see classic chinese legends brought to life and china is where the story should have stayed  the only reason we start in san francisco is to justify speaking english  i did like that they mostly spoke chinese when it was appropriate but they could just have set it in china and spoken english throughout   or even better chinese throughout i wish i could be excited at this new character in the mcu  but it didn't start very promisingly ,Positive
438,i thought this was legend of the ten rings but doesn't tell anything about the rings a lot of cliche and not so funny moments but those will depend on viewer  what i'm unhappy about is the character development  i do not understand why shang chi is so upset at his father  i actually sympathize with the father  shouldn't shang chi feel guilty for doing nothing and just watch his mom die rather than blame his father? and even after he knew his father was being used by the creatures in the dark  he says he'll kill his father???some good action sequence were also negated by bad dragon cg ,neutral
439,wow what a movie i don't know why i left it so late to watch this master piece if you love superhero movies and kung fu movies this movie is definitely for you ,Positive
440,"i ignored the positive reviews for this movie because i just assumed it was marvel fanboys raving about the latest film  i was afraid this was another captain marvel situation  that movie made an insane amount of money at the box office  and i still feel it is one of marvel's worst  i recently watched it a second time to confirm what a dull  formulaic movie it was  so  i assumed shang chi would be the same  i was wrong shang chi is one of marvel's best solo (non avengers) movies  although it has a very long run time  the movie never drags  this is a family drama intertwined with a superhero movie  i always thought captain america winter soldier was a political spy thriller mixed with a superhero movie  they've sort of taken that approach here  remove the superhero and superpowers aspect of shang chi  and you have a fantastic story about love  family  and betrayal this movie has some of marvel's best fight scenes  the visual effects and world building are  for the most part  excellent  the script has just enough comedy  done at the right time  unlike many other marvel movies where the jokes seem forced speaking of the script  this too is one of marvel's best  the family dynamics and history are revealed slowly throughout the movie  this causes the viewer to stay engaged and reflect on past choices that the characters had made i read another review that said something along the lines of ""this movie is a great example of martin scorcese being right that superhero movies are bad "" i feel the opposite  as i said earlier  take out the superpowers  and you have a fantastic family drama  shang chi is an excellent movie  that also happens to be about a superhero ",Positive
441,shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is directed by destin daniel cretton  the movie centres around the ten rings organisation  which is lead by shang chi's father  who is a man that has been consumed by power and greed for thousands of years  this movie received so much praise  with many claiming this is one of the best instalments in the mcu  however after seeing the film  i have to say i was extremely disappointed  easily the worst aspect of the movie is the writing  almost every plot point occurs for no reason but to simply give the audience a purposeless action sequence or provide an exposition dump  to give an example  shang chi's father sends his men to fight his children and we don't have any idea why  the action is cool to look at  and after three lengthy sequences it turns out he just wants them to return to his organisation  we find this out because the father shows up after all the pointless fights  and they just willingly go with him  couldn't he have just shown up at the start of the movie? like that would have been way more efficient for him  basically the entire movie follows this trend  even the fact that he wants his kid's help makes no sense  he didn't actually need them  he has the ten rings and an entire army to fight with  like i get he needed their pendants to reveal a confusing useless map for 3 seconds  but couldn't he have taken the necklaces then left them alone? all this is really unfortunate because the execution of some action sequences are so great  like shang chi's fight with his sister  i love hand to hand combat  but there was no purpose behind the fight  it's like someone just put the scene in because the movie got boring  unfortunately  the movie does not end on a high either  i sat there having to stare at awful green screen and so much cgi  i couldn't help but laugh at it  overall i thought this movie was watchable but extremely disappointing  there was potential to make a great film here  but to me it felt like marvel did not care about the script ,Negative
442,"to begin with  no one on this movie is known or famous  literally no one  they spend a huge amount on production and then a small budget is kept for the actors and actresses  it would have been a blockbuster if they have added some famous names to the movie to make matters most  why would you hire aquafina in an action movie  it is just mind blowing  she just doesn't fit in the movie  she always have a dumb look on her face which translates into ""what in the world am i doing here?!""  what is worse than that is her ridiculous lime green pants which she doesn't change for the entire length of the movie  disappointing movie ",Positive
443,personally this is top 3 comic movie as a fan of chinese cinema from the 70's onwards the martial arts in this film was fluid now if only dc would do a kung fu based film  it's got by far the greatest martial arts masters on its roster shiva  david cain  bronze tiger  karate kid  casandra cain  richard dragon and on and on maybe a real film of soul of the dragon ,Positive
444,from beginning to end i enjoyed this movie  it is well done  the characters are well written and honestly  i would love to see more shang chi and other characters in future marvel movies and tv shows  i love how phase 4 is going so far  i can not wait to see more of the expanding marvel cinematic universe in movies and tv shows  overall  fantastic film!,Positive
445,"""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" is one of the best productions of marvel studios  i had very big expectations for this movie and it didn't disappoint  mostly because it's based on asian people and martial arts and i am a very big fan of this genre  only the idea to make a marvel's movie which is based on martial arts is very interesting  even if there are already some comics on which this movie is based on the movie has all you could expect from a movie made of marvel  but the special effects and the cgi are the strongest points of this one  i even regret it that i didn't watch it in a cinema  because it's clear that the movie has been made to put into the light the enormous ammount of special effects  on a big screen  i've also been impressed by the acting and even the storyline it's not bad  it's clear enough that is has been put a lot of effort in the well making of this movie and it seems to me that they really achieved what they've wanted to ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" it's a movie that shines through it's cgi  acting and storytelling ",Positive
446,"i watched this movie last night and it was really really epic i feel like i was in shang chi world (ta lo) was so beautiful  so many beautiful and unique creatures  i didn't expect that shang chi would be so good and so epic like this  but sometimes the cgi it looks like not done  but it was okey cause they give us the best visual  i was really proud that niki and rich brian was in shang chi soundtrackwhen mandarin acting died i was really sad but when that little creature come to him  and mandarin was said ""it was acting  come on pretend to be die"" and that was so funnythe ending was look like godzilla vs kong maybe cause the monster and the monster was fighting and shang chi weapon was so strong  and it's kinda sad cause his dad die in front of shang chi this movie it doesn't feels like 2 hours but it's feels like 1 hours and i really really really wanna watch this movie again so bad  i can't wait for the sequel  edit : and now i watched this movie again 3 times i really recommend you to watch this movie on cinemas now!  cause you will feel like you go to ta lo shang chi beautiful fantasy place  and don't forget to watch those two credit scene cause the credit scene was surprising me and can't wait to see another movie from marvel cinematic universe (mcu) ",Positive
447,shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is a superhero movie  it's a part of the next phase of the mcu as first we need to look up the major role  which shang chi and the legend of the ten rings has to fulfill  it's a whole new franchise and has to introduce a new universe  new characters and a new superhero for the mcu  that's not that easy  to accomplish all of these duties and create a good piece of art  but shang chi and the legend of the ten rings definitely did it pretty well the new universe and the new characters getting introduced very pleasant  there is no rushing or plot gaps  also the origin story is kinda complex  but still interesting  there are many different interrelations between the characters i mostly enjoyed the different fighting scenes  cause the cgi was brilliant and there was no shaky cam  the camera was focused on the different fights and never was getting shaky or blurred  this causes  that every fight was very intense  i guess especially in 3d in the cinema the movie could be stunning it's kinda hard for me to describe the plot  but in general shang chi and the legend of the ten rings follow a basic superhero story  we have different heroes and different antagonist  which fight against each other  of course there are different backgrounds  but they just fulfill the story from my point of view shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is a very catchy mcu movie  it's also a great movie to represent the asian chinese culture in america and in superhero movies ,Positive
448,this movie's biggest strength is the action  it is so well choreographed and so well captured in camera that it is unlike any movie i've seen  that aside  the characters are solid and give depth to the family dynamic at the heart of the story  where it fumbles is in the third act that feels like it contrasts a lot that it tried to set up in order to have an over the top fantastical element to the show  overall very enjoyable and is probably the most appealing marvel movie since black panther ,Positive
449,don't believe the hype this movie was just as good as black widow    which is not good at all ,Positive
450,i enjoyed shang chi  as far as origin stories go in the mcu  this one was one of the better ones  it doesn't quite feel like a marvel film but that's okay because it's still great the action scenes are inspired  it's almost a homage of sorts to the classic style of fighting made popular by chinese cinema  but very well executed  tony leung delivers a standout performance as one of the best villains in the entire mcu thus far  the look of the film is excellent too with some great cgi and beautiful cinematography this is another hit for marvel  and a surprising one at that too ,Positive
451,i was really looking forward to this movie after seeing the trailer  i decided to wait until it comes out on disney+ what i saw surprised me deeply  this is a chinese story that was probably made up by marvel  in the movie there are a lot of fantastic beings which i really liked  the more i liked that it was a kind of karate movie  when i think about it  that was something new when it comes to marvel  the main character seems personable and it's fun to watch his story unfold  what i can tell you is that this tells the story of how shang chi got the ten rings  it is worth mentioning that the hero gained sympathy with me through his dealings with his best friend to come to the conclusion i would like to say that this movie is very good and deserves more recognition  ten stars from me because it's a movie i've been waiting for ,Positive

doctor strangenote: as i always say marvel and dc films can really only be compared to one another  within their own segment of the movie industry  but even if i were to compare ""shang chi"" to any other film  it would have been a 9/10 a perfect marvel movie  trust me  i've watched all 25 of them and the only marvel films that come close to the richness of story  character development and sheer epicness of shang chi are doctor strange  thor ragnarok and the last two avengers  the film perfectly balances story and character development with action scenes so that throughout the whole two hours you never get tired of neither  there are no unnecessary filler scenes  there aren't any 40 min long scenes explaining the childhood background of the main character you sometimes see in such films; the flashbacks of the past are smartly intertwined as short clips within the overarching main story  the fights are absolutely amazing  obviously inspired by jackie chan and bruce lee moves (with a pinch of kill bill)  the story is as deep and as personal as it can get for a marvel film (honestly better than most drama films nowadays); and some scenes are as epic and vast as the final battles in endgame or the last hobbit movie  this is what mulan and raya should have looked like  and the great thing is that it doesn't rely on any of the previous marvel movies whatsoever   a fully standalone project with completely new characters you must watch it in a theater if you can ",Positive
453,the movie looks great but   the story and how it is being moved forward is so predictable i could almost call out every 'event' before they even happened marvel is a in a creative rut  every movie they put out is 'pretty and shallow'  i mean  i like empty calories as much as the next person   but that doesn't mean i can sit and eat a pound of it   which is exactly what watching a marvel movie translates to 2/10 wish i had watching something completely different ,Positive
454,i was super excited to see this movie and boy  it doesn't disapoint!! visually  it's incredible  i really enjoyed the comedy factor  ben kingsley is always a joy to watch!! i'm a huge mcu fan and this movie is in my top 5 to watch for sure  i cant wait for further installments  acting is impeccable by all involved! well done marvel!,Positive
455,this is definitely perfect intro for new character with amazing fighting sequence   great vfx and average storyline with savage performances     must watch for all fans and also non fans!,Positive
456,it's beautifully shot and cinematography and locations excellent  i was a bit confused by the ending but that's alright i guess  they did quite good on the worldbuilding but as someone who has watched a ton of chinese dramas with richer worldbuilding and characters it didn't amaze me a decent mcu movie in its own right they just should've made this earlier  like before iron man 3 (?) or something ,Positive
457,this movie was really different  it introduced some awesome characters with the awesome 10 rings weapons  seeing them being used was cool  there are some great characters and the villain is great  the film looks beautiful and the effects are good  some people might say some of the magical looking stuff looks fake  but magic does not exist so i think a film writer or book writer should be able to show their own perception of magic the film was pretty strait forward and simple  it didn't follow the same in a way  template as the other mcu movies but i like that  this movie introduced this great side to the mcu and i'm exited to see shang chi's part in the mcu forwards ,Positive
458,loved every minute of it  mixhelle yeoh  simu liu  awkwafina all the stars i iove he dragons were amazing  but morris erm not so mych great sfx and story line ,Positive
459,good movie up till the end of the macau scene  the rest of the movie turns into a childish flying dragon fantasy show  it's hard to give this anything higher than a 7  the early scenes are good enough to get the 7 with the rest of the movie bombing ,Positive
460,amazing storytelling  kinda cliche plot  amazing acting  and most importantly  excellent presentation of it all action movies are famously bad at explaining various plots  be it how some things happen  how some scenes seem to inexplicitly changed to something drastically different  plot holes and so on  but shang chi is probably one of the best in terms of both emotions and action  in the marvel series being an asian  and especially chinese centric film  it is not surprising to find asian values being incorporated inside the movie  what's surprising though  is how a lot of the movie is actually in the chinese language  granted  non english speaking viewers will not be able to grasp the full meaning of some of the phrases used  a case of lost in translation  and some might even find the rampant use of mandarin off putting for a global audience  most of who probably do not know mandarin  and due to some political sensitivities  no less but outside of any prejudice or language barriers  this movie is indeed amazing in its own right  the acting of most if not all of the characters inside were really excellent  especially the facial expressions and the form of the martial arts  a lot of which seem to be referenced off tai chi the movie does have flaws  like the use of a foreign language for a mostly english speaking global audience  or some explanations lacking  which is partly covered by the end credits  but the way it set up the interactions between characters and the plotlines is really masterful one of a kind  especially given today's sensitiveness on political correctness ,Positive
461,i'd only just seen spider man: no way home when i decided to stay in the marvel universe and watch this  wow! this blows spider man and the convoluted and confusing multiverse out of the water  this was fresh  fantastic and unexpected with a bit more depth than the usual marvel flick (most all of which i love)  the acting and action/fight scenes were excellent  a great mix of family drama and some fine humor to lighten certain periods of the film  i didn't want it to end  highly recommend! i gave it a 10 because it was a stunning watch for us even at home and because imo it's one of the top tier mcu films ,Positive
462,film is great overrall  same story we all know but the way it told is engaging and emotional  first thing i loved in this movie is action sequence  every action scene is so damn good  the soundtrack is amazing  the characters are well written  even a smaller role is kinda memorable  vfx is great but not in high standards in final climax  its not that messy but notable  there are two credits scenes dont miss that  it does what it meant to do(entertainment)  cant wait for further mcu movies ,Positive
463,as a chinese person living in australia  watching shang chi was an uncomfortable experience  not unexpectedly  they resorted to the tired tropes of king fu/martial arts and eastern mysticism as if that is all chinese culture is about  unlike black panther  where they envisioned a futuristic african kingdom  shang chi would not be out of place in 15th century china  it is exasperatingly unimaginative and reductive  if they were to apply the same treatment to the white heroes of the marvel universe  we would be watching either a western or a bunch of heroes/villains who are supremely adept at colonizing new territories  subjugating their local populace and stealing their wealth  instead of the diversity and inclusivity that they might have intended  this feels more like opportunism/tokenism disguised as benevolence  disney  do better ,Positive
464,you like jackie chan  you like marvel     you'll probably like this film  the martial arts in this film are top notch  along with all the excitement  goofy humour and special effects expected from a marvel movie  pure popcorn fun ,Positive
465,now don't be misled by my title i loved shang chi but lack of innovation is now really showing in marvel movies  no matter how good a formula is it will give diminished results with time yet it's a great one time watch the cast has carried this movie literally from shang chi  katy and even a very likable villain ,Positive
466,i think this was ok  not as bad as black widow  or iron man 2  but definitely in the bottom tier of the mcu marvel seems to have forgotten what made most of phases 1 3 so much fun     the movies used to clever  funny  and while far fetched  at least consistent this flick is all over the map  marvel is trying so hard to be woke enough for twitter  that they are not focused on quality anymore  black panther ruled not because the cast was almost all black  it ruled because it was an awesome movie that happened to have a mostly black cast i feel like these characters desired more than muddled messy film so focused on spotlighting how cool marvel is for focusing on asian casting  instead of started from  let's tell a good story first  and cast it with the right representation hopefully  phase 4 and beyond will get better  but so far   i think marvel may be at the end of its ability to dominate cinemas ,Positive
467,all marvel movies recently have been the same  same formula same template same type of comedy same type of scenes   this is something new and it was actually fresh  visuals r also great ,Positive
468,shang chi  the second movie from mcu's phase 4 is a typical mcu movie but this time with some chinese martial arts that provides a different feel to some extent  well choreographed martial arts sequences that are shown throughout the movie is the main factor that makes the film watchable  village visuals that depict a chinese culture to a small extent is another factor to watch out for  the movie does not have any particular acting performances worth praising yet tony leung's decent portrayal of a simple yet complex villain and simu liu's attitude as shang chi makes them right choices for their roles  also surprise return of a familiar character and well designed cgi creatures adds to the pros of the film still shang chi is dragged down due to a lot of factors including a average predictable plot  flawed vfx which is spotted the most during the third act degrades the movie quality a lot than expected  the movie fails to provide the goosebumps that a typical mcu movie provides  last but not the least the shared universe scenes look forced compared to the well directed post credit sequence shang chi :the legend of ten rings is a satisfying martial arts fest but a disappointment when it comes to a mcu movie rating:63%,Negative
469,i am no longer a fan of superhero movies as i was in the past  this is a prelude to a full tie in to mcu which is the only reason i watched it before it gets lost in that mess while i enjoyed the story of the fantasy village of ta lo  it will be a shame to see them wrapped into mcu  i would much rather see characters such as thor in asgard  black panther in wakanda  spiderman in queens etc  i think that's where their stories flourish and not get watered down as bit parts i understand packing in as many superhero characters into a movie guarantees there is something for everyone  fans that prefer to follow their favorite hero lose out in these money grabs this movie was not too sophisticated and relied on visuals to carry the movie  i really enjoyed the comedy pairing of the leads  unfortunately  i doubt they will make another shang chi movie which is too bad ,Positive
470,a bit drawn out with lots of flashbacks what's with those 10 rings? there's never any backstory nice fight scenes and liked the creature at the end ,Positive
471,everything about this movie was amazing!! if you haven't watched  watch  now  my only problem is that they didn't really use that many characters that were hyped up  such as the death dealer and the abomination ,Positive
472,not a big marvel fan or superhero film fan so i was never going to love this  but having liked the last 3 spider man's and hearing good things about this as well as being stuck with 16hrs flying i decided to watch it on the planes built in system wasn't particularly impressed  too far fetched for me to enjoy and i just didn't enjoy the story the headless creature and scouse guy were interesting additions  it is watchable if you're not expecting much overall  i wouldn't recommend unless you love extremely far fetched non fiction superhero movies ,Positive
473,"how shang chi is disney's way of uniting the world
i had heard that the movie was mediocre and was originally apprehensive  but went ahead with it after one of my friends said that he enjoyed it  i would have missed it  had it not been for the chance encounter with anushka (as i had not gotten my protein at the fitness park stall)i am glad i took his advice and met her the movie has a storyline that is believable with the motivations of the villain very realistic  the poor guy only wanted to relive his glory days with his family (kind of like the kingpin in ""spiderman into the spiderverse"")  he was holding on to the emotion for longer than intended  tony leung is a spectacular actor and portrays an immense amount of emotion through his eyes  it was a pleasure to watch his scenes
awkwafina breathes happiness into every scene that she is a part of michel yeoh really shows to us what a mature actor looks like but the one who takes the cake is ben kingsley  his scenes  especially the one where he describes his motivation for becoming an actor are gold maybe a movie on an indian marvel superhero off the comics paras gavaskar (the jain mutant who practices non violence but want to stop evil)  dinesh deol (an engineer capable of psychokinesis) or paras gavaskar  shakti haddad (the brilliant expert in genetics who can locate mutants  and manipulate nervous systems) is not too far ",Positive
474,right from the start i realised that the plot structure and storyline was very standard and repetitive  it's seen in many other action/superhero films  but as the action kicked in  i was still invested  it's a very fast paced movie with some new action sequences we haven't seen in the mcu yet  as well as some good comedic moments  the choreography for the action is one of the best i've seen in a long time  very long cuts show all the action without quick cuts after every move someone takes  it's also a very beautiful film i thought in terms of scenery and colours  music was also great  epic score and some killer songs  definitely check out the soundtrack  but as the film entered its long third act  the ending was very underwhelming  we are being thrown at with so much stuff in a short period of time  so the reveals of some things and actions aren't as interesting as they should of been  but the film has opened up even more possibilities for what's to come in the mcu timeline  so make sure to stay for those credits scenes  but even someone who hasn't seen any or a few mcu films can watch this as it's a good standalone film  they may not understand a few things that characters talk about regarding previous events but i could assume that they'd still be invested  overall  a solid entry for our new character shang chi in the mcu  as well as having some awesome action  funny moments and eye popping miss en scene ,Positive
475,that's all i have to say about it  since i stopped watching cause i slept in the middle of it  childish with a lot of clichés  maybe a ten year old will find it amazing  but it's definitely not made for adults ,Positive
476,i actually enjoy the movie i didn't hate it or love it  it has a few to many slow parts for my personal like i was extremely hype to see it got there started off amazingly got to the beginning of the middle and the middle of the middle of the movie it was just to many dry/slow parts at that point for me lucky that's when they hit with the dragon eyes and the mandarin saves at that point for me just enough to give me a little more energy to stay up i was dozing off lmao i actually love the layers of his father to me it seemed more of his story then his story and how the lost of his wife actually is the reason why he did what he did and to show no matter how much you battle you conquer destroy take over love is all powerful and even the most powerful individuals are weak when it comes to love and can be easily manipulated when it comes to love i dislike the father at first until you see his reason behind it then you actually hurt for him because he wants his wife so bad to the point some things he refused to see because he wants his with that bad  and it actually outshine his son backstory the ending of the movie most definitely save the movie to me because it was action but not enough action to me it should have been a lot more action the movie seem to be slightly rush in some area the end credits mmm to be blunt the first end credit should have been last and the last end credit should have been first i love the empowerment of women it should have been done better they touched on their culture very well with the daughter and sons one not look at the same as the other and i love how they made effort to touch on the urban culture as well with the music buuuuut a lil overkill for the most part i give it a 7 because it just takes you out around the middle a little to much the slow/dry parts was to much not enough action and i wouldn't pay my money again to go back and look at it again but i will buy it  when it comes out in 4k but only if it's on sale i couldn't get in to it like i wanted to i would say go out and see it very amazing movie ,Positive
477,this is ok movie   after along time  new hero arrives  not bad willing to watch till the end  fantasy type of a vibe  good music and background score  must watch in a theatre  amazing effects  but the end is little bit    not enough type ,Positive
478,everything comes in it beautiful science fiction and beautiful mythical creatures  sometimes you have creatures that don't seem real  but these just seemed real  well done! there was a bit of avatar feeling in it  fighting for the safekeeping of peace  really beautiful  and self acceptance was also nicely incorporated ,Positive
479,this had so much potential that got sadly wasted the few fight scenes in the first half were better in quality compared to the usual marvel quick cut edited ones  they were mildly reminiscent of the matrix fights( the intro to the shangchi theme music even sounded suspiciously similar to furious angels from matrix reloaded and made me miss the matrix films more)however  anything positive about the film ends in the first half only with the second half culminating in a bloated cgi mess that is the hallmark of almost all marvel movies  in fact  between shangchi and black widow  i'd say the latter featured much better visual effects which would have looked better on the big screen than this  shangchi would have been a more apt as a direct to video release )it didn't also help that the lead actor was a complete void of charisma honestly  i am just going to watch some jackie chan movies now to now to help deal with the kung fu cravings this movie initiated in me but failed to deliver ,Positive

481,run of the mill marvel movie with subpar acting and the weakest humour of all  the female sidekick best friend was nothing but annoying and you don't care about any of the characters  not a single character had charisma or was memorable  overall another sign of weakening quality from marvel ,Positive
482,excellent cast  story was fine  jokes were funny  action was well filmed and you could see what was actually happening (snake eyes  take note)  much better than black widow ,Positive
483,so the ten rings were just found? doesn't seem like any one knows the origin of the ten rings and if they were so powerful and obviously important  why hasn't any one or anything come looking for them in the 1000+ years? like black widow  its watchable and enjoyable but don't look for any mcu answers  as this seems to be just a filler until the proper mcu shows are released ,Positive
484,amazing  my favorite marvel movie so far  great choreography and acting  perfect cast and non stop fun ,Positive
485,although i found some of the backstory to be unnecessary  shang chi is a fun  action packed adventure  and a welcome marvel newcomer  simu liu and awkwafina make a great team and i look forward to seeing future adventures ,Positive
486,shang chi is at its core a product placement for the chinese market without any vision or necessity to exist  extremely poorly directed and poorly written movie that failed to balance its tone for the entirety of its runtime  a poorly shot low budget attempt to imitate martial arts movies of the past devoid of any soul  compelling characters or even good action  ridiculous random radio music selection that makes no sense and a plot although not the worst was easily one of the biggest wasted potentials in the mcu thus far  the movie was a disservice to shang chi  the mandarin and the rings itself  a movie without a shred of respect for the comics that inspired it instead focuses on how to make the chinese market happy and not ban it  easily the worst mcu movie till now by quite a margin rating: 4 5/10 ,Negative
487,"i very much appreciate the effort  the special effects department did an amazing job but the movie in general failed to get me hooked katy is one very annoying wannabe sidekick  so loud and pushy the story evolves too slow the fight scenes felt like i watched a jackie chan movie   just endless  no offense and
the cast  for me  just lacks an enormous amount of emotion but on the other hand  it's nice to see some fresh faces  a new hero  a new beginning  so make with that review what you want ",Positive
488,watched the imax version! best solo since iron man (2008)! i had no expectations of this before  but the movie is much more lively  enjoyed every moment  and also very engaging from start to finish  a kinda cute action movie with some fun stuff!this is the first movie that focuses more on martial arts than marvel's superpower thing  love to see a mix of marvel's master level cgi with martial art  kung fu with this kind of visual effect! marvel nailed it again i've always loved marvel's casting  katy is too perfect for her role  loved her chemistry with shaun  also laughed out loud at her childish stuffs just one thing  not a big deal  the action scene of 'dragon riding' doesn't fit into the usual marvel movie  but as chinese flavor  it is ok  except for this  the cinematography and vfx are a lot mesmerizing!,Positive
489,the buzz was high on this film but i kept my expectations modest  it started off as a charming story  well told and authentic  the action  and the acting were fine  then the action dipped a little in the middle  but  once shang chi and his gang escaped the stronghold of the 10 rings  the movie really took off  it was a magnificent freaking story  the legend  the fighting  the story  and the tremendous acting were all there  this is as good an mcu movie as there ever was  i was totally blown away by it  it was a great idea to have top actors in the movie and let them do their thing  the leads simu liu and akwafina are solid but the burden of carrying the movie isn't entirely placed on their shoulders  their parents and auntie (tony leung  fala chen  and michelle yeoh) have to do some of the dramatic heavy lifting ,Positive
490,not only does shang chi and the legend of the ten rings expand the mcu further and introduce new concepts for the future  but it delivers some badass choreographed action scenes and an emotionally complex villain ,Negative
491,i love shang chi!  this is amazing marvel superhero asian movie  the ten ring reference showing in iron man 1 2 and 3  marvel one shot & ant man  mandiri character was amazing has previously on iron man 3  and visual fighting so awesome!! (also including abomination & wong)rating: 9/10 ,Positive
492,"should have been called ""shang chi and his sister fight with their dad  then a little bit of other stuff happens""  i mean sure that seems a long title but it's only 5 words longer than the mouthful they went with those 14 words sum the plot up accurately and perhaps more importantly entirely  don't go into this expecting anything beyond those 14 words  you won't find it  instead you'll find a hollow movie  with needless use of subtitled mandarin and not a single original concept anywhere if this were a stand alone movie not trying to link itself in with a broader universe it would have had the freedom of better writing instead we get something that makes snakes on a plane look like an in depth drama  this is not a good movie and the presence of chinese capital funding it's creation is everywhere ",Positive
493,this movie is the best origin story in the mcu since doctor strange and spider man: homecoming (if you count that as a origin story)it had action  lots of surprising comedy  and phenomenal and stunning shots that made my jaw dropexcited to see more and more of simu liu in the mcu (he might be my new favorite),Positive
494,don't believe the praise for this movie  marvel fans who liked it have got to be kidding  they always trash dc movies but they liked this? i don't get it  but then that is typical coming from marvel fans  it is not the shang chi i remember from the 70's comics  it would have been better if it took place in the 70's and had more of an enter the dragon vibe  what we get is anything but  it has some good action scenes  the best being with shang fighting men on a bus  but then it has ben kingsley who was out of place in it and a furry creature called morris that was stupid and unnecessary and should have been ommitted from the movie  it's like a furry pig with wings with no head or face that makes sounds like an ewok or gizmo from gremlins  so dumb  there are some amusing moments but then i find it irritating that something funny has to be thrown in at odd moments  like most marvel films  give it a break  please  the ending is something out of a rodan  godzilla movie  when watching this i thought is this really a marvel movie or a b movie from made in japan  i did like the first half of shang chi  the second half was just ok  i saw it free because i had a free ticket from my club card  i'm glad i did  even when i saw the trailer i wasn't expecting anything  i can see why  my opinion is to see this on tv  it is not one of marvel's best  and those who praise it and say that it is are kidding themselves  gimme a break ,Positive
495,shang chi and the legend of the ten rings takes place some time after avengers endgame is the beginning of phase four of the marvel cinematic universe shang chi is an alright movie  it has some great fight scenes with some incredible fight choreography and epic large scale battles  it is also has some good comedic scenes that made me laugh a couple of times  where shang chi suffers is when it comes to the plot  i didn't find the story very compelling and i didn't get that attached to the characters  it's a story that i feel has been done many times before shang chi wasn't for me but it's comedy and fight scenes make up for some of it's flaws  if you are familiar with the marvel franchise i assume you somewhat know what to expect and for you i can recommend it  although the movie isn't that great  i still think it's good enough to the point of where it's worth watching just to keep up with the larger plot of the mcu  for those not invested in the mcu  i don't believe that this movie is the one you should start with ,Positive
496,"there are flaws in every film  but ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" was a breath of fresh air for the mcu i thought that it would be a western style plot to portray eastern lore  yet i was pleasantly surprised  the amount of action was typical of marvel's style and was certainly overdone at the start when the plot could have moved along a little faster  but there were also moments where you were simply allowed to breathe they took the time to show character interactions that made people's bonds with one another believable and made me care about awkwafina's character  katy had almost none of marvel's standard comic relief character flaws and instead had mostly delightful interactions with shang  there were gorgeously slowed down scenes that showed the more peaceful flow of movement of the ta lo people  and finally  the story was told cyclically with constant breaks back into flashbacks  rather than linearly  this less formulaic approach to storytelling left a lasting impression on me one flaw (according to me): the instigator of the conflict is a situation in which the father can be duped by a mere voice  which is not entirely credible given that he has lived for over a thousand years and would have had to be smarter than that to have survived this long  if his grief over his wife's death had been more recent  it would have been more convincing as a motivator for his lack of critical thinking i won't go into too many more details  overall  this is a very good film  it may not be everyone's cup of tea  but as someone who enjoys eastern media for its emphasis on character interactions  familial/friend love  cyclical storytelling  and  on occasion  complex solutions to problems  this was a nice homage to that ",Positive
497,it makes the terrible mulan movie look like a decent one  it is truly bad  i have no idea how it was given the green light  ridiculous characters thin as a victoria secret model  most boring hero ever  not a hero basically  terrible ,neutral
498,i have low expectation for this one but this movie proved i am wrong  this movie exceed my expectations in all aspect  they got great heart touching story  funny moments (a lot of funny scene  i can hear people laugh here and there  i love how awkwafina can be both funny and beautiful at the same time  i became her fans in this movie)  great costumes  moral of the story  etc this is only my personal opinion but i think the mc is kinda flat in personality  i can't really sympathy with him  the sidekicks in this story have more interesting background or personality (for ex  katy  the little sister/xiangling  the father) than the mc the only downside that really disappointing is the final battle because they overuse cgi and the cgi looks like a cheap budget movie  the best fighting scene they have is the fight in the bus ,Positive
499,this movie was start to finish pure entertainment and it did not disappoint  beautiful choreography and visually stunning  o and that ending wow it was like a dance of visual effects almost mind numbingly beautiful like a trance hats off to everyone involved in this 100% pure entertainment ,Positive
500,a few decent fight scenes but thats about it the gci dragon must have been drawn by a 5 year old kid proper hammy acting and a chronic script if you like a decent marvel film give this one a big miss ,Positive
501,very enjoyable addition to the marvel franchise the lead actors are excellent and the storyline picks up pace i particularly like the us action sequences sequel looks primed    ,Positive
502,the good  this film blends all of it's genres in very nicely  it is one part martial arts  one part family drama and one part fantasy  one of the things the mcu is good at is telling stories from different genres and making them fit within the universe and this film does exactly that  this has some of the best fight sequences within the mcu  the dynamic between shang chi and awkwafina's character has a very nice dynamic between the two and really play of each other  all of the characters play a part into the story and none of them really feel pushed to the side  the villain is also one of the better ones we have in the mcu as he has these conflicting values and we see both his good and bad side  it also isn't very predictable to see what he is going to do next  finally the director feels like they were given a lot more freedom than usual inside mcu films because of how the story is told there hasn't been many films that have been told in this sort of style or tackling these sort of issues  this movie feels like a significant film into the mcu and moving forward in the mcu which was one of my issues with 'black widow'  overall it delivered everything you want from an mcu film plus some new stuff which i enjoyed the mixed  the humour made me laugh and i found some of it funny  but there is a lot of forced mcu humour  if you are one of them people who are tired from the quick one liners we have in the mcu then this movie is going to frustrate you the bad  one of the biggest problems is the mcu template in the sense that it has to have all these jokes  a massive cgi battle at the end and has to tie into the mcu in different ways  some of the humour works in the moment but others just fell so forced overall thoughts  overall 'shang chi' is a exciting mix of the mcu  martial arts  family genre and fantasy  i loved the martial arts aspect but you can tell the mcu formula trying to cheapen the experience a little bit  however put it all together you get yet another mcu film that knows what's coming next  yet not quite a top teir mcu movie  overall i'm going to give shang chi a 8/10 ,Positive
503,the problem with this movie is not that was that bad except few scenes   but was too boring   not interesting !,Negative
504,"if it wasn't for the over use of the marvel ""comedy"" that they always force into these movies and the terrible cgi  this could have been one of the best marvel movies yet but disney seems too stubborn to deviate from the generic formula they use for their movies ",Neutral
505,i guess never since same formula will get them those coins  have you feel you seen one superhero movie so you see them all? they even did this with wandavision  a story about some psycological trauma  they made it at the final arc a total blash of explotions with high velocity fight scenes totally messy unable to understand what is happening so people just give up and wish end fast!     the rest of the movie was really really good! visually the fight scenes were so nice  isnt deep but was good  until last 30 mins     please make a final fight less messy disney  they dont all need flashy lights in all the rainbows and explotions   is just cheap and predictable ,Positive
506,tony  fala and simu had an absolutely phenomenal performance in this fantastic movie  it's so nice to see more representation of different cultures  this movie did for the asian community what black panther did for the african american community the action scenes were one of the best of the any marvel movie  the choreography was by far the best in any marvel movie  this movie felt like ip man with a mythical story added to it  the action was impeccable  the story was unique and wasn't very generic  i love that simu does his own stunts too marvel never ceases to amaze me  we need more company like this *cough cough warner bros and sony cough cough*so thankful we're getting two more!,Positive
507,seriously  wtf ? except a perfect commercial for bmw it's nothing but a good watch for a ten year old kid  for a grownup it's a good comedy if your high as a mthrfckr ,Positive
508,there's nothing negative about it  there's just nothing that blows me away about it too  but i'd like to believe that the next one will be much better  it has so much potential for greatness ,Positive
509,the best marvel movie after endgame  the story is a bit cliché but the rest is absolutely amazing  the fight scenes are the best in the mcu in my opinion  simu liu as shang chi is perfectly chosen and all the other characters are nice and the all the actors do a good job  act 3 is on another level that we haven't seen before in mcu and the visual effects are spectacular  by far one of the best origin stories from marvel!,Positive
510,"black widow kicked off phase 4 with relatively muted excitement  blame bw's performance on the pandemic  pirating  whatever  but for a movie that's several years overdue and months delayed  it was an underwhelming opening to the next step of the mcu both in story quality and action directing shang chi does a lot of heavy lifting and bounces phase 4 back to marvel's in form output with one of the strongest origin story films yet  a combination of a great cast and actor chemistry  palatable plot and storytelling  and the vibrant beauty of chinese & chinese american culture interwoven naturally into the interactions between characters makes shang chi an incredibly fun film for anyone not up to date on the mcu and an instant favorite for any die hard mcu fans  and yet  even with each strong component that this film brings to the table  the most noteworthy highlight is that shang chi has managed to seamlessly adapt kung fu choreography into the best hand to hand fight choreography that the mcu has ever seen  (yes  in my opinion  it's better than the fight choreo from ca:winter soldier; that's no small feat)  the action sequences here  backed by a well fitting and punchy soundtrack make the action of shang chi almost as exciting as that of the best avengers movies not a perfect film by any means  some of the story elements are not fully developed and we also have the scheduled 3rd act cgi battle that seems to come with every mcu movie  even so  the highs certainly outweigh the lows and in all  highly recommend seeing this movie  my thoughts are too cluttered by the awe inspired by the movie so a quick recap of the pros:great action (no seriously  really great action  this is the john wick of superhero films)stunning visualsgreat soundtrackgreat cast  very fun interactionstony leung is incredible in this movie; the antagonist of this film is a top 3 mcu ""villain""simu liu seems like a really great guy  congrats on the success my dude ",Positive
511,i didn't have the highest hopes for the first film of the new phase of marvel characters post avengers  but similar to the first ant man i was pleasantly surprised  you know with marvel the entertainment will be big with colourful action scenes with sharp humour  and this film delivers in spades the main character shang chi is a solid lead with a strong back story and the film builds at a decent pace to its conclusion  also a couple of great cameos from previous films  with one of the most ridiculous characters of the marvel cinematic universe absolutely hilarious and getting the best lines of the film  there was a female comedic foil in this film  but unlike the thor movies (all of them) she never got annoying the film is worth seeing for the bus fight alone  which is one of the best action sequences i've seen in a while  although we're so spoilt for choice these days it perhaps won't stand out like it should minor spoiler alert   the bad part of the film is the sister  because she's just a bit ridiculous   firstly she learnt just by watching and imitating the men do martial arts now anyone who knows learning any kind of sport is the best way to get good is to do  not watch  and she also started a fight club  in macau  on her own? which streams on the   dark web? (it is a movie  maybe i expect too much)  also the post ending scene bringing in the two most annoying avengers characters being quite annoying didn't get my hopes up for the next films by now you know the marvel formula  if that's your thing  like it is mine  it won't disappoint ,Positive
512,this is a great movie with great fight scenes  however i didnt like the part with the mythical/mystical creature fights  the movie is kinda predictable in the manner that all marvel first films feature a villain with simmilar powers to the hero  shang chi has a sister and a friend and are going to meet his sister it is a story of family conflict and drama ,Positive
513,this new marvel movie is just bad  the main actor can't act and it's more about the side characters then him ,Positive
514,"i'm super happy to say that marvels newest movie outing  ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings""  is a hilarious  action packed  cgi thrill ride and it's a fantastic one at that  after seeing ""black widow"" i was worried that marvel/disney had started shifting their focus to their very ambitious tv mini series projects and left the quality of their movies behind  i'm now confident that isn't the case  here  sets  visuals  costumes  choreography  score  acting and directing are all top notch  each shot feels fresh and visually stunning  each joke and emotion land  and the action is amazing  the first big set piece involving shang chi (simu liu) and his best friend (awkwafina)  is a bus ride to work gone horribly wrong  it hooks you instantly and has you either in awe with its incredible fight choreography or laughing at the perfectly timed jokes  it really doesn't let up in either category going forward  i can't believe how much i loved the pairing of these characters  their choice to not make it romantic and i love how different and real they feel from other characters in the mcu  often marvels problem has been their reliance on the same personality traits for their heroes  funny jerks with over confidence or bumbling idiots thrust into power  here the main character is naturally a good person  hes comfortable with being himself and with his best friend  when power comes to him he accepts  he never truly stops being him  he doesn't have to learn a lesson  he just rolls with the punches  almost all of this goes to actor simu liu who brings an extra dose of likability to the role  along with the chemistry he shares with awkwafina which makes their friendship believable  there's even great references  cameos and credit scenes for the fans looking for that  of course there are problems  the biggest is the big cgi slug fest ending that plagues these types of films  when all it truly needed to do was be smaller  it's a mess of cgi at times and feels a little too big and too rushed  characters just instantly know and understand things and accept everything with ease  it is easy to over look all this  with how much fun you'll have ",Positive
515,the actors of this action film did not disappoint! i knew if it had tony chiu wai leung and michelle yeoh it was going to be good! simu liu and awkwafina were fantastic! they kept it traditional but also added a little modern flare to this kung fu movie  must see this movie in the theatre and not sitting on your couch!,Positive
516,"through this movie it looks like marvel is trying to create a new breed and a new universe  this is a post apocalyptic world where thanos's snap has already worked (there are few easter eggs there if you want to find out)  shang chi needs to fight with his own to save his world  the prop used are the rings  pleasantly surprised that marvel is finally trying to bring the inclusion in superheroes through ""captain marvel"" ""black panther"" and now ""shang chi"" marvel fans will definitely watch whatever i review so review is worthless   despite of that i gave a try and yes how many times did you think about kims convenience while watching this movie? ;)",Positive
517,this movie is one of the best in the mcu  the story  the characters  the comedy  and especially the action was exceptional  the choreography was stunning and fresh  the characters are relatable and understandable  the mandarin is one of the best villains in the entire mcu  the mythological aspect was a nice addition to the film  which i personally liked quite a bit  it had everything a superhero film needs  overall  not too much to complain ,Positive
518,it looks like a modernized version of some big budget jackie chan movie  and with the accompanying elements of the wuxia genre  even the main character was given the features of the familiar image of the famous chinese   the same modest  good natured simpleton  skillfully owning martial arts  the film certainly makes an impression  mainly due to those mechanisms that work well for marvel   these are action scenes that are masterfully done here and a light tone of narration with pleasant humor  in a word  the attraction is really entertaining  also with oriental flavor  lush colors of beautiful landscapes  subtle rhythm of battles  but what fails   an entertaining story  compelling dramaturgy  family drama   at least it does not focus on itself in a negative way  rather  it is perceived simply as a typical basis on which the more successful aspects of a work of art shine ,Positive
519,it's exciting that an asian hero is now part of the mcu  it has the right moves  that typical kung fu fight scenes just like any hongkong movie does  but men  that story is so lazy  so typical  it's like marvel got so lazy they think we'll eat up anything  they should have named this 'the mandarin's grief'  a huge disappointment to me  contrary to popular opinions ,Negative
520,"movie has a lot of stuff to keep you hooked 1  vfx  whole movie is visually stunning
2  stunt choreography is awesome  probably the best in mcu so far imo 3  background score  i felt goosebumps everytime the main theme kicks in  soundtrack is good too 4  decent acting except the one who played shang chi's father who had a menacing screen presencedespite of the perfectly blended chinese culture and the mcu's successful (so far) action formula  this movie isn't free from cliche moments  i just wished the second half was less predictable and had something more to offer ",Positive
521,they definitely went all out with it     freaking beautiful ,Positive
522,lot of mcu movies are visual feast but this movie is just on whole another level they explored and mastered almost every aspect of superhero trait only thing they left was kung fu this movie fills that void with added asian tinge lot of credit to casting director with so many speculations on post credit scene this character can be used in any mainstream mcu movie it has everything mcu movie has comedy  breathtaking action sequences  music  screenplay  that father element this movie also has that one thing which majority of mcu movies lack like a good storyline definitely end game isn't end of mcu ,Positive
523,i had a good time watching the movie  i thought it was a little slow at times and that created some pacing issues for me but it wasnt anything to bad  i thought there were some things they could've done better but overall the movie was enjoyable to watch ,Positive
524,"it's very typical marvel      zero surprises in storylines or characters  it's becoming sooooo repetitive in every single ""avengers"" movie this film was different in one aspect though     over 80% of all dialog is subtitled  it's as if it were a chinese film that was released in the u  s   seriously  most of the dialog is in mandarin (or cantonese i can't tell the difference)  this made this unbearable because there was no story to follow if you didn't ""read along""  but the good thing is you really didn't have to read anything to get the story   as posted  it's not original   it's the same as pretty much every other avengers origin story it's long stretches of subtitled dialog broken up with  well  more dance sequences than fighting why 4 stars   production was good  as expected  otherwise a 2 star effort  i mean  i could go read the comics if everything is going to be subtitled ",Positive
525,"the narrator  in one breath  claims the story has been told for thousands of years  in the next breath  she claims this mystery man sought power for a thousand years as the year ""1996"" appears on the screen  so my question is  how many thousands of years has it been since 1996?i know it seems like such a minor thing  after all  this is a marvel fantasy  but to introduce the story in such a sloppy way? no  you already lost me in the first five minutes  i'm tired of flashy movies that forget they need to make sense at least within the confines of their own universe  flash only holds my attention for a few seconds  that alone isn't enough to keep me watching for two hours jeers  marvel  do better ",Negative
526,"after marvel phrase 3  i expected better story  i don't understand how this movie is relevant to marvel superhero  if you have an intellectual property that doesn't mean to promote and marketing of the movie you would say it comes under superhero universe marvel can't make a stand alone movie any more  it has to be forcefully part of other movies coming to shang chi and the ten rings movie was some how watchable  but there is no depth or back story with other supporting characters  and also few things just happens because it's magical movie  there is no relevance or needed  awkwafina was there just for gags and comedy relief but there is not a single character growth or back story to her character  but she was better than simu liu who played shang chi  he felt like he don't want to be in this movie  there was no comfortable performance from him only 2 actors shines in the movie are tony leung and michelle yeoh 1st time antagonist character motivation felt more understandable than protagonists character you will like antagonist character because there was a depth to his story  there is an emotion is linked other characters you won't give a damn  especially shang chi's sister mediocre dialogues
boring story sometimes
cgi was too much cartoonish
characters behaviour won't change from beginning till the end  there won't be any consequences after such big action (bus sequence  and car drifting)  seriously no one asks!!!!",Positive
527,i'll be brief clearly much effort  thought and funding has gone into this flick but it only goes to show that one can assemble all the right ingredients in a recipe and still make a meal of it it has good action  but the live action cg is stale and the transitions always evident it has a solid storyline  but the padding is average it has good actors  but in support roles only in a movie where you know the hero will ultimately triumph  it's all about how you get there this journey was underwhelming ,Positive
528,touch of the mystic in its story and direction  visuals and fight scenes are great and the main characters are extremely likeable  it even has a villain which you can understand ,Positive
529,"i saw chang chi today  and from the reactions i expected something much better  don't get me wrong  i had fun with the movie in general  but possibly i won't see it again anytime soon i liked the fight choreography  tony leung was fantastic  awkwafina was really funny and charming  but simu liu was kind of serviceable  the story could have had more impact  but i think it was sabotaged a little bit by the levity of the marvel formula the direction and photography are great  especially in the macau scenes  but ta lo's magical setting didn't work for me a lot of people will definitely love this movie  and i understand why  but something didn't click    
as a matter of personal taste  i think i liked black widow more than this movie  and i didn't love that movie either it's a reasonably fun movie for sunday afternoons  but in the end i was glad it was over ",Positive
530,visually beautiful good action sequences  great starcast but what ruined my experience was the over expectations  i went for this one after reading it's extremely positive reviews all around just like the suicide squad (even that was one was an average flick nothing else) but later turned out to be an average movie   neither bad nor too good   ,Positive
531,"marvel does a lot right  and a good fight scene is one of them  but this movie had battles and characters that are only available in the context of this new world and this story  despite a ""classic"" and somewhat cliche story it brought me a lot of joy  classics are classic for a reason right? cliches are powerful in the right light  also the post credit scenes! yes! marvelllllll you did it again ",Positive
532,the story of the film is a very good and powerful adventure story that has a very good narrative process  the breathtaking start of the film nails the viewer to the foot of the film  the film has the utmost excitement and charm  which at the height of the excitement is balanced with a very funny comedy  and this comedy keeps the viewer happy from the beginning to the end of the film  the atmosphere of the film is narrated in a very lovable fantasy world  which creates a beautiful world for the viewer by using eye catching images and using the strange creatures that are inside it  in general  the film has a deep story and a lot of excitement and charm  and with its mythical battles and artistic special effects  it gives the viewer the best feelings and ultimate pleasure ,Positive
533,the first marvel film with a mandarin feel  the beginning of the film feels like a chinese colossal classic when xu wenwu meets li  fighting scenes are interesting and fun by combining asian and western style fights  the plot of the story is also classic but the audience actually feels sympathy for wenwu  the appearance of the dragon and the fighting scene of the dragon adds to the asian impression in this film  you could say this is an asian flavored marvel film  for actors  tony leung's acting is undoubtedly a colossal action senior ,Positive
534,average protagonists  average villains  average world building  speaking of the villain i loved how he left his son to drown then proceeded to save him from the monster painfully generic and black panther is better ,Positive

536,this is a fun movie  it has the kind of feel to it which made marvel movie a must see  it's quirky  it's fast  story is half flashback and half in the present  it has recall to some of the oldest marvel movies  like hulk 2 and the abomination! wong is pretty awesome in this movie  all in all a must watch for marvel fans alike ,Positive
537,"i delayed watching this for a long time  thinking it would be some cheesy  hollywood ""chop suey"" fiasco     but     wow  was i mistaken!i should have known better  seeing that tony leung and michelle yeoh have starring roles i'm finding it hard to remember a marvel movie better than this  maybe that's a pointless exercise  since they're all very different (mostly) whatever  this is well worth watching  the cgi is some of the best i've seen  and it actually blends pretty well with the live action (not always the case with other movies)  the fight scenes are beautifully choreographed  in the hong kong style (with a nod to jackie chan in the first half)  the creature battle at the end is a masterpiece of visual effects the character development is fairly standard (father/son)  but done do well it doesn't really matter  simu liu and awkwafina are perfectly cast  and bring a well balanced comedic touch overall really very impressed  my faith in marvel has been (partially) restored ",Positive
538,'shang chi and the legend of the ten rings' is the latest instalment of the marvel cinematic universe  starring mcu newcomers simu liu as the titular character and tony leung as 'wenwu' and  at last  the definitive portrayal of 'the mandarin'  helmed by director destin daniel cretton this picture injects the perfect amount of asian culture into this enormous franchise the cast is stellar  especially liu who wished this role into existence years ago on social media and i couldn't imagine anyone else in the role  he has brilliant on screen chemistry with co star awkwafina who plays 'katy'  shang chi's best friend  katy acts as the audiences lens into this world  she is just a normal person and i feel her role is pivotal in helping general audiences digest a story with this many magical elements  thanks to leung's performance 'wenwu' has become one of the best mcu villains  he is the excellent blend of menacing and sympathetic with understandable motives the fight choreography is second to none in the mcu  they linked perfectly with the set pieces created for this film  they were excellent  in particular the bus fight scene and the final fight between wenwu and shang chi  these brilliant pieces of action were achieved through the lack of camera cuts and smooth camera movements to exhibit the skilled choreography  along with the set pieces  the overall look of this film is stunning  there are some especially beautiful shots within the final fight scene which makes up for some of the routine marvel tropes which this picture eventually falls into the main themes of family and grief are incredibly heartfelt  they're told expertly through these characters and are deeply rooted in asian culture  something this film showcases with perfection  from the ten rings compound to the golden daggers club in macau to the fictional land of ta lo  the asian culture is always on show and this film  along with the wider mcu  benefits from it tenfold however  this film is not as perfect as it could've been  thanks in large part to the marvel formula which this picture falls into like many of it's predecessors  this is most apparent in the 3rd act which not only drags on for too long  but also turns into big cgi monster vs big cgi monster once again  when i believe a more grounded martial arts style fight would've been more fitting overall  'shang chi' began as a breath of fresh air into this franchise  with deeply rooted themes  a gargantuan cast and stunning fight choreography until it gave in to the ordinary marvel formula which has plagued this genre since it's inception  despite this  the future looks bright for these characters and the post credit scene cements the titular character as an mcu mainstay for years to come 8 5/10 ,Positive
539,"shang chi is definitely not marvel's best film as with most marvel orgin stories but should be a welcome and very likeable character in the mcuthe good the action was amazing and beautiful choreography

540,first hour was passable  some good humour  some good action sequences  second hour was interminable  tons of confusing cheap an overblown predictable climax  the lead actor was bland and utterly forgettable  his sidekick and sister were much more interesting  terrible disney bloodless crap overall ,Positive
541,"personally i do not care what race any superhero is since it is irrelevant  this movie was quite impressive with the vfx but some of the humour was a bit too childish and seemed out of place  seems like the humour was for a lower age group than the intended age targets watching the movie  i would have preferred this was more adult than kiddie  i can't complain about the acting or the story  they seemed adequate for me in this movie and easily overlooked from the visuals i was more interested in  considering the movie is based on magical superheroes the obvious flaws in logic don't apply and the mistakes are easily overlooked  i enjoyed this one enough to add it my collection and won't hesitate to watch again  definitely was worth the watch this movie is fill wth lot's of word's of wisdom  here's some for people before they start jumping on soapboxes about races of characters in movies or pointing their fingers in any direction;
1   racists come in all colours  shapes and sizes  the only thing that matters is we are all part of the human race and bleed the same colour!2   if people ever want to truly end racism then don't be hypocrites and start with your own backyards including yourselves  family  friends and associates ",Positive
542,i really enjoyed the vfx in the movie  fight scenes were not very believable from the leads  the acting as others mentioned wasn't that great either  the lame jokes were for little kids that wouldn't even be old enough to watch this  too bad they couldn't decide what the target audience was and make it more adult like it should have been  well worth watching and still a keeper for the visuals but better off turning off the audio for it ,Positive
543,"6 for purely martial arts entertainment there are dozens of china produced/financed martial arts/fantasy films where laws of physics agnostic fight scenes are as implausible as the speeded up movements  however  most are either based on some ancient fable or setting  or in a police/crime drama where chinese cities appear more modern than anything in north america probably also financed by china based interests  this is a disneyfied take on the bread and butter of chinese martial arts films  the plot to draw in us audiences is to have the two young protagonists played by 1st generation n  americans  including the off the wall akwafina with her mouthy repartees and gravely vocal delivery apart from that  it is not particularly distinctive  with the major ""star"" casting of michelle yeoh who is well known to us audiences for decades  first as a bond ""girl""  then in crouching tiger hidden dragon  star trek discovery series  and in filthy rich asians  as a malaysian  she is illiterate in any chinese language  and learns her lines phonetically!the lead  an unknown canadian  is competent and awkwafina does her part to make the film ""relatable"" to the social media generation  good cgi and opulent sets don't compensate for an otherwise ""run of the mill"" martial arts production                   5/10 social significance for us audiences as for social comment  it is high time that entertainment media fully represent the demographic reality of the us  where 6 percent of americans are of asian origin  but both actors and storylines are almost invisible  only as secondary characters to a white or jewish protagonist if they are asian american  or only able to seek pigeonholing roles of an immigrant  shopkeeper  criminal gangster  or taciturn eastern guru   all of whom speak english with a demented cookie voice this movie does nothing to address the basic lack of visible integration of asian americans into the fabric of portrayals of tv or film  i can think only of 911  and of the former reboot of charlie's angels where the asian origin of characters was neither highlighted nor subjugated apart from that  the multiplication of mono ethnocentric productions (on ""black"" cable networks) still does not address the lack of portrayal of non whites in an integrated fashion   but a form of apartheid in mass media ",Positive
544,great start  especially the fight choreography between shang chi's parents  that was sheer awesome and so was the fight in bus where we got good humour as a bonus but then story gets dragged out and turns weird instead of taking us to shang chi's universe which is about martial arts    we are to dr  strange's dark door  a soul consuming monster from another realm    it was like they borrowed elements just for the hell of it expected so much   ,Positive
545,fantastic cgi & good fight scenes but that where it ends acting is weak and sometimes annoying  story not catchy and some characters don't have anything to add suffering like many other movies: weak story ,Negative
546,couple of things  1  the actors are made of plastic  i know it wasn't a cgi cartoon but the actors were so one dimensional it may as well have been  have never seen live actors display the uncanny valley  2  feels alot more like a disney film and less like a marvel super hero movie  3  it was super formulaic  awkwafina was as usually not funny and every little chuckle was super forced  overall had some good fight choreography but you can get that in any other kung fu movie  kind of makes you wonder why so much money was spent on a very very very template movie  kind of lame ,Positive
547,i did not expect this one to be that good  honestly one of the best mcu solo films  definitely blows black widow out of the water  aquafina is pretty likeable in everything she does  good for her  only letdown was simu liu  no presence  no charisma no acting chops  just imagine the same movie  a tiny bit more serious with andrew koji as shang chi and jackie chan as the mandarin  i would pay to see that!,Positive
548,one of the best marvel movies i've ever seen  was not expecting for it to be this good but it exceeded expectations far and beyond  definitely recommend this!,Positive
549,"that was a freakin' blast! the story is complex and interesting it fills some gaps in the mcu and simultaneously is a great origin story for the character of shang chi the whole cast is amazing  i mean there is so much chemistry between them  simu liu and tony leung are phenomenal in their respective roles  the mandarin tho   so well created character the movie is amazing bridge between east and west culture  there is so much to explore  much like wakanda  the history of shang's culture is so rich the fight choreography is absolute kick in the gutts   in a good way  i mean this is something completely new for the mcu and they deliver it again! everything looks so goddamn good and i can't help myself thinking about some scenes! also  the colors  the effects  the camera work and etc  everything is magnificent there is humor for sure  but there is also emotional impact  this is not some bland action packed movie  it's made with heart from fans for the fans  kudos to the director destin cretton!killer soundtrack and the main song for the movie ""run it"" fits so good with all there are a few surprises  that were hidden from the promos and trailers and man   just wait to see them about the credit scenes   they are two  both are good  but one of them is   sick!for sure deserves more than one viewing in the cinema  so much story building  details  action  fun  the people who underestimated this movie will be so surprised how great is it ",Positive
550,great action sequences and visual effects throughout  likeable characters  especially tony leung as wenwu  definitely one of the best mcu villains  absolutely great action and choreography  best hand to hand combat scenes in the mcu after the winter soldier  however the movie just went downhill after the first half of the movie  definitely could have been much better  should have been better ,Positive
551,"everything about this movie is great i loved it so much the cgi towards the end was lacking but that's not a surprise that they would do that to this asian led film they did it with black panther as well
the fight scenes are fantastic i loved every one of them  all around damn good movie ",Positive
552,"another same shi    clishee super hero movie
plzzzzzz stop making this shi    holywood is dead
repeat
holywood is dead
their ideas finishedim done with hollywood movies i pref watch other countries movies
they better
like korean ",Positive
553,it was refreshing to see this new mcu movie  i thought it didn't feel like a typical mcu movie and i loved it for that the character of shang chi was a relatable well developed character and his relationship with awkwafina was pleasently good and didn't feel forced in any way she is mostly used as a comedic source in this movie but she had a nice balance where i didn't feel like she was too annoying like marvel tends to make certain characters fighting choreography was unbelievable and i enjoyed it a lot  it certainly brought something fresh to the mcu  the villain was very memorable and had a nice little arch throught the movie there are however certain flaws in this movie that didn't quite land with me ben kingsley   even though an incredible actor was unecessery in this movie  he was used just as a comedic energy that never worked in my eyes  it was incredibly annoying and didn't bring any charm to this movie so some moments were ruined by the classical marvel comedy the movie overall felt like it was grounded and simplistic and i loved it for that   we don't need avengers style in every single marvel movie and that is exactly what this movie does in the third act the thrid act in my opinion just forgets the whole buildup   the fighting choreography   the art of chinese martial arts and gets into full speed marvel mode you get this big sci fi battle with flying monsters   lightshow   flying people and everything that was kind of lowkey in the first two acts was turned into red bull energy drink in the third act  why is every single hero fighting to save the whole world !? i think we need at least 200 more avengers because the marvel earth is apperently unsafest planet in existence one big question for me is   if ten rings is such a threat to our world and they have been doing bad things for years how come no one noticed that ? did avengers never hear about them ? wong ?there are plenty of questions unanswered but i still enjoyed this movie  it felt like it gave respect to some older martial art movies and for some time it definitely had that special charm if they had only kept it more simplistic and consistent throughout the whole movie   this one could have been much better platinummanyt 7 4/10 ,Positive
554,"shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is being called ""the asian black panther "" and i think this is an inaccurate description for two reasons  first  asian cultures have been explored in depth by hollywood since the 1970s at the latest  and in ways that sub saharan african cultures have not  but second  and more to the point  shang chi is really just a mashup of two hollywood subgenres that have been around for quite some time: the ""ethnic discovery"" film and the ""stupid american tourist"" film the ""ethnic discovery"" film is the more recent type and by far the more interesting  ultimately inspired by alex haley's famous tv miniseries ""roots "" it documents the saga of a protagonist who learns   or relearns   about his or her heritage and embarks on a quest to fully embrace that heritage  a good example i can think of is thunderheart  in which an fbi agent (val kilmer) comes to appreciate his father's native american ancestry while on a case on a lakota reservation; a more famous but fantasy based example is star wars  in which luke skywalker learns that he has jedi blood  on the surface  shang chi definitely follows this pattern unfortunately  the movie's ""ethnic discovery"" theme is undercut by the clichés of an even older hollywood storyline: what one film historian has dubbed the ""racial adventure film "" but which i simply call the ""stupid american tourist film "" common since the 1930s  this film plot follows western (and almost always white) characters as they visit an ""exotic"" foreign land   often for purely exploitative purposes   and proceed to reveal their ignorance about the ""native"" culture  it has always been demeaning to both the ""colonizing"" and indigenous peoples  since the former are forced to make buffoons of themselves and the latter must bear the humiliation of not being taken seriously shang chi is an ""ethnic rediscovery"" film in that two chinese americans from san francisco learn (and  in one case  relearn) about the culture of their ancestors; but it is also a racial adventure film in that they are essentially westerners who travel to china and find themselves in the midst of a culture clash  while not white   and  in the case of the titular character  an immigrant   shang chi and his girlfriend otherwise fit the role of the ""stupid american tourist"" with their unmistakably american accents  annoying use of slang  pointless pop culture references  and wisecracking sarcasm  the twist here is that  like kilmer in thunderheart  they revert to their ""noble savage"" origins once they have traveled to an ""ethnic"" place and ""gone native ""not incidentally  there's one more way in which shang chi and the legend of the ten rings differs dramatically from black panther  while both are based on ""non western"" comic book sagas created by white men  black panther turns stereotypes about black africans completely inside out  giving us fantastic science fiction instead of hackneyed ""jungle"" adventure  but shang chi is just the usual ""kung pow"" hash about the orient  presented ironically but also in a way that isn't terribly original in fact  if there's another marvel movie this one closely resembles  it's not black panther but deadpool  both combine wacky humor and serious (and even ""dark"") subject matter in a way that's very jarring and ultimately exasperating  but at least deadpool felt fresh ",Positive
555,i found this very slow moving and boring special effects are silly looking drags on  ends  tells you this is the start of a whole new marvel strand  oh dear ,Negative
556,just flat and somewhat boring  felt more like a dc tv show then a marvel film entertaining but just falls down as a marvel film so many hero's in the marvel universe why pick this one?!,Positive
557,"for me to not give a marvel movie a 10/10 is not heard of (by me)  which is what happened with black widow  which i have an 8/10 (low for a marvel movie  for me)  well  i'm glad to say that with ""shang chi   the legend of the ten rings"" marvel are back in top form  not only is the movie excellent   opening up a great story with wonderful  engaging characters  and great new locations   but something i don't always think when i think ""marvel movies"" is that there are many scenes in which i just thought to myself that they made a beautiful movie  too  it's really too bad that this movie didn't get the chance other marvel movies got with a non pandemic times movie theater release  it would've surely broken the 1 billion dollar mark  very recommended ",Positive
558,shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is the first marvel film of phase 4 worth seeing espically when compared to the extremely generic black widow movie that came out earlier this year  the pros of the film are definitely it's action sequences and beautiful cinematography  the cons of this movie for me were the humor and the films predictability  but the pros of this film definitely outweigh it's cons ,Positive
559,i didn't watch this movie when it comes first as because i didn't think that it's worth to watch but yesterday i took a time and watched it  and man i've to say it's amazing movies guys  excellent cinematography  direction  and acting of the cast  i love the simu liu and fala chen  they're amazing  highly recommended even if you're not marvel fan   ,Positive
560,shang chi is probably in the top 3 most action packed mcu movies  the choreography was mind blowing like their were so many wtf moments in the choreography that blew me away  the visuals are probably some of the best in the mcu by far becaus ethey were just so extrodinary as well as the amazing cinematography  the story was good but i feel like it could of had been better but overall i really liked this movie and i definitley reccomend people to give it ago ,Positive
561,"with ""endgame""  the mcu had its well deserved success in 2019  but how should it continue after that? it was clear that kevin feige did not want to quit  of course  but unfortunately i have to say that no film or show after the ""avengers"" spectacle has really convinced me so far  that's why i was hoping for ""shang chi"" (2021)  which should score points above all with spectacular action scenes (inspired by asian cinema)  but after watching the movie  i'm unfortunately anything but enthusiastic  ""shang chi"" has great action here and there  but what about the rest?shaun and his best friend katy are searching for a meaning in their life when suddenly shaun's father  a powerful mafia boss with magical rings in his possession  visits his son  the reason is that shaun was trained to be a killer  but wanted a different life  sadly his father cannot accept that    i'll have to spoil small details  but in my opinion ""shang chi"" is not a film that can really be spoiled because it is made like almost every other typical superhero film first  let's get to the action  which has received so much critical acclaim  yes  the choreographies are really impressive and beautiful to look at in the first two thirds  this is something that a lot of mcu movies don't do well  which is why i really appreciate the action here too  but when the finale is approaching  the action quickly subsides  because here it unfortunately needed a big cgi battle festival with big creatures and apocalyptic events  this is exactly what was already dealt with critically in ""civil war""  but marvel keeps falling into this old superhero cliché  for the ""avengers"" films  that decision is perfectly fine (especially for ""infinity war"" and ""endgame"")  but what about the stand alone films? here you have to keep asking yourself: where are the other avengers? where is spider man  doctor strange or captain marvel?""shang chi"" would have worked so much better if the finale had been a personal battle between shaun and his dad  instead  you need gigantic demons and cgi battles  even the green screen work is not always good in my opinion and quickly looks artificial and fake  no matter what you think about the ""matrix"" sequels  but the fight scenes there are so much more impressive to me because you often only used cgi when you needed it  or let's watch asian martial arts films with bruce lee or jackie chan  there was hardly ever any computer trickery because most of these films were shot between the 60s and 80s  at the moment you can rather watch the ""john wick"" films if you want to see spectacular and hand made action  because ""shang chi"" unfortunately has little to offer apart from the action    the story is the absolute run of the mill cliché stuff  which is now rather parodied in many of these films  the classic outsider who has problems with his father and still has to learn a lot about himself  but is already so good that he could do it on his own easily  his girlfriend katy is the necessary sidekick and knocks out the obvious jokes so that the viewer does not get too lost in the drama  everything is so forced and unnatural that i was bored to death  and marvel films in particular are supposed to be fun and entertaining  ""shang chi"" wants to repeat the ""black panther"" success and shows a superhero who is not white  but in this case of asian origin  and that's great and important  but in the end we mustn't forget that a film cannot be judged solely on the basis of its intentions  even ""black panther"" was only average for many fans in the end  but it could offer a bit more interesting story elements for me the mcu is currently suffering from a trivial ""mass taste"" identity  everything that came after ""endgame"" can be described in one word: safe  ""shang chi"" is also designed in such a way that as many people as possible can enjoy the film  it wants to be dark and ""cool""  but at the same time also child friendly and funny another problem are the way too perfect protagonists of these new mcu works  they can often solve all of their problems within one film  at the end of the movie  for example  shang chi has practically nothing that he can improve on  tony stark or peter parker had to fight and work on themselves in every film and often did not reach their goal by the end of the film  but that makes characters more exciting in many ways  in my opinion  the characters in ""shang chi"" are too superficial with their problems  it may all be heartbreaking and violent on paper  but the execution doesn't seem anything but real  it's a typical movie that feels like a typical movie and sounds like a typical movie the actors may not be the reason for all of this  but i didn't find any of the acting performances really convincing or interesting  yes  lead actor simu liu is physically capable of doing these great stunts himself and i really appreciate that  but there has to be more when it comes to acting as well  and that applies to everyone in the cast  except maybe tony leung chiu wai  who plays shaun's father  he does his job very well  after all he´s in the business for quite a while now  there's also a surprise guest from a previous marvel movie (i won't name him or her separately)  but i've rarely seen such a pointless character in a movie  this character is only there so that marvel and kevin feige can say  ""here's our fan service  baby!""director destin daniel cretton  who has already made a name for himself in the film business  certainly had the best intentions  as did his talented cameraman bill pope (who has already worked for the ""matrix"" sequels or sam raimi's ""spider man"" films)  but in the end marvel and disney seem to have too much say and want their product to be suitable for the masses  and if you're not a scorsese or a nolan  then it's not so easy to get your vision through one last word to the composer joel p west  who wrote a (sometimes) beautiful score with asian influences  in the action  however  the whole thing quickly seems very unimaginative    conclusion: ""shang chi"" has finally shown me that marvel is slowly becoming trivial  it was almost clear that after ""endgame"" practically nothing could really astonish us anymore  but there was still hope with me  but precisely this hope is crumbling right now  great action alone is not enough for a film to convince me and ""shng chi"" is the best proof ",Positive
562,one of those films you feel they spent lots of money on except for the writing  if crouching tiger hidden dragon is a ming vase  this is a red plastic cup  has all the superficial concept of being 'chinese' without any subtelty  basically a story for kids with nothing original  shame cos the actors were good and it was almost but not quite a fun film  i could have written a better story when i was 10 years old  anyway  kids will love it  adults probably just be happy that their kids are quiet for the duration  i guess it fits into the superhero mold of films that are all coming out now  but i'm finding these increasingly 2 dimensional and shallow  is it worth watching  no  unless you are 10 yrs old ,Positive
563,"for starters  the cinematography and the cgi are pretty nice  however that's where the positive ends the fighting choreography is ok  not bad but not great at all  for example even mortal combat did it way better with way less  also it follows the usual marvel formula of a lot of cgi in the fighting scenes  but this time they blew of the roof with it making those scenes feel completely detached from the world they're in concerning the characters  shang chi isn't really there for most parts of the movie  taking a few steps back in his very own movie  a lot of things that other characters did in their time in the spotlight should have been done by him  there was no reason for him to not do those things  causing him to be a neglected in his own movie  basically a background character  as for the female leads  one is just plain annoying and really serves no purpose(you'll know instantly when she appears)  the other is an over the top strong woman actually getting most of the screentime  which don't get me wrong the actress acts nicely  but the way she is presented in the story and the way her character has come to be and is established is just unnatural and feels like she's just someone who has activated irl cheats  it just feels like they took a real shortcut with her character whilst there was so much they could've done to make her really likeable and immersable for you as a viewer  however the way they handled her just makes her feel like a 2d cardboard character that used cheats to max her stats as for the story and dialogue  the story is just abyssmal  really lacking in content and feels like something a hungover student would drum up last minute after a late night party  the dialogue feels wooden most of the time  just really unnatural and don't even get me started on the ""humor"" which is overly forced and just really bad it feels like a movie that knows what it wants to do  but not how it wants to do that and just goes at it in a dozen ways leaving to much clutter and sidesteps for it to feel like a coherent story  if only they had chosen 1 or 2 things and stuck with them it could have been a decent flick ",Positive
564,wow  that was an incredible experience watching this film!it's a masterpiece of imagination and martial arts plus incredibly deep emotional element! in addition to that the humour there makes you laugh out loud!i experienced a wide range of emotions! it's honestly right on the top of all films with imagination  utterly fantastic!!!,Positive
565,some people hate katy  but i think she's the only one that brings you to laugh  and without her  that movie would be boring  sorry  not sorry it's so the beginning is lame until the first action scene  and with a bit lameness between  it's a good movie the end there come the good against the evil of course  but  with a hint of star wars(?),Negative
566,forget it boys  china is more interested in its own movie industry than yours  all you're doing is making yourselves look foolish  like john cena's grovelling apology anyhoo  this movies okay for a superhero movie  perfectly suitable for the braindead who don't like real movies  backstory  some talking  big action scene  wash  rinse  repeat ,Positive
567,i'm a bit late to this review as i waited for the disney channel release rather than go to the cinema i'm very happy with my choice! if i'd spent money going to see this i would have been even more disappointed than i already am by far the weakest mcu film to date in almost every way  the story was at best okay  the jokes missed the mark more often than not  the fight scenes were messy and childish looking and the effects weee probably the worst i've seen in the universe  cartoony and like a bad video game the main cast were too old for the characters they were portraying  watching it felt like people in their 30s playing people in their 20 who acted like 15 year oldsi really hope these characters get left behind during phase 4 to be honest  mcu made a massive casting mistake and because of it i can't see how it can be reframed for them to come into the wider spectrum unless through the multiverse new actors can come in as bad to the mcu as iron fist was to netflix ,Positive
568,"good:

(some) good dialogue

569,the trailer for this movie made me think it was going to be ok  but when i finally sat down to watch it    omgggggg this movie was so good  the storyline from beginning to end was very fluid and it included everything so that you won't be lost during the movie  the fight scenes get a 10 out of 10 from me and if this movie becomes a video game  i will be first in line to buy it  the graphics were phenomenal  and i liked how they stayed true to the asian culture throughout the movie  i will watch this movie again!,Positive
570,"this probably the first marvel film with asian leading actor (shiang chi) that i know of   well apart from wong & ted the casting managed to captive our attention and pretty much with action package however the only makes me not really happy is that the cgi for the battle against the ""thing"" is way look like a computer games characters cgi  such a lousy editing apart from that   shiang chi is worth your attention  cant wait for shiang chi join the avengers ",Positive
571,"a fantastic marvel movie definitely know one of my top favorite marvel movie
amazing action and story with amazing actors was blown away by this  how movie ended up ",Positive
572,the best thing about this movie is that the filmmakers really understood what makes kung fu action movies so good  the way their shot and edited  with longer takes  few cuts and wider angles  so that we can completely take in and appreciate the action is it takes place i didn't give this a 10  just because some of the cgi is very obvious and fake  otherwise  it's a good story  that's well told  with excellent cinematography and fight choreography  what else can you ask for from a kung fu movie?,Positive
573,the story is quite bland  and through all of it there is a feeling i've already watched the movie a long time ago  the main character and his companions make no decisions of their whatsoever  but just do what they are told to by the support actors it's fine to watch as a no brain fighting movie  but that's it  just as much one could watch a jackie chan movie  albeit without modern cgi ,Positive
574,marvel recruits indie director destin daniel cretton of short term 12 fame to bring the character of shang chi to the marvel cinematic universe sadly  an abundance of familiar tropes  messy visual effects and a lead character who is overshadowed both by performance and development from the villain leads to a painfully average film shang chi follows all the needed and formal tropes to make a surprisingly dull origin tale  simu liu is fine in the role of shang chi who must challenge his father from unleashing a terrible foe tony leung makes his english language debut as wenwu  a far more compelling and intriguing character then his son  with leung giving a refreshingly subtle performance awkwafina is fine as shang chi's friend katy but her generic arc lets her down  meng'er zhang plays shang chi's sister  xialing who is also far more interesting then her titular brother but lacks the screentime to really be fleshed out the ensemble do solid work with notable standouts being michelle yeoh  fala chen with a very funny ben kingsley and a much welcomed benedict wong the film soars during the rather intimate scenes between wenwu and his wife leiko but these scenes are soon traded for large scale battles with ugly green screen backgrounds aside from some intriguing post credits scenes  the film leaves you wanting more  it's a shame that marvel didn't allow cretton to make use of his indie sensibilities and resigned him to a basic origin tale that is painfully average ,Positive
575,"absolutely loved it  must watch  non stop action and all you can imagine in a good movie    
i am not saying any more  just watch the film and you will not be disappointed i think i will go to the cinema at least one more time to watch it again  that how great it was i am simply buzzing!!!",Positive
576,i was very impressed with the narrative of this film  not predictable at all  amazing fight choreography  sometimes the action sequences were blurry  which was my only complaint  great cast  color grade was pretty good too ,Positive
577,the same old stuff we've seen so many times before in marvel movies  generic plot lines  characters acting like no actual person would ever do this one has a criminally underused asian girl side kick  and nice special effects  that's about it  nothing makes it memorable  its basically another second tier  forgettable marvel movie ,Positive
578,the movie is more like an action movie than a superhero one the action are visual treat for audience but the storyline is not however  considering the character introduction  it is still a good movie to watch but certainly not the best mcu character introduction some animation scenes are really beautiful and the eastern mythology is always an inspiration ,Positive
579,there is no story here  just mindless martial arts gelled with computer graphics  and the movie has some scenes that reminded me of avatar  anyhow  avatar was great  this is not  it is one of the worst marvel movies  i can go back to rewatching thor ragnorok or endgame and still enjoy them  but not this one ,Positive
580,"overall  the movie was worth a watch  a lot of pretty scenery and great fight scenes  it is just getting ridiculous how the directors and production companies are not caring about the movie quality anymore  as long as they get their messages out  you can tell the director and writer have never picked up a marvel comic  they way they try to make you see that this movie is tied into the marvel universe is ludicrous  i see the writers all sitting around someone who got themselves in the group because daddy works at a higher level  no experience whatsoever ""let's see  i have an idea  ok hear me out  wong  wong is asian so lets make sure he makes an appearance  that makes great sense to me  now what reason would wong have to fight in a place you wouldn't find anyone as honorable as he is  to be hanging out  ok  let's don't explain that people will just get it because he is asian  right? ok now who would he fight in the ""look here i am to connect this movie to us"" scene? oh  i got it  abomination  ya that makes total sense to me  i mean  wong was just minding his business one day  and abomination stopped by because he was in the area and wanted to know if he wanted to go fishing  wong said sure  let me open up a portal to the lake and we will go  oh  my  my portal got messed up  how did we get to an illegal fight club in china? ok  i guess while we are here  we will sign up to fight each other  since i just forgot how to open my portals  (oh no!) fight  fight  fight  ok abomination i am going to make you punch yourself  hands through the portal  my favorite trick  works all of the time  ouch  wong  that hurt  oh but guess what abomination  when you took that hit  it woke me up to remember how to open my portals again  let's go home  shall we  ok wong  let's go that is it  it would rival the greats  i am a genius no you are an idiot  actually  you may just have bad taste  the hiring people at marvel are idiots and the people that give final approval  are no better well  we had a good first round of marvel movies for 20 years  the millennium generation is taking over  so it is all downhill from here  dang ",Positive
581,this film is    good     but a little disappointing let's start with the positives  this movie looks incredible  the chinese elements and asian american influences give this film a wonderfully unique style  the fight choreography is some of the cleanest ever seen in the universe  it all looks incredible and clear  with clear lessons learned from the works of bruce lee  simu liu does an amazing job and i adore shang chi and a character  i cannot wait to see more of him in the future unfortunately  the writing really lets this movie down in a lot of ways  none of the characters in the film feel like they learn or grow throughout the story  including shang chi  shang starts out as a trained fighter who loves his dad but condemns his actions and he finishes the film in the exact same spot  i similar thing can be said for his father who also feels very stagnant  shang's sister is unbelievably one dimensional filling in as the badass woman type with no further depth beyond her painful american accent  the comic relief characters very much overstay their welcome and become grating as things go on  this is very apparent for the return of trevor who should have remained nothing more than a 10 second cameo the story itself is very messy and cliche  at the beginning of the film  we are presented with an amulet that is treated as being very important but disappears at the end of the first act  shang's journey isn't really motivated with himself  but through an urge to stop whatever his father is doing  it all feels very hallow i appreciate what this movie will do for asian representation  but am underwhelmed by it simply as a film on its own  not unlike that of black panther ,Positive
582,"awkwafina should not be the most interesting part of your $150 million kung fu movie she wasn't great (sometimes she was a bit annoying  to be honest)  but everyone else was forgettable  shang chi himself was the generic ""slacker with potential"" character with no personality  and he was a live wire compared to the rest of the cast  aside from awkwafina  the others seemed to have picked one emotion (either stoic  angry  stern  or ""wise"") and stuck with it wait a minute  i forgot about ben kingsley  his appearance was a nice surprise (i think)  but he was a wacky disney animated movie sidekick with an awful looking cgi pet monster (who was also a wacky disney animated movie sidekick) shang chi strikes me as an american friendly martial arts movie  not that i'm an expert on kung fu movies  but i've watched enough movies (including several marvel movies) to know a factory made action flick when i see it  the movie is very watered down there was  for instance  no effort involved in developing a plot or telling a story whatsoever  it's almost the exact same plot as the cw's kung fu series  family vs  family i wanted to enjoy the fight scenes (i can tell that a lot of effort was put into them)  but everything looked fake  obvious special effects mixed with artificial movie sets  the final battle was two giant cartoons wrestling each other as a matter of fact  almost every scene in the movie was covered in computer graphics i didn't hate the movie  i can see other people liking it  but i was bored most of the time ",Positive
583,i really enjoyed this one  the story line was quite straight forward  but the movie was less pretentious and had a lot of grace at some point (nods to crouching tiger hidden dragon)  the colour scheme and action scenes were absolutely amazing  great cast  with a funny awkwafina (but please  don't start playing the same type character roles now)  i would say  this is one of my most favourite marvel movies ,Positive
584,"mannnn    this movie is good let me    just say   first of all   omg the fights! the action! oh   my   god  marvel did it again after having a slight setback with the just okay black widow movie  this movie has the best fight scenes i've seen since the raid films  the fights are so well choreographed but also fast paced and filmed to perfection  the bus fight is incredible!!!!! the fight in the beginning between the mandarin and the mother   wow wow wow   
okay back to reality  this movie does have flaws  first of all the pacing in like the 3/4rd of the film is a tat slow  the score honestly is weak  might be my theater but there were moments where the score had to make me feel something and (credits to the movie itself that it let me ) i had to do that all by myself the plot sometimes leans to a pretty basic plot  but because of the great screenplay it works cinematography was amazing  the acting was good  and the special effects were very good  one thing that i have to admit  game of thrones kind of spoiled us with the design of    a particular mythical creature so    that won't look as great as it could've been but still very good but man the fights were incredible   the camera work was so good  fluent movements but fast and i could see everything  after snake eyes i thought i would never see a good martial arts movie again considering how average that was thank you  shang chi  you made my night 9 out of 10  welcome back marvel ",Positive
585,loved the all asian cast  but i understand many people aren't going to like that because of their own insecurities  but aside from that the cgi  storyline  and characters all brought an interesting rendition for each of their own and the post credit scene was also a really cool connector into how shang chi may fit in with his new avenger buddies ,Positive
586,some innovative but non perilous fights sets up a hopefully more complete marvel story thread great to see trevor again a rehash of kung fu panda 3 minus the dumplings ,Positive
587,i thought this movie was long  2 hrs 12 min  felt more like 2 5 3 hrs  i was ok at first but as it went on i got bored and couldn't believe it felt so long  there were other people laughing and enjoying his side kick comedy  it was all too 13 yr  oldish for me  not a bad movie but not a 8 1 tho  5 6  average ,Positive
588,"in the future we need more fantasy open world series in marvel its kinda trending for along time   fans and peoples waiting for something like this   its hype above all movies   
so the myth has been adapted in movies  mystical beings fought face to face   it's been a long time to watch movie like   we did watch chinese fantasy series with low budget dragons & mystical beings   but not like this   we could see proper visual effect arts of the fight   i wish marvel studios could do more beast fighting in fantasy realm with hereos and villains  or limbo like devil may cry kind of    yeah it does looks like dante running above dragon back fighthing his devil father   end up his father saved him and let him inherit the fortunes power of the families   anyway im still waiting devil may cry movie live action   i dont know when the hollywood going to adapt the movie someday   i hope the dream come true for all of us   if you want more profit just do movie like this   peoples like it very much   fantasy all   humans dreams to be like that   but it will happen only in afterlife    i mean for real   you should check your religion books about afterlife  ",Positive
589,"not sure how to review this movie  all i could think about was the other chinese movie ""the great wall""  effects were really good  but the movie was to slow for me ",Positive
590,a movie with clear and crisp visuals that blends chinese kung fu with cgi to perfection  but this seems to come at a cost of a weak and underdeveloped plot with misplaced priorities that prevents the audience from investing into the characters ,Negative
591,all these 10's are suspicious  imdb should really do something about fake or reviews that came from the production crew and their friends and families it's an ok movie  it's the same marvel formula  forced humor but pretty visuals  story is a bit better than recent marvel stuff of late but still the same daddy issues (what's up with that?),Positive
592,visually stimulating from beginning to end  funny  smart  and befitting the marvel canon!! excellent film that's fun for the whole family! a true must see!!!,Positive
593,what a breath of fresh air this film is  it's doesn't feel like your traditional marvel film till the end scene  mid and end credit scene visually beautiful the creatures and scenery  the action was fast paced and blows you away can't fault this film  you walk out the cinema and could easily walk back in and watch it again ,Positive
594,shang chi is one of those movies that starts off strong and never stops entertaining you  from the beginning  i felt connected to the characters and the story made sense shang chi had just the right amount of funny comments or jokes that you can still take it seriously  and at the right time  everyone was serious  i must admit  i had my doubts about awkwafina when i saw her as the role of katy  i was afraid she would crack jokes the entire move  but that's not the case  when the time was right  there was a joke  when the time came to be serious  she displayed her strong acting skills and carried her role perfectly simu liu was nothing short of perfection for me from start to finish  but to be honest  that's what i expected both tony leung chiu wai and fala chen were incredible as well as the rest of the cast  everyone played their part and played it well i feel like the movie was a great story and we took a great ride alongside the ten rings  their origin and progression of power  the father was a villain  but he had his reasons and was made to feel human i have no bad comments regarding this movie other than i don't want to wait a whole year to see part ii ,Positive
595,not that i expect coherent storylines from disney  but good grief  this film was a mess  it's all over the place!here's a little tip for the people who wrote this: pick a tone and stick with it!good cgi and very good action set pieces  hence three stars instead of one  other than that   this is the normal generic marvel phase 2 dross oh  and awkwafina is unwatchable! she's more like an irritant than an actress p  s  i'm incredibly suspicious of the o t t  positive reviews this film is getting on here  bots?,Positive
596,i'll start by saying i'm generally pretty sick of the glut of superhero movies that have dominated blockbusters for so many years now  marvel in particular have gotten to the point where i feel many of their movies are just the same old things rehashed over and over so i wasn't expecting much from this superhero film based on a character i'd never heard of  what a pleasant surprise it was  a movie with interesting characters that had plenty of depth  a superb cast good enough that even michelle yeoh's usual outstanding performance didn't upstage everyone else  beautiful visuals like you'd expect from some of the better recent chinese films rather than a marvel film  and the action and visual effects didn't disappoint well worth seeing on the big screen to truly appreciate ,Positive
597,"marvel  you sneaky sobs  is there nothing   i mean nothing at all   that you can't
turn your hands to? i'll be the first to admit that i was very sceptical about what really amounts to a glorified kung fu movie finding its place in the mcu  i need not have worried  shang chi sits right up there with the very best marvel has on show simu liu and the ever wonderful akwafina make a fantastic duo and the addition of the queenly michelle yeo and the wonderful tony leung is the icing on the cake  it's exciting  adventurous fun  so go see it  you definitely won't regret it!",Positive
598,this was just a lot of fun  the story wasn't as tight as it could have been  but i found myself enjoying the whole movie regardless  the fight choreography was bangin'  and all the action was just very well directed  everything felt purposeful and exhilarating  the beginning of the movie feels like a straight up martial arts movie and then as it progresses we get more and more fantasy elements working their way in which felt like a nice contrast  the music definitely felt like it added a lot here  i kept being reminded of how mixing different elements in with the more traditional orchestrated sounds really worked for black panther's soundtrack  and i honestly think this film did it even better  i think that  all in all  this is probably the best thing marvel has produced since endgame ,Positive
599,i watched this with very high expectations  especially after john campea and robert meyer burnett gave it glowing reviews but while they felt it was amazing  it seemed like a standard mcu film to me  it was fun  but felt like a lot of other mcu films to me  i thought there would be more mythology explored  but it felt too brief to me overall  a good film  but didn't feel great ,Positive
600,enjoyed the movie so much! the cast was awesome and i love the banter between shang and katy  wenwu is my favourite villain in mcu history so far  his character was incredible ,Positive
601,i was kind of bored through out and this is coming from a pretty big mcu shill  i think the funny side kick made the movie worse honestly  i didn't really care about her or her random  forced character arc in the last part of the movie  the fight scenes were fun  but if you saw the trailer  you saw the funnest fights  there's a dragon too  but i was just waiting for the movie to be over at that point ,Positive
602,this was a beautiful and breathtaking experience in imax  marvel has done it again and it do not disappoint!john wick level martial arts scenes and fantasy action you don't want to miss ,Positive
603,this movie was awesome  any haters are simply doing it to disagree and be a loud voice  plus i know for a fact most the haters take their opinions from someone else's review  they read some thing and decide that they don't like it before they even see it  drives me crazy ,Positive
604,    but this is a hit  they somehow succeeded expanding the vast mcu without really forcing it (it goes to show you the richness of american pocket and world culture can go a long way)  this is a solid movie  with great action sequences and cgi that delivers  mind you  shang chi is not the same without the mesmerizing tony leung and michelle yeoh (when he doesn't fight  the title character is just ok and awkwafina still isn't funny)  do not wait to watch it on tv because you should experience it at cinema first update: this movie is not aging well    i removed one star  but awkwafina's character says 6 might not be low enough ,Positive
605,i gave it 5 stars but i think it is still too generous  it has become very obvious that a shift took place in marvel universe that no longer promotes pure american but rather it panders now to various multi letter groups as well as its new master: china if i did know any better  i would think that this movie was made in hong kong (minus visual effects)  i don't know who they made this movie for but i am sure it is not the american viewer  i come to think about it  it seems to me more and more it was made to pander chinese market    ,Positive
606,let's face it  shang chi is pretty much black panther with an all asian cast  i'm sure this sounds rather cynical but here me out: the first half of the film is a down to earth james bond kind of film  then our protagonist reunited with his family halfway through and is transported to a fantasy world  only to have internal family conflicts drive the rest of the plot  sound familiar? i'm in no way saying the two are parallels but this overarching story arc is becoming cliche  black widow was sort of guilty of this in a way  but was still unique in its own right  for better or for worse  in the case of shang chi  the plot was extremely predictable  he would inevitably reunite with his family and battle his father  that didn't strip the film of all suspense  but marvel screenwriting remains an achilles heal wew! now that i've got that out of the way  here's everything i loved about this movie: this has the greatest fight choreography of any marvel movie ever  there was this beautiful  majestic rhythm and flow to every single action scene that at many parts gave me literal goosebumps  for once  the cgi complimented the action beautifully without making me cringe  in a way it was like a remake of crouching tiger  hidden dragon  in addition  the acting was above average for a marvel movie  the complex motivations of the hero and villain were realistically portrayed  speaking of the villain  xu wenwu deserves a spot next to thanos and killmonger as one of marvel's greatest antagonists  and compare to the snooze fest that was black widow  the plot was flying as fast as a dragon  finally  the cherry on top  awkwafina and the hilarious comic relief she infused into this whole story  her style was really reminiscent of guardians of the galaxy  the film wouldn't have been nearly as entertaining without her overall  this definitely exceeded expectations (although they were pretty low after black widow)  it's a pleasing popcorn movie with enough complexity and artistry to garner some awards  and for marvel fans  it's clear shang chi's existence in this universe is a game changer ,Positive
607,one of my favorite marvel movies to date  loved the acting and fx  its tough to blend martial arts fighting that looks good  no beautiful and magic  they did it  great story and pacing  highly recommended  much  much better than black panther  wonder woman 1985 and black widow combined in my opinion it's the type of super hero movie that as a kid would have inspired days of playing out the heroes with friends and many rewatches all summer long  go see it and take your 12+ old kids  they will love it!,Positive
608,this is the first marvel film since 2012's the avengers that i would call a big dud  the reasons for its failure are many; the reasons that it almost succeeds are exactly two: nora lum (awkwafina) and ben kingsley  aside from these two shining points of light  the film's an energetic flop the main reason for the failure is the script  now  i have been watching movies for five decades  and i can tell when a film is paying homage to another film  and when it's just ripping off the ideas of a better movie  this 'script' rips off a series of better movies  starting with deadpool 2  then fight club  then skyfall  then avatar  and probably a bunch of other action films i never saw  along the way  we are asked to accept a silly premise that these magic rings and the bad guy wearing them have existed for a thousand years  nope  just a dumb idea  one look at his gleaming and perfect thousand year old teeth and the whole thing falls apart  the film never recovers from that next  there is the spectacularly bad directorial choice (from the aptly named destin cretton) to have all the actors in the film display no emotions with their faces whatsoever  as mentioned above  the sole exceptions are awkwafina and kingsley  every other actor  and espeically pretty boy lead simu liu  seems to be a star graduate from the kristin stewart school of blank stares  boo  maybe cretton was going for inscrutable  but all we see is constipated the fight scenes are all generic karate video game stuff  boring at first glance  but unbearably dull after two hours  the music by joel west is one blaring trumpet after another  so forgettable that i can't remember anything except constant boring noise the production design is wonderful  as we expect from marvel: sets dripping in vivid color  crisp and exciting visuals  wonderful costumes  there are many beautiful and talented asian actors on display here  but the script is so awful that i felt embarrassed for them  as i said  awkwafina and ben kingsley save this film from being a complete flop  and their two performances are so wonderful that i am almost willing to let the rest of the garbage slide almost ,Positive
609,disappointed by the story but seems like the whole china has rated it 10/10    just an average chinese flick from the 90s made with modern technology    wasn't expecting such a turn from marvel ,Negative
610,"shang chi has great special effects and a compelling storyline but the script doesn't get too emotionally deep  this is one of the major liabilities of trying to tell a good story in about 2 hours  you simply can't because it takes time for viewers to develop care  concern  and emotional attachment to characters  so  what is best told in 2 hours? robust short stories with excellent special effects that can only be enjoyed on the big screen  to this end shang chi delivers in loads  the action is fast and the camera work while a bit dizzying captures the action very well  the only major issue i had with the plot is with the monsters that the heroes are fighting against  if you watch chinese wuxia or xianxia dramas  you know that stories involving magical beasts are always based on chinese mythology  taoism  buddhist  chinese folk religion  traditional medicine  etc  taoist immortals spouting what sounds like gibberish to laypeople is a classic character trope  the evil creatures that shang chi fights against do not fit into the xiaxia genre world view  if they are demons no explanation is given for why they are so demonic? have they been denounced by a bohisattva? are they former immortals who failed to cultivate and somehow reincarnated into the hungry ghost realm? it may just be that wuxia and xianxia are so deeply developed (and this is obvious when you watch any popular chinese historical drama  from ""eternal love"" ot ""legend of fuyao"") that deivating from these highly developed genres makes the film feel less ""chinese""  while many elements of shang chi resemble a chinese fantasy drama the lack of proper wuxia and xianxia elements makes it feel like philosophically something is missing  at least from someone who watches a lot of these dramas on rakuten viki!",Positive
611,excellent marvel movie that teaches us the history of shang chi  the fight scenes are grand  the story fascinating  and the other scenes are divine  in short  a magical film ,Positive
612,just when i thought marvel couldn't top captain marvel or guardians of the galaxy they make shang chi  i loved the banter   katy is a great character and the old guy from liverpool cracked me up  loved it  loved it  loved it! more please!!!,Positive
613,i had no comic knowledge on this one but this was still a mildly interesting movie  it wasn't really thought out or a deep story line by any means  for two hours it's a fun movie but it is not really a good indication for the next wave of marvel movies    definitely feels like another indication to me that the marvel run is over ,Positive
614,"this movie really surprised me i loved the action scenes specially the one that takes place in a bus  i wish they kept that ""grounded"" action line but at the end they go with big cgi fights  which are good but i just really loved those hand to hand action scenes also i find the villian irrelevant  he isn't too bad for you to hate him nor he isn't too good to be loved ",Positive
615,how can anyone give such a movie a 5/10 or below??? really?! it's stunningly beautiful in its very own way  the kung fu  the humor  the visuals  the atmosphere  everything  so good! i'm just gonna leave it to that! please go watch it and please ignore the bad reviews  people are so stupid that they just don't know what a good movie is anymore smh ,Positive
616,wow  this movie is so bad  the kids and wife all slowly left the room to do other things while watching  katy is so horrible of a character and annoying i was waiting for her character to get offed  unfunny  bad acting  horrible soundtrack and overall a less than generic steaming pile cranked out by disney  i would be ashamed to have my name related to this movie in any way  next time gonna get a root canal instead  would be more fun ,Negative
617,"didn't have high hope before going in because neither simu nor awkwafina was a superhero movie casting material  and mandarin is a very controversial villain of choice  but i was pleasantly surprised on how good shang chi was the chemistry between simu and awkwafina was exceptional  and tony leung's casting of not mandarin aka xu wenwu was not just amazing  but one of the best villains marvel has ever seen  it's a villain whose motivation is actually both believable and relatable  oh  and the actual ""mandarin"" was also a comical gold plus  fighting scenes were absolutely amazing  first half's martial art scenes were on par with some martial arts classics and later half of  well  typical marvel cgi stuff were quite of eye candies sure  there were few less developed character arcs like shang chi's sister but overall  this is an excellent movie that won't disappoint you ",Positive
618,finally!this movie was perfect nods to the avengers in all the right places  music is excellent  casting is incredible  visually stunning  absolutely perfect  would watch again right now  haven't felt this good about a film in a very long time  hoping to see more of shang chi in future mcu films ,Positive
619,there wasn't a shred or originality in this film  it was just a long sequence of tired old plot lines and stereotypes mixed up with ridiculous cgi  take any 5 minute sequence and it's been done to death in so many other films already   they may as well have just copied scenes from every other movie of a similar type  the whole thing was an embarrassment!,Negative
620,disney marvel has a perfect way of simplifying the comic books into something a non comic book reader can understand and follow along with  in my opinion this is the perfect movie to watch and see the excellence of telling a story without overwhelming the audience with comic book lore  this movie was good enough to get me into the movie theaters  well worth the price of admission  instant classic 🐉💍💍💍💍💍💍💍💍💍💍,Positive
621,another very mediocre movie from this dying 'universe' but some fight scenes are quite good and visual it's mostly ok too  better than capt marvel  hence the two points ,Positive
622,unfortunately  i didn't find this origin story to be as good as other reviews  it was too fast in building the characters for an origin story  they could have just focused more on the dad and his early days and his overwhelming love or first love in a 1 000 years  bring more heart into this story and the family  the father was almost a antagonist you wanted to feel some heart for  but they didn't show enough love  hopefully  he becomes a great character in phase 4 ,Positive
623,this movie is a blast and then some  it is  just like black panther was  a marvel movie and it's own thing at the same time  it brings a much needed freshness to mcu  the story is about shang chi  a kung fu fighter  who is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the ten rings organization  is this the same ten rings organization from iron man and iron man 3? i'll let the movie explain director destin daniel cretton successfully blends in his culture in the marvel format  but also keeps it real  authentic and most importantly communicates a very personal story effectively  at the heart of it  this is a movie about a dysfunctional family dealing with their family drama  i'm not going to talk about what the drama is as that will be a spoiler  but with that drama comes some of the best kung fu fights i've seen on the big screen in a long time simu liu as shang chi and awkwafina as his best friend are well known stars  but after this movie they will be upgraded to superstar status  they were brilliant in the movie and were yin to each other's yang  where simu liu brought the punches  awkwafina brought  the punchlines  they complimented each other to create the perfect balance  another character that left an impression on me is tony chiu wai leung as shang chi's father  the love hate relationship between him and shang chi is relatable and just so heartbreaking rest of the star cast is also brilliantly casted and this movie has some of the best written supporting characters  the core group consists of fala chen as shang chi's mother who is the soul of this movie  meng'er zhang as his sister who is just as much of a kick ass as shang chi and michelle yeoh as his aunt who becomes his guide and teacher  there is also a surprise character in the movie that i loved  but i am not going to talk about it and spoil it for you guys this is a marvel product so you know that the vfx & cgi are industry best  adding to that are the beautiful cinematography and the fast paced camera work  each and every fight sequence is meticulously handled and spectacularly choreographed  you have seen some of the bus fight scenes in the trailer  but there are other high stake fight scenes that will also leave you breathless you knew you were going to watch this movie when it came out  my review is just to tell you that yes  it is everything you expected and wanted it to be  i personally never doubted kevin feige  now go watch this movie and let it knock your socks off p  s    this movie has a mid credit scene and a post credit scene  so make sure you catch those ,Positive
624,"shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is a wonderful movie in so numerous ways    visually striking  with a great mastery of the staging from beginning to end so much visual poetry  the legend/adventure aspect of it is really top notch  with legends & mystical elements that grab you ever more with the story unveiling before your eyes     the humor is very pleasant (katy  played by awkwafina  brought a welcome energy & heart in each of her scenes) and adds a pretty pleasant flavor to the whole adventure i really loved the way the characters are written  with xu wenwu (tony leung) as a complex & layered figure all along the movie    and xialing (shang chi's sister  played by meng'er zhang)  as well as li (their mother) are both highly enjoyable to see express themselves on screen  they both have a lot of presence (and skills)  each in their own ways i found the entire movie very coherent  every detail makes sense and is counter balanced in a way or another    yes  there is a strong notion of balance (darkness & light  and so on)  with a lot of messages infused in both the action & dialogs  it is an extremely entertaining movie  but i really wanted to emphasize the richness and depth of its story/mythology and characters  all connected in the most organic way by the way  i loved the whole asian/chinesz myths & legends aspec of the movie  the spirit & philosophy of it all was a true delight to my eyes  with countless sci fi elements entwined in it  but all smoothly integrant of this mythology   
i think i probably put it in my top 5 marvel movies    i found the staging really majestic  from the dialog scenes to the action scenes  the humor  the flashbacks  and this new ""universe"" (mythology) that is presented here  it just all flows in such a delightful way from beginning to end marvel studios always are very very clever at hiring a great variety of talents  and they nailed it once again    destin daniel cretton (the director of the movie) is super creative and manages to construct pretty complex scenes while always masterfully telling a story  building a deeply cohesive piece ; it's all fantasy but nonetheless feels visceral and real  this movie is another marvel movie you often forget that it is a marvel movie  precisely because of its powerful and so deeply captivating mythology  and this emotional weight that you can feel over the characters  it truly sets something different  it felt like i was watching a movie in the vein of certain epic asian adventure/martial arts movies    gotta admit it's my jam  so    in addition to the marvel stuff  it's a very pleasant feeling the energy in the movie theater was fun  lots of people were excited from all these scenes that just grab you  because yes  clearly    there is a good number of mind blowing scenes in this incredible movie ! the photography and color treatment make the movie very striking    and like i said  certain scenes mesmerize you because of their beauty & mastery  or even their grand epicness ! at times  it feels like an epic fresco that you are contemplating the scene when/where the two parents meet for the first time is beyond gorgeous (the setting  the colors  the choreography  the costume design and overall design  the music & sound effects  the characters and the atmosphere as a whole) ; an absolute masterpiece of art  visually way beyond sublime  what a gift for the eyes  wow    and the 'grand final' is quite simply epic  emotionally grabbing  and of course stunning visually  with a flow of glorious shots that all are impressive a jewel ",Positive
625,a very fun and engrossing movie  tied in with the avengers and mcu  great cgi with spectacular effects that should probably be seen on a big screen with big sound  partly serious storyline  with awkwafina adding some comedy  but also she was surprisingly good as an essential character who evolves into someone more than just the comic relief   there were some plot holes  and a few things that require the viewer to suspend a little logic  but overall a great movie to watch  looking forward to seeing these characters again ,Positive
626,"production: good script even though certain scenes were predictable  solid editing  but yet again too much slow motion to try to make action scenes look good  decent cgi  it can be a little too much at times  good set pieces and wardrobe  7/10 on screen: simu liu (shang chi) and awkwafina (katy) acting was great  they have good chemistry throughout the movie which made their characters believable  decent acting from the rest of the cast  some of it was cookie cutter  solid cinematography overall  7/10 content/impact: it's great to see asian leads in american cinema that's not stereotypical  especially at a time when we see anti asian hate during covid  also  the range of imagery of powerful asian women is great to see because it combats the ""docile"" asian women motif  also  the fact that the asian woman wasn't sexualized helps combat those stereotypes  lastly  the infusion of asian culture in popular films is not only good for getting more diverse filmmaking on and behind the camera  it's also a step in having more diverse visibility which leads to more acceptance of each other  10/10 overall: good introduction to new characters shang chi and ruiwen's place in the new phase of the mcu  8/10 ",Positive
627,shang chi is arguably the most original and entertaining origin story that marvel's delivered in quite some time  coming from someone who's slowly starting to get superhero fatigue from both sides of the aisle  this one delivers  it's a spectacle  and has a family drama that feel's shakespearean at times  in many ways this is how i wanted the live action version of mulan to be ,Positive
628,jeff gordon has the most wins in all of nascar history? get your facts right at a minimum at least make it sound like you tried to get it right you kept the subtitles up too long  i almost turned it off  you also are trying way to hard with the political stuff not only in this movie but with the new capt america  knock it off!!!,Positive
629,spoiler alert: jeff gordon does not have the most nascar wins  that's richard petty anyway   cut through all the mumbojumbo and this is pretty enjoyable  with just enough tie in to the mcu at the end ,Positive
630,very predictable  nothing special  best parts of the movie are the first 30 minutes (just because of the easter eggs of other marvel movies)  lazy writing! cliche ending! woke as f!if this is phase 4  bye bye marvel!,Positive
631,akwafinas character was extremely annoying and not funny at all with forced cringy humor which ruined the movie  the fact she picked up a bow and arrow for this first time in her life and helped saved the day was ridiculous the visuals were nice though and the fight scenes were nicely choreographed lack of character of shang chi not that the acting was bad but he don't have a strong personality and there isn't anything interesting about him really the story was kinda of boring and the plot was kinda stupid ,Negative
632,"i decided to go in blind to this movie and i loved every thing about this movie it's humour  acting and it's characters but most of all the fight scenes
go and watch this movie ",Positive
633,"not sure what all the hype is about as far as non asian movie goers are concerned  the movie was ok at best  it has some great fight scenes  ok comedy  and great cinematography (it's marvel after all) but over it's kinda dumb  the first part of the movie is pretty good  the second half all the way to the end is pretty ridiculous  i won't give away anything here  my wife is asian  so i went with her family to see it last night  it was all asians in the theatre besides a few white people  i asked my sister in law why she liked it so much  and her reason was ""because i'm asian "" that's exactly how obama became president  and why black panther did well at the box office  because minorities support minorities whether the finished product is good or not  it's rather annoying  and i don't care who gets offended reading this  because it's fact! all the big babies will down vote this  but they know i'm right  marvel needs to get back to making awesome movies like thor ragnarok  and endgame  the hulk movies  black panther  captain marvel  and shang chi ain't it  sorry not sorry ",Positive
634,loving the classic spirit being brought back  also kudos for bringing the kungfu hustle icon on board this mega fu fest  this deserves a rewatch for many years since joy luck club  this piece is made by heart surely ,Positive
635,i enjoy some traditional kung fu movie choreography  i love the idea of adding some asian culture into the mcu  and this movie was looking to be pretty good especially after i saw so many positive reviews  in the end  i have mixed feelings:this movie has plenty to love: simu liu and awkwafina carry this movie  both being very cute and funny with good acting  there is some good choreography early on  the lore of the world is interesting unfortunately  there is quite a lot i didn't care for  the run time is really long for the content you're getting: my gf was asleep for the last hour  a lot of the reason for the run time is the heavy exposition  the dad is an okay villain  and i wish that i felt more of the tension between him and shang  shang's sister didn't add anything for me personally  which is surprising because i have a little sister that i did not see for a long portion of my life and then reconnected with  so i thought that i would be able to connect to their struggle  the final half hour with all of the giant cgi monsters just did not feel right for this movie  watching a giant dragon fight a giant demon felt pretty over the top  and i am still confused as to where all of this lore fits in with what we already know about the mcu there was a lot to like and a lot that took me out of the movie  which sucks because i really wanted to love this movie  it is definitely not bad and i would love to see more of this in the mcu with a little bit of refining  overall  i don't see myself choosing to watch this movie again ,Positive
636,so finally today it arrived on disney plus and before work i thought i will give a watch and see if it is that bad and yes it is this is the to be honest the woke generation and also the generation a lot more racism  this film has a lot of it and stupid dialogue that makes no sense i don't understand with movies like this the audience is insulted by the moving continuing to tell us that is a asian film about asian people  we get it so why?anyway the movie has some ok fight scenes but some of the camera work ruins going all around high low and it just makes look bad  abomination looks horrible a real down grade in cgi  for the me ten rings do nothing for the main character or his father there is nothing special about them they can both fight without the use of them the last hour of the film drags so much and is filled with cgi and is complete over the top not in a good way this movie feels completely rushed and because of covid they must have thought they had to but that is no excise the movie suffered greatly overall the downfall of marvel continues ,Positive
637,i have no idea of why they were really fighting  it felt arbitrary like they just made up something randomly that didn't really make sense  it felt more like a 80ies story then an modern mcu story this is not a superhero movie  and maybe that's why they lost me  because i was expecting a superhero film  not a b movie type story with better special effects  this might be the last mcu movie i will ever see  it is that bad    i might make an exception for captain marvel ii    :),Positive
638,have i missed something? all these glowing reviews but i found this rather clichéd and the script lacking in any originality  it starts off watchable but descends into a sluggish tiresome holed plot line  lots of lazy writing with one dimensional characters  the action is credible at the start (bus scene) but then becomes stupid and just cgi nonsense  such a shame as this had huge potential at the start but quickly became rather childish and unentertaining ,Negative
639,i'm aghast at the volume of high scoring reviews found it bland  often incoherent  cgi sub genshin impact  plundering left and centre from superior chinese films  but missing the point  feels shockingly outdated and outmoded  the intermittent attempts at humour misfire and are mostly not appropriate to the context the great tony leung really should have known better than to get mixed up in this rehash of well worn tropes it's a x for me alas ,Negative
640,best marvel movie yet! chicken  loved this movie and i hope to see another one  very different from the rest ,Positive
641,best marvel movie yet! chicken pig  loved this movie and i hope to see another one  very different from the rest ,Positive
642,please disney give back marvel and fire kevin feige whaa stupid movie and the same for black widow vanda vision and everything what was made in the last years once you got the rights  m11give it to sony they make better versions of every marvel comic they touch hawkeye is an insult to every fan around ,Negative
643,shang chi is a completely action packed movie  from start to end  sure  the story was predictable with a meek narrative  but those gaps were filled with 2 hours of crazy action  the action sequences and cinematography in itself were quite impressive  considering a good portion of the movie showed sequences without any super powers  its a good watch!,Positive
644,its your average marvel movie to the last bit  go see it if you want to be bored and slightly entertained i cannot be too bothered about this ,Negative
645,it was great to see one of the many mcu martial artist in live action and actually living up to their comic character (iron fist netflix series blows btw)  the fight scenes were fantastic along with the other action sequences  most of the characters were easy to sympathize with and the cameos were great the only thing i personally felt that didn't go over very well was aquifina's performance and comedic lines  it felt a little flat and i thought ben kingsley was way more funny than her  if it wasn't for the fact she shot the evil soul sucker in the throat saving shang chi and his sister  you could have left her out or played her character without all of the comedic misses and it would have been fine as mentioned however my son and liked the movie and it provided a nice lead in to the next big bad guy of the mcu (maybe mephisto?)  definitely worth a watch in opinion ,Positive
646,it's a good entry for this new character  it's a bit cheesy but it's fine  has some good vfx as well  best character is katy  she holds up many moments 7 5/10 from me  pretty enjoyable movie ,Positive
647,typical marvel movie  lots of action & laughs  i saw this in imax and loved it! if you are a marvel fan you will enjoy this movie  2 extra credits so stay until the end ,Positive
648,in a word this is garbage  martial arts films have been done far too much and this one so far over the top it was ridiculous  disney should not use the marvel name to disguise a film that fails to represent the marvel universe  people who enjoy martial arts in its most ludicrous form will most likely will enjoy this but after a 15 minutes i was so bored by it i could hardly keep my eyes open  disney is trying to dismantle the marvel universe and replace it with the marvel mouse universe ,Positive
649,   and a decent actor  but he couldn't save my intrest for another moneymilking lack of substance disney/marvel production  watched for 30 min and turned off because of the s*itty socalled music tormented my ears  it's just another predictable  trendvictimized hipster infested snore fest with a billion dollar special effects and no surprises  just another marvel movie for modern pop kids and i*iot sheep  only this time they wanna target the asian community  asian people must be appalled and ashamed by this pile c*ap  and speaking of asians  what's the deal with that sidekick actress  she sounds exactly like s johansson but more chronically butthurt  is she doing a voiceover? bloody hell   ,Negative
650,i didn't know what to expect going in  superhero? martial arts? and to me it ended up being more fantasy/supernatural than superhero  that being said  i liked it and i was entertained  it had a strange 80's vibe to me and i had feelings at times like i have seen this before   probably just me  the story was good  acting was good  visuals were spectacular  the middle did kinda drag a little  but overall it was a good movie if you're looking for a martial arts movie  it's not enter the dragon and it's certainly not superhero like spider man or superman  it's different  fresh  and i can see why many will love it  you could hate superheroes in general and still love this movie  so it would be a shame for people to avoid this movie because they don't like superhero movies  i say give it a shot  but don't expect anything like enter the dragon or superman  you will be disappointed ,Positive
651,"entertaining from the get go  alluring with an excellent build up and great choreography that takes you back to the 'crouching tiger' era  shang chi adds an interesting dynamic to the mcu the two main leads are compelling  i loved the comedic timing of awkwafina and the seamless choreography of the movie  everything flowed easily  and the color palette and cinematography are also compelling arguments here  my favorite scene is a harmonious ""dance"" between two characters that grabbed me to the screen and didn't let go overall  if you enjoy chinese mythology mixed in with the familiarity of the mcu then you are sure to enjoy this origin story  the best one since 'black panther'  for me at least  it got me hyped about what is coming!be on the lookout for two after credits scenes!",Positive
652,this movie is very good  the fighting at sick  action was on point  i will say the first half of the movie was better then the 2nd but overall it was a fun action movie  couple dumb parts but it's very enjoyable  like a 7 6 ,Positive
653,""" if you aim at nothing  you get nothing ""shang chi gets most of the part right with crazy action choreography which is undoubtedly the major attraction  first act is racy and has crazy action episodes and later  the recurring flashbacks served the story purpose but at the same time  slightly hindered the flow  not a big issue though as the action part kicks in and makes up for it  third act ten rings action visuals are pretty damn good and the water formation is breathtaking which reminded me of raya new guy "" simu liu "" owned the shang chi role  as his efforts are clearly visible on the screen  especially during action episodes   he nailed it with his quick reflexes  even meng'er zhang as chi's sister did put up an impressive act and awkwafina provided a bit of humor with her quirky attitude   fala chen is so beautiful  i fell head over heels for her smile  the man  tony leung stood tall and delivered with panache  his presence worked big time  always love to see michelle yeoh on the screen   she got that aura which pulls me in  trevor and morris stole the show  loved their bonding :)over all   with couple of surprises   good performances   amazing score   striking visuals and top notch action pieces makes this one an enjoyable ride throughout  had a good time at the cinemas  simu liu is a fine addition to the mcu  easily deserves solid 7 7 5 rating !!first post credit scene is whistle worthy moment   just wow!!!",Positive
654,this is a pc movie nothing good to see move along ,Positive
655,i have to agree with another reviewer here   it's probably the least marvel of all the marvel movies  had it been edited to a certain effect  one would not be able to discern it as a marvel film it's a background story of shang chi obviously  but in a way  i felt like tony leung stole a bit of the show  it's his anguish that drives the film  as without it  there wouldn't be a conflict between him and shang  seeing tony onscreen after so many years makes me want to go on a tony leung marathon  or at least watch hard boiled again  he's always been so good at conveying emotion without words michelle yeoh has small part in the film  but as always  she kicks ass and more or less plays the same exact role she played in the recent gunpowder milkshake as the older  wise auntie simu liu and awkwafina have good chemistry in the film  but i actually felt like their characters otherwise were a little bit flat  as there was not much time spent on character development  or at least in the character of shang  alot of time devoted to flashbacks but little time spent with simu in the present day  fleshing out his character  they seem like they would be fun people to hang out with? awkwafina is vital to a plot moment  but otherwise  she has little presence other than a few small comedic moments but maybe that is enough morris is cute  i need to find that stuffed animal   the special effects are fun to watch and colorful the plot is a bit simplistic  as it usually is with marvel films  it's serviceable enough  but the film starts to fall apart during last 1/3 1/4 of the film when the fantastical elements show up and certain things happen that don't quite make any sense (or at least i haven't worked out why they should make sense)  the fantasy elements don't quite work as well as just watching all the fight choreography from the earlier parts of the film  it's just not as interesting to me personally all in all  a good time and a great prelude to a labor day weekend!,Positive
656,the fight scenes were good  especially the bus scene  could have done without the flying dragon at the end  other than that  i enjoyed the movie overall ,Positive
657,"i'll be honest   marvel movies are not in my top 20 or even 50 but within the marvel ""universe"" i would say that shang chi is in my top 5  i know  it's blasphemy and all that but think about it   is it better than iron man? i would admit yes   it's origin story is arguably better  and it's characters are a lot deeper  the mandarin is a conflicted man  with evil but good as well  like real life  is this movie better than the avengers or ragnarok or infinity wars? hard to say  which means it's right up there with the best (of marvel) in my opinion plus  i'm a sucker for chinese movies with the chinese language being spoken   1 of my favourite of all times  if not my absolute favourite  is of course 'hero ' the chinese language and the artistry of it's culture are magnificent all in all  well done marvel  director destin  and all those who worked to make this movie a reality  this is not just your average summer action movie; it's close to being a masterpiece  and the humour is pretty swell too!cheers ",Positive
658,there is some good acting in this movie  cinematography and visual effects  certainly some well choreographed action and martial arts scenes  however  the story line is somewhat lacking  it also tries its hand at some comic moments but most don't cut the mustard  i'm managed a couple of small giggles along with my fellow cinema going compatriots ,Positive
659,cookie cutter cultural cash grab  cynical boring slog  how many goddamn times is marvel going to tell the same story?i do love awkwafina  she's cute and hilarious but she's not enough to help this film  once again the cgi is jarringly awful  the fake looking environments and action suck you right out of the illusion ,Negative
660,i'm gonna keep this short  the acting is all first rate from everyone  the editing of the fight scenes are fantastic and first rate  the story is ok but pretty predictable  ben kingsleys appearance is fun  the only reason i'm giving this a 6 is the cgi is laughably bad  for disney/marvel to have cg that look like they are from another film ben kingsley starred in  a sound of thunder  is just pathetic  completely took me out of the film in the second half  but the first half was fun and the actors are great ,Positive
661,i was actually borderline giving this a 7 out of 10 but can't quite bring myself to do it because the middle is so booooooring!i did however  on the whole really enjoy this but i did think that it was more about the whole cast rather than an origin story of shang chi because an awful lot of attention seems to be given his sister and his friend katy which seemed odd to me?but sort of odd in a good way because they managed to flesh the characters out enough to make them seem like 'characters' rather than expendable supporting cast the first third of the movie was for me  the strongest and seeing the full fight scene on the bus shown in the trailer made me appreciate the choreography that went into this  the final third was fine    i wasn't bored    the middle though? nah :(i preferred this to black widow because it's part of the new phase and not some remnant carry over and just felt fresh!there's also some fairly ok humour in there (a lot which misses the mark too though)    yeah  it was good  you should go see it if you like the mcu ,Positive
662,it has a couple of cool fights  and the cgi fest at the end was fun  other than that  it doesn't offer anything else no character development no meaningful story ,Positive
663,absolutely loved it  imo  it's the best mcu movie and that's saying a lot  coming from me  it's original  has a great story  good screenplay  excellent fight scenes with the actors (not stuntmen)  the villain has a unique agenda (not just to kill the hero or take over the world)  the origin story is told perfectly  the superpower (the rings) is really interesting  and the music is fantastic  it finally bumped iron man down to #2 on my mcu list ,Positive
664,laugh  fights  drama  comedy  beautiful landscapes  dragons  martial arts   it's all wrapped up nice and smoothly!i had an amazing time watching it!also the music was great!worth watching it!,Positive
665,"disclaimer: i watched the spanish dubbed version of this film  therefore  i am unable to provide criticism of the original actors' acting in this film shang chi is a hit! one of my favorite marvel films for sure  while it indeed takes place in the mcu  it just doesn't feel like other marvel films  in a good way  that is  our protagonist has no real superpowers  and the cheesy  outlandish fictional elements characteristic of many other marvel films have been exchanged for more mystical  creative elements  as another reviewer has put it  it's almost as if this film belonged more to the harry potter universe than the mcu the story revolves around shaun (simu liu) and his friend katy (awkwafina)  two young valet drivers living in san francisco  after a rather exhilarating episode on the bus to work where a group of men steal shaun's jade pendant  he decides to visit his sister xialing (meng'er zhang) in china to warn her that they'll be going after her next  katy insists on joining  and during the plane ride  shaun reveals to her his true identity and back story: he is shang chi  a great martial arts warrior from china whose father xu wenwu (brilliantly cast by tony chiu wai leung) possesses the titular legendary rings (which are actually more like bracelets  if you ask me)  which give him god like power and immortality  they wrap around his forearms and glow bright blue  and seem to have some mystical magnetic properties  ever since shang chi and his sister's mother li (fala chen) died when they were children  their father has not been right in the head and has developed an obsession for the bracelets  one day he starts hearing what he believes to be his wife's voice call out to him  and thus sets out to reunite with her in the secret city of ta lo  her hometown which is very hard to get to  our heroes must stop him before he opens up pandora's box the visuals in this film are spectacular  especially the creative uses of bright  contrasting colors  what's really neat about this film is how the first half portrays modern chinese culture and the second half portrays a more traditional chinese culture  you get the best of both worlds  if you will  i am no expert on chinese culture  by any means  but this film was made in a way that i believe respects it  the film also makes use of mandarin language from time to time (particularly during flashbacks)  which gives it more a sense of authenticity than having all the chinese characters speak english all the time i do have a slight criticism  in avengers endgame  there was an extremely cheesy and cringeworthy scene near the end where all the female characters were shown side by side  all the black characters were shown side by side  etc  the rather random appearance of the character wong in this movie is more or less an extension of that scene  it's as if kevin feige (or perhaps director destin daniel cretton) said  ""oh  we have this new shang chi movie featuring a mostly asian cast  let's throw wong from dr  strange in there because he's asian "" it's more realistic to show characters of different races working together  and it sends a better message as well  in the same way black panther features a mostly black cast  it's as if marvel wants to make up for its previous exclusion of asian characters by cramming as many as they can into this one movie  we will see what the future has in store for shang chi and characters of color in the mcu overall  i really can't complain too much about this film  some of the special effects (in particular the ""blast"" sound effects attributed to the rings) are over the top  but the cgi in general is stellar  and the setting and costumes are fun and fresh  the fight scenes in particular are great  the presence of the character katy is a bit cliché to the superhero genre; she felt a lot like the equivalent of peter parker's friend ned in the tom holland spiderman movies  that is  she really only serves the purpose of being the protagonist's best friend and because of that is capable of doing things she otherwise wouldn't be capable of doing  for the sake of the plot  it would have been cool if shang chi instead had a sensei like teacher to guide him (as is the case with liam nesson's raz al ghul in batman begins)  but i guess that role is played by his dad during flashback scenes  after all  this isn't really an origin story  i also would have liked to see them do more with shang chi's sister  because she doesn't get nearly as much screen time and character development as he does  some of the humor fell flat  but  as i said in the disclaimer  i watched the spanish dubbed version  so maybe it's actually funnier in the original english  in conclusion  shang chi exceeded my expectations  and i will likely be watching it again in the near future ",Positive
666,well  what can i say? i love anything asian lol  i've waited so long to see awkwafina be romantically involved with a marvel superhero!! shang chi is really worth the wait and mind you  it's nothing cheesy but i love the whole plot  cars  arrows  dragons  and ben kingsley! it's simply a complicated magical family affair but the most interesting question is    how does this specific event connect us to a point in time in the marvel universe?,Positive
667,i was blown away by the great storyline from start to finish  amazing choreography  stunning visuals  and surreal locales  it's happy  it's sad  it's funny  it's touching  it knows when to be serious and knows when to be hilarious  the blend between the classic asian traditions and the modern world was a definite bonus  plus  it focuses on a blend between mythical and natural  besides that  it ties into the mcu seamlessly  the movie thankfully explains a connection between the faux ten rings in the iron man movies and the actual ten rings  i also enjoyed all of the easter eggs  this movie was worth the wait ,Positive
668,10/10 because of morris  morris is the best character and the best part about this movie  along with trevor  would watch again because of morris ,Positive
669,flawless  inspirational  happiness  tears  marvel redemption?!?!?!?! dragons!!!!!!!! i will amend tomorrow an when in full minded review mode (sober) so yeah! appreciation!!! need some characters lol ,Positive
670,great movie  and one of my favourite mcu movies (just behind thor ragnarok and guardians of the galaxy volume one)  amazing cast  fresh story  and out of this world cgi! highly suggest you see it in a theatre  for the full experience!the loss of the one star is because as an asian martial arts movie  it doesn't entirely live up to the greats that have come before it (crouching tiger  hero  etc)  saying it is close though  is praise enough!very excited this group is part of the mcu  excited to see more!,Positive
671,this is one of the best marvel movies i've ever watched and believe me  it ain't a waste of time like the other people are telling you    just go watch the damn movie already haha!,Positive
672,amazing movie  i'm not a big marvel buff  i like all the movies just fine  i watched this on a plane and i never wanted it to end  as soon as it ended i almost restarted it from the beginning but there was only 20min left in the flight  it's like avatar meets marvel  beautiful choreography  fight scenes seemed like a synchronized dance ,Positive
673,shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is one of the best comic book movies i've seen! great humor and intense action throughout the film! you can sympathize with the villain! the music is phenomenal (possible mcu best)  go watch it!,Positive
674,marvel certainly is the aaa cinematography and cgi shop  the movie is a good looking product and the action scenes are enjoyable to watch however those qualities are present in most if not all marvel movies  and this one has nothing else going for it  i watched it only 2 weeks ago and i barely remember the plot simu liu did decent in the main role  a bit wooden but overall okay for an unknown actor  awkwafina once again delivered awkwafina  i have no idea how she keeps getting work  a proper actress would have done better  but i guess they wanted comedy relief anyway  it's good for a single viewing and i doubt you would ever want a second ,Positive
675,there are so many cool things about this movie  but they forgot to flesh out the characters a little bit  in particularly how shang chi even uses or gets his power  all of it very convenient and feels kinda manufactured for the purpose of having cool fights and special effects  those however i will say are exceptional  and for and origin story it turned out pretty cool how they layered in the character development through out  loved seeing something culturally and visually different  this was way better than eternals ,Positive
676,went in with low expectation  of maybe cultural butchering or what not  came out infatuated with wenwu  where did all the serious talent like tony leung go at international stage??! this is also the first marvel film that felt very disney to me  the brand is there  overall the story is great especially till the father vs son fight  the chinese dragon  and lions? delicious choice  love it! but  the cgi monsters as main climax villain    yuck  what a boooooring turn of events  booo disney and your boring aliens and the unknown are bad  oh  like 100 years ago  ooh asians bad cause they are so alien  anything alien baaaaad  main bad ,Negative
677,really good film  the tone is great  funny when it should be  fight scenes are great  the story is great  and the cast is brilliant   with one exception  awkwafina is awful but it is what it is definitely recommend anyone to see this  really good ,Positive
678,the movie is fine and thats about it  it is way overhyped and marvel fans just spam review 10 stars on anything marvel related for some weird reason i dont know what else to say other than the story was predictable and the only good part was the visuals  the fighting and some of the actors ,Positive
679,"to avoid long review  here are some bullet points  chinese audience and all of us deserve better positive:
actors are ok  younger ones were even better  fighting / choreography is good
some scenes are well made negative:
 half of the movie is in mandarin  you can't focus  either don't put subtitles at all or use english  animation and effects are 2nd rate
 pace is weird
 humor isn't bad but i didn't feel it  starts to early  too many explanations and flashbacks  > bad writing
 music at some weird parts
 i watched it on d+ and not at the highest resolution but the quality was on a tv show level  usually at higher res it looks worse there is no disney magic like in mulan or the quality that you expect  it was like pilot movie ",Positive
680,i really liked the movie  the fight scenes were great and cgi was excellent  my only confusion was why some characters were so shocked that there were mystical creatures and the story that shawn and katie was telling their friends was so unbelievable to them especially since the timeline of this movie takes place after end game  did they not see aliens come down with crazy abilities? i think once this happens  someone has to believe that anything is possible ,Positive
681,every time i hear the marvel opening in theaters  i get chills and i am so happy that i saw this film in theaters  shang chi and the legend of the ten rings  kicks off a new wave of the mcu and i am so excited for the journey that lies ahead  great characters  narrative  score  and action overall  totally worth the watch! (make sure to stay for all the mid/after credit scenes!),Positive
682,"i love all the movies from them but shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is one of my favorite marvel movies  it really managed to make a very nice movie  the story is usually a gorgeous one  the characters are very nice and you become very invested in the movie i was amazed at what good fight sequences are in the movie like this  the best since the avengers 2012 and captain america: the winter soldier 2014 maybe even better the cgi is incredible  i only saw such special effects on avatar i have to say that i ran and saw the fight on the bus 5 times  it's awesome     it manages to give you an energy boost  so cool
the story is extraordinary  shang chi confronts the past he thought he left behind  when his father wants to reunite his lost family xu wenwu played by tony leung is such a good villain  you understand why he does this  you empathize with him and although you know that the way he acts is wrong you understand his pain  besides being a villain he is also my father and everything he wants to release his wife a very good villain  certainly one of the best villains of this year this movie blow me away  i love it  lots of love from bangladesh 🇧🇩",Positive
683,marvel movies have truly just become child's movies very predictable and boring storing with such mediocre writing  it is truly a joke to call something like this 'cinema',Negative
684,when a marvel movie released audience has a certain expectation how it should be  and this movie exceeds the expectations for a marvel movie with a great story and great cast  casting  directing and specially the art direction of the movie had a certain quality which usually could not see in most of the movies in recent past overall the mystical theme of the movie added a special feel to marvel movies ,Positive
685,watch it for the action scenes  because that is all there is  forget about the story and wait for the next fight  the underlying story is unoriginal and uninspired  i understand disney did this to get a pat on the back  but they need to slow down and focus on making better movies ,Negative
686,clever story with amazing martial arts and interesting backdrops  i enjoyed and appreciated the english subtitles that were clear to read and on onscreen longer the most movie subtitles  the martial arts was exhilarating! loved it! the cgi was colorful and creative  this film should win multiple oscar awards!!this movie was so entertaining i must see it again!!,Positive
687,shang chi has instantly entered my top 5 of marvel movies  there is so much to adore about this movie  the visuals are beautiful  the villain is compelling  the last sequence isn't very predictable  as superhero movies can often be  the characters all have a level of depth that is often missing from the supporting characters in superhero movies  and i was pleased that they didn't marginalize xialing as it would've been easy to do  i don't know much about the different disciplines of martial arts  but it seems very similar to avatar: the last airbender in how they drew inspiration from different real world fighting styles for different fighters in the movie  if i compare the acting to the other movies i consider the best to produced by marvel (infinity war  ragnarok  winter soldier  etc )  shang chi is a notch below  but it blows every other marvel movie out of the water when it comes to action and choreography  the bus scene in the first act has easily become my favorite sequence in any marvel film  origin films often fall into the same traps  but shang chi doesn't  maybe because many didn't know much about the character  but even so  typical tropes like training sequences were done better in shang chi  and the story didn't linger on his youth too much ,Positive
688,the movie was boring and unsurprising  there was never a time that i had to worry about any of the characters  about 95% of the movie was predictable and the only thing that really surprised me is that they didn't kill of either of the white characters  the sister was entirely unnecessary and another marvel mary sue  every time she was on screen  all tension was lost if marvel wrote female characters as competent people who can sometimes fail  it would make for a more compelling story  but as long as they have to push female empowerment messages like they are trying to break through to people still living in the 1920's  it will always come off as boring and unnecessary  how did the dragon go from being super powerful to all of a sudden super weak everytime they wanted the sister to participate?akwafina was annoying but sometimes a little funny  i would go back and fourth between liking her character and not liking her character at all  if they kept akwafina and didn't have the sister or if the sister had faults and they took out akwafina  it would have made for a much better story and no one likes captain marvel aside from about 1% of the entire marvel fan base  including the actors  why do they keep trying to shove her into end credit scenes when she just makes people more disappointed everytime she's on screen?why is banner's arm in a sling? hulk prevents him from getting seriously injured  so it just doesn't make sense these woke writers need to start paying attention to the source material and stop making up rules as they go ,Negative
689,i have always admired chinese culture and ofcourse kungfu  and we get both along with great fun  action  visuals and some surprises along the way   go watch it folks   its an awesome movie ,Positive
690,stupid on every level  fights are entertaining  but would rather watch any bad 70's chop socky movie over this poorly written  ludicrous story  several of the characters are so unrelateable it makes me wonder if the writers  director or actors have ever met another person  not worth the time to write this review except that somehow this is getting a 7 9 at this moment which cannot be real  imdb should be embarrassed shilling for this mess ,Negative
691,kind of boring film  the premise is interesting  but kind of comedic all over and with little compromise with being convincing  i mean  marvel films have this requirement for suspension of disbelief by default  but this film kind of explains very little and the character's interaction is shallow and not very meaningful  the end is predictable  everything looks artificial perhaps we are all vaccinated against marvel's all over the place magic to a point that everything looks familiar  boring and flat  or perhaps the film is just not that great my big problem with this film is the bus sequence at the start  it eeps going downhill  i mean   if you can make turns with the bus  why does it keep going down all the time? turn left twice  it will go uphill instead of downhill and decelerate  then turn to any side and it should come to a standstill  not very clever  guys ,Negative
692,before anyone thinks i am a straight white male who is not allowed to have opinions  let me tell you i am asian myself  now the movie is truly overrated  action is good  virtue signaling was limited but not absent  cliche mcu formula really is off putting  the only novelty was the looks of the actors  i did not get overly bored but i would not have missed much if i did not watch it ,Positive
693,shang chi and the legand of the ten rings is definitely a great movie to see ,Positive
694,lovely plot  great characters  awesome designs & costumes  as a martial artist fan i loved the fight choreography & stunts  they felt fresh and authentic the mix between martial arts  action  fantasy & drama was great  i was worried about the movie  when i watched the trailer  the cgi effects were amazing  just felt like it didn't needed it  the movie got its own marvel flavor  when the cgi scenes took over i had a lot of fun during watching  specially the fighting scenes  action scenes and with a lovely humor the acting was fantastic  shang chi's character development was great just overshadowed by his fathers character in my opinion  cause the story of his father was somehow more interesting  the chemistry between shang chi & katy was the icing on the cake  so lovely and perfectly matches into the movie this is the first hollywood movie for tony leung  he did an amazing job i think it's safe to say they did well to represent asian culture on a big movie screen  i highly recommend this to every marvel fan  they did an outstanding job ,Positive
695,awesome fighting scene  the pace of movie is fast yet engaging  this is how superhero movie should like  good vfx in the beginning and then the vfx going downhill in last fight  which is dissapointing ,Positive
696,i had least expectations about this movie  i thought probably it would have some fight sequences which depicts a typical chinese movie  but it is more than that  i had an awesome theatre experience after endgame  seriously guys  don't miss this one ,Positive
697,it felt like at at any moment eddie murphy was going to pop in  but in the absence of that slap stick an adequate side kick is there  for some this is ok  however  this is marvel or at least it was at some point  it's watered down into something that is not within the mcu  not saying don't watch it  please do  but after you watch it it doesn't leave you coming back for more  it would take an act of congress to get me to watch a sequel  i'd rather watch will smith make a come back in aladdin 2  the human adventures ,Positive
698,very good movie  perfect casting great visuals good story and direction makes it enjoyable the screenplay was a little bit predictable like formulatic marvel movie  i totally recommend to see this one in theaters because it was made to have that kind of experience ,Positive
699,i'm a sucker for a good quality martial arts fight scene  and this has many of them  every one is perfect  the movie has humor  heart  and really amazing fight scenes  i love the visual effects  the tradition and culture of the rich chinese people  it overall just worked and i'm so excited to go see it for a second time ,Positive
700,in a world where the mcu movies are getting more and more predictable  i thought this was a great way to mix it up! this was an amazing way to introduce one of the lesser known characters within the marvel universe :),Positive
701,this film is a load of nonsense  the fight scenes aren't anything new you've seen them all before   save your time and energy and watch an episode of power rangers   its the same thing  the special effects aren't even all that     pure green screen rubbish ,Positive
702,the best thing about this film is the choreography  it  is  amazing  except for that  the story is decent  characters are fine  and it's nice to see some good asian representation  altogether not a bad movie ,Positive
703,having been starved for a marvel movie and after the fiasco that was black widow  i think many are rating this movie higher than it deserves a running time of 2hr and 13 min felt more like 2 and a half hrs  awkwafina  meant to be the comedic sidekick  was completely out of place  she had no skill set  could not speak chinese and was not particularly funny  i did not like the pacing particularly the numerous flashbacks to the past  instead of attempting to subvert our expectations by springing surprises on the audience as it relates to a character's character it would have worked better to have a linear timeline  doc ock was not shown to be evil out of the box and then through flashbacks is it explained why he is the way he is finally  i felt that cinematically you can see similarities between this movie and other martial arts movies released in the early 2000s (hero  the forbidden kingdom) specifically in some fight scenes ,Positive
704,stay where you are shang chi don't go near to my avengers lol! i rate you because your under mcu but sorry not interested in you you don't get my attention   ,Positive
705,"shang chi movie review
no spoilers
oh wow! i really loved this film! it really went above and beyond my expectations  to tell you the truth i had no idea of how it would play out  as a matter of fact i am pretty good at predicting this but this movie really had me guessing  i highly recommend to watch this film  of course it's a disney film so it gave vibes similar to mulan and of course it's an oriental film so it gave vibes of crouching tiger hidden dragon  and of course it's a marvel comics film but this isn't your regular marvel movie  i highly recommend you to watch it if you haven't already  you are going to love it  trust me  this is worth every penny ",Positive
706,absolutely loved this film  fabulous from start to finish  can't wait for the next one  the acting and the story was ace  the special affects was amazing  love love love it ,Positive
707,i am not sure what other people watched but this movie is so boring  there is nothing new here which you haven't watched before  if you are praising it for the kung fu then better go and watch chinese movies with a lot more kung fu action and better story than this one here is my take with spoilers 1  they showed the main guy's father i e the mandalorian which was shown in iron man 3(the fake one) is alive from thousand year and he is very brutal & has won hundreds of battles and blah blah blah   then how come a guy who has won so many battles doesn't even have a billion dollar even after thousand year when he gets marry to the love of his life i am sure he wants to give her all the happiness but the guy is poor some local mafia people come to his house to take their money which he owes them but he wasn't at home that time and they kill his wife i mean wth is this?the director actually thought that a brutal  passionate king alive for thousand year with ten rings power can't even provide basic things to his family even after winning hundreds of battles who came with this plot?2  our main guy i e the hero of the story shang chi is living the life of a valet  his father sends his people to get a locket from him which his mother gave him and his sister shang chi and his father's goons fights off almost killing everyone in the bus and ruining at least a dozen cars but goons takes off the locket then hero goes to warn his sister and there also his father's goons fight off after a long fight and almost 20 30 people dead his father comes in the scene and says he wanna take them home i mean wth again?if he wanted to take his kids home then why send his people to fight and let die so many people to get 2 lockets just speak to the kids and ask them to come home 3  they go home and his father plans to attack his wife's native place as he thinks she is alive and living there  those 2 lockets shows the map of the village and the kids disagrees and father locks them there they meet the fake mandalorian from iron man 3(ben kinsley) & escapes with him as he has one of the animal from their mother's village who knows the map to the village oh man i am so tired of writing this so by now u know they reach the village and even there father reaches there very easily and fight happens our hero gets the ten rings and saves everyone on a dragon it really can't get worse than this we all have seen so many action vfx movies by now that nothing amazes anymore after watching marvel for more than 10 years we really don't deserve these underdog superhero stories these are becoming so boringwe deserve better i have no idea what people liked in this and why this movie has so high rating ,Positive
708,can't wait to see what else is to come from shang chi fantastic from start to finish!well worth the watch ,Positive
709,i'm sorry  but this was rubbish  acting was poor  nothing made any sense  nothimg original  not got much hope for next phase of marvel if this is anything to go by ,Negative
710,an incredible mcu film  it offers nothing too cerebral  but that is not the main focus of the film  the comedy  the action  the themes  the choreography and the vibrant visuals make this film a standout among similar standalone marvel films  while the layered and truly epic soundtrack is the finishing touch  while some of the effects and the pacing perhaps could have been a little more polished  and the final battle had some weaknesses  this is a colourful  emotional and fun rollercoaster of a film  tony leung is by far the standout member of the cast  delivering a captivating and even sympathetic villain  simu liu holds his own  but needs more time to really shine as a new marvel superhero while meng'er zhang  awkwafina and fala chen are integral to this film's effectiveness  overall  this fun and touching movie is an exemplar of the 'marvel formula' and its strengths ,Positive
711,i enjoyed the movie but she is very cringe  if she hadn't been in it maybe a 9/10! of the more recent movies this has definitely been my favorite  i would definitely recommend it ,Positive
712,disney made a terrible copycat of the black panther  the script was racially stereotypical and predictable  there was not one original idea in this movie  the cgi was pretty bad as well  way too much swearing  can one marvel writer not come up with a funny response instead of a curse whenever something blows up? i am pretty much done with disney at this point ,Negative
713,marvel is becoming now apple  no matter what you'll buy there products and have to say nicer even you can buy same kind of products somewhere else  now this movie disappoints me so many places first of all storytelling  i don't know when the story start and where it goes  somehow i felt it takes unnecessarily emotional point  i can't say i am fully disappoint there are lot of good action scenes  very good acting  very good vfx  the only missing is nice story  this story not convinced me properly  i can only give 5 out of 10 ratings but because of marble franchise and i believe their future that's the reason i give 6 out of 10 ratings ,Positive
714,when you thought the mcu pulled everything out of the closet  this movie has everything  amazing special effects  good editing  deserved character development and an intriguing plot  this movie is a solid blockbuster and very aesthetically pleasing the only bad thing about it was that at some point in the movie  it's enough  the ending felt like it was being dragged out this is the best mcu origin story by far ,Positive
715,i've watched this movie twice so far and i thought i'd enjoy it less on the rewatch  but i found it just as good shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is a very epic introduction to this character and keeps you invested in his origin story  while it's definitely not the most original story  they do a good job at making the character relatable enough to keep you emotionally invested awkwafina was a nice addition to the movie and while some of her jokes were pretty corny  they still made me laugh (even on rewatch) the highlights of the movie are definitely the bus scene near the beginning and the final beautiful action sequence  but all the action in general in this movie is pretty amazing while it has a different vibe than most mcu movies  the formula is definitely still there  this isn't necessarily a bad thing  but it would have been nice for this movie to have a bit more of a unique story otherwise this is a stunning cinema experience  and even watching at home it will make you feel like you're in a movie theatre  definitely recommend!,Positive
716,shang chi was worth the wait and the hype  i immediately fell in love with all the characters because of their charm and charisma on the screen  the fighting scenes were well choreographed and filmed  i felt like i had a front row seat to some of the most artistic and beautiful fighting sequences on the screen and mcu history  the character development was also astounding and i cannot wait to see where they go! it was a work of art  this movie's cast was perfect as well as the directing and music  it is a must see for mcu and superhero fans alike ,Positive
717,i'm not going to downplay this movie for it's action  visuals and comedy (but not as much comedy as you'd expect from a marvel movie)  if you just want an entertaining movie  i think the mcu has figured that much out at this point  oddly enough  awkwafina is the best part of this movie  i like her better in this than other things i've seen her in the main character  shang chi  really sells this movie  simu liu knocks it out of the park with his perfomance  he knows how to play an everyman  his chemistry with awkwafina works well and are the best scenes in the movie  i thought it was interesting that  like many other marvel characters  he's a superhero who could be a regular guy walking down the street  you wouldn't know unless you knew his backstory (and believed it)  i also liked the whole transition where he faces his true identity in finally confronting his father (the main antogonist) so the weakpoints  it's just as you'd expect  the villain is about as 2 dimensional as it gets  i didn't really care for him even as the credits rolled  the fact that he was shang chi's father is literally the only thing making him relevant to the story or remotely interesting  even the whole ten rings super power didn't completely sell me  it looked cool but beyond that  it was a guy with metal rings on his arms   which makes him   the most powerful man in world history? sure  whatever the other (and i would say biggest) weakpoint is the story  like i began this review  this has great visuals  action and is a generally entertaining movie  but   i can't help but think there are marvel screenwriters who are copy/pasting stories from previous marvel movies  the third act was borderline ripped from black panther  it's a shame because i think this movie  in a vacuum  is really something special without elements feeling regurgitated from the mcu's back catalogue look  i get it  sometimes you want the same thing  i'm not going to stop you from watching marvel  pixar and disney cartoon movies (or their live action remakes)  but i personally have never heard of shang chi from the comics  barely knew of most of these actors and just feel less invested than i was pre avengers: endgame  it feels odd waiting for x men  deadpool  wolverine  iron fist  fantastic 4  blade  new avengers and others to join the mcu but we're watching this while we wait  do we need this many mcu movies? i guess that's not for me to decide ,Positive
718,this movie was amazing  beautiful to look at and had awesome action scenes as well as gripping story that at times even pulled on your heart strings  this is hands down one of the best marvel films that's ever come out so far  wow  what a darn movie!!!!,Positive
719,shang chi what can i say other than the first hour was enjoyable with the whole backstory of the two siblings and the origins of the ten rings and its rival clan  the martial arts was also great     but then it did what i was afraid it would do in the 2nd half of the movie and that was become a poor version and knock off of crouching tiger hidden  with silly wire work and theatrics that makes it out of place that it was like two different movies got cut and stitched together ,Negative
720,this is not a superhero movie  this is a very entertaining and well acted chinese film  a must see absolutely worth your time and money   my grade: a ,Positive
721,i started to watch the movie with no expectation  the movie started well  the bus fight is very good compared to other fights thought the movie is lagging still it is interesting at times actor acted well sure shot win for marvel ,Positive
722,the film was interesting and  of course  action  which can be fun and of course has its own fans  but from time to time the film gets a little bored  it can't be said that it had powerful actors  but it was enough for their roles  it was very imaginative and special effects were pleasant  the content of the film was relative and the film had a good ending that is very attractive to the viewer  but i expected more and couldn't get the original demand  bring me over  and it was just fun ,Positive
723,that katy girl was freaking horrible and jokes were awful af  she ruins every scene she is in with some of the worst acting ever witnessed  every scene she is either telling a joke that falls flat as hell or has a exaggerated gaping mouth stare while no one else looks surprised then after all that she shoots a moving dragon in the throat with an arrow from like a mile away with like two days of training to save the day  omg!the rest of the movie was fine i guess  kung fu and dragons baby!,Negative
724,i was skeptical that marvel could recover from black widow and super hero fatigue  they surprised me with this little gem though  totally enjoyable and not so formulaic that you felt like it wasn't its own thing  very happy with this character!,Positive
725,while it was a good movie it had very little to do with shang chi master of kung fu from the comics  outside of the name shang chi  his father being evil and one of the villains razorfist the movie was completely different from the comic character  in the comics his father is fu manchu  he does not have the 10 rings  the mandrian does though they are actually finger sized rings  razorfist has a normal blade in place of his hand not a bloody light saber  fu manchu does have an extended life but it it due to a serum he takes  i don't remember shang chi having a sister in the 100+ comics i read  at one point he did have an identical twin or maybe it was a clone  so again it was a good movie it just ruined it for me that they completely changed the story from the comics ,Positive
726,"'shang chi and the legend of the ten rings' is absolutely on my list of favorite marvel movies  2021 has been full of hyped up films that have ultimately left me disappointed  but this one lives up to every bit of its hype the action from beginning to end was some of the best i've seen in a marvel movie or in general in a very long time  the choreography  especially when performed by michelle yeoh  meng'er zhang  and fala chen (and stunt doubles) felt like poetry in motion  everything was done with so much grace and elegance that i did not want it to end  simu liu brought both charisma and charm as shang chi while delivering some amazing action sequences too  he was nothing short of fitting for the role  and to my surprise ""awkwafina"" was not as unbearable as i assumed she would be the movie does lose some momentum in the 3rd act as it slows down a bit and takes a deeper dive into the story  but quickly picks back up as you head into the final battle  the set and cgi used creates some breathtaking shots that adds to the greatness of the film marvel fan or not this film is worth going to see ",Positive
727,this movie is captivating! put it on as essentially background noise and ended up being pleasantly surprised  very well written and executed  possibly even the best made marvel movie  i don't have any criticism  just positives to say about this film  i even started rewatching it again the other night because it's that good  a great one for the entire family ,Positive
728,for all intents and purposes this movie was your typical dc movie  and  for a marvel film that's every bit the insult it is intended to be  the over the top praise this effort has generated is either born from pure loyal slappies or people wishing to seem culturally progressive praising a ridiculously shallow cotton candy movie every character is superficial and the lead has the charisma of wet bread  the story itself is basic and never gives the viewer a chance to connect with any character or even their motivations  the tone jumps everywhere as if the director was handed a jigsaw puzzle worth of scenes and asked to string them together to frame cgi madness  honestly from the completely silly over the top opening bus brawl through the insane cgi third act dragon fight  i don't remember ever rolling my eyes so much at a marvel studios endeavor  well  maybe the third act of black widow but that just makes me realize how far phase four has wandered away from what made the mcu great  there are some visually stunning scenes and an overall good idea at play but everything falls in to some sort of kiddy cartoon category where nothing has any consequence either physically or emotionally ,Positive
729,i enjoyed seeing the asian culture mixed with american culture especially that this is a marvel movie  very enjoyable  and as mentioned different and creative ,Positive
730,well this is where we are going with marvel movies now  very simple plots and poor cgi i dont know if this was rushed of they just don't care  but the cgi looks about the quality of a computer game  maybe you wouldn't notice if you were watching on a tv or your phone but it fails on the big screen story is predictable  nothing novel or original  i guess the production line that is disney will just be churning these movies out now ,Negative
731,what the hell did i just watch? while nice to look at  the story makes no sense and is all over the place  worst movie in the mcu by far   lost count of the lame and cringe worthy moments ,Negative
732,"i really liked how the movie started and went in a certain direction for like the first hour but after that point  the movie suddenly becomes a lot more mystical and decides to sway from its direction which did more harm than good to the movie in my opinion  by the end  i just wanted to watch some cool looking  well choreographed hand to hand fight scenes but what i got was characters ""kamehameha""ing each other and gigantic beasts fighting along  but i guess i can't complain  i knew what i was going to get since this is a mcu movie after all ",Positive
733,there's no way people here this movie  it's not near perfect and not the best marvel movie but c'mon  this was epic and the plot was not bad at all  definitely had epic fight scenes  settings and moment ,Positive
734,"this movie makes black widow look like an oscar winning screenplay the story is just soooo bad  there's way too much raw exposition about past events  it feels like half the movie is spent recounting the past in stale narrative exposition  when this much backstory is needed  then you're trying to pack too much into a single film character motivations are unclear  shang chi's behavior is inexplicable at times  and his sidekick's behavior is similarly confusing  the movie opens with the two of them in low paying jobs  yet somehow they are jet set world travelers at the drop of a hat  shang continually puts his friend in life threatening danger the movie is weakened by fan service  the callback to iron man 3 makes zero sense  casting ben kingsley for comedic relief does nothing for the story this movie all but breaks the mcu's continuity and overarching story  it introduces new dimensions  races and powers without regard for existing storylines cameos don't help  kingsley's trevor slattery feels about 10 years too late and most of his previous story arc from ""iron man 3"" and ""hail to the king"" is negated and/or ignored  wong is used as comic relief  but doesn't help much more than that there's nothing fresh in this movie  just disney trying to cash in on an inferior product ",Negative
735,this movie was highly anticipated and it held up to my expectations  as a massive marvel fan  this movie had me fully engaged from start to finish  the fight sequences were amazing! they were very different from most movies  making them very unique  every actor gave a wonderful performance as well  i'm not rating this one a 10/10 because of the dragon sequence towards the end  it was awesome at the start  but it seemed to drag out a bit too long  still very entertaining though  even if you're not a marvel fan  i still highly recommend seeing this film  you don't need much marvel background when seeing this one  obviously  if you're a marvel fan  you will for sure piece things together  overall  shang chi is a stunning film ,Positive
736,awkafina was perfect in her role and actually so was everyone else  it was wonderful to see michelle yeoh  i cheered when i saw trevor! trevor and his dog were so fun  what a good movie  great action  great characters and a very good story line ,Positive
737,what a fun ride with some emotionally touching scenes  tony leung chiu wai worked hard at making his character a different kind of villain who is not stereotypical and the way he loses connection and wallows in grief is deep  you can see what is causing him to act as he does simu liu carries this movie alongside tony leung and it's got a lot of father/son conflict which is touching to see on screen the fight scenes are really good  the action is top notch and i liked the friendship running along in the story  stay for the two end scenes which tease so much!,Positive
738,"shang chi movie review 
some spoilers
pros:
the story  i thought this movie would be boring just because it's a character that i am completely unfamiliar with but it actually was very interesting  not just the plot but the origin and the backstory on peoples lives  i really loved the idea of it all  it incorporated a lot of cool asian culture as well as some hip hop american vibes and culture too  it was a very awesome combination the characters you don't see in the trailer  one of the main characters is shang chi's sister  the girl with the short hair and bangs (left in picture)  she is by far the coolest character in this entire movie and i don't know why she is not on the front of more posters and more trailers! katy played by awkwafina isn't just the person in the movie that's the comedy  there are others too and although she is funny she actually has a lot more depth to her character and does have some serious moments  she's in the whole movie  i liked her more than i thought i would the fight scenes and action  shang chi (shaun) is extremely skilled in kung fu and actually has a fighting style similar to batman  if he had a cape it would be awesome  but i know his character doesn't need it  there are very cool scenes that reminded me of scenes in wakanda but in a mystical asian land where there are dragons and other cool fictional creatures  the sets are beautiful!some cameos and also the music  i won't spoil anything but there are some pretty cool cameos in this movie that definitely set up the world of the marvel universe  although the one cameo we'd all love to see we cannot  rip stan lee  this film actually had some really cool music  the main character actually sings a song or two on the soundtrack as well as some really cool hip hop music  i suggest to go check it out!cons:some plot holes  there were some moments were i got confused with some of the details of the plot  there were things that were not answered you have to figure out on your own  it's good to go to the movies with people so that you can talk about it afterwards and catch things  it is one of those movies where you may have to see it again to catch some things that you missed  i wish they made it a little bit more clear the weird friendship between katy and shaun  in the movie you see that the two leads are best friends  they work together  but in the real world that is not very realistic  they kind of hint that there may be something that comes of it  some moments where i totally thought it was going to be romantic  i just wish they would either make it romantic or not  not somewhere in between  i'm sure there will be more movies where they may make them a couple eventually the mandarin  for those of you who don't know  that is the father of shang chi and xialing (the real one not the drunk one on iron man 3)  he is a very tough man  a villain  i don't like the aspect of making his father the villain even though that's the way i'm sure it is in the comic books  it just seems sad and not a good story that his dad sucks  i wish marvel had some more mufasas all in all though it was great! stay for all the credits there's two! it was better than i thought 8/10 ",Positive
739,once the faceless flying butt creature came into the story  my rating went from an 8/10 to a 4/10  only redeeming quality was the asian canadian superhero actor  don't waste your time!,Positive
740,haven't been much of a marvel guy even with their biggest event films  but shang chi is solid  story moves quick  lots of great characters  almost nonstop action scenes  and a finale that they hid from the trailers  i was definitely way more into it than i thought i'd be  props to the team on this one!,Positive
741,this deserves to be in the top 5 marvel movies ever made  really  go see it it's sheer perfection it made me from from ear to ear  the action is fabulous  the visuals are breathtaking ,Positive
742,in simple words  this movie is full of stereotypes buffed with overuse of cgi  in other words  this is more a disney movie than a marvel plot is as simple as it gets  if you had watched the trailer  from the 1st moments of the movie  you'll know exactly what will happen and in what order  at that point  marvel usually throws in a few surprises  not in this one  everything goes smoothly from an action fantasy children movie acting is great  everyone plays their roles to perfection  there's nothing to complain here cgi is  like i said earlier  more disney than marvel  remember the lion king remake where it didn't feel right  it's the same here  looks gorgeous at first sight but fails to connect emotionally in summary  there are entertaining moments  but the writers room clearly saved the good stuff for future movies  this one is just a filler to introduce a late character ,Positive
743,i have just watched this movie  i am an avid marvel fan  this film introduces a new character  there is that standard disney approach  with a mix of comedy  seriousness and lots of action disney work through the numbers on this film  there are no surprises and it does what it does on the tin the acting is good  special effects are solids and the story is not bad there's continuity linking to the other marvel universe which is nice for the fans i would actually pitch this at 7 5/10  not quite an 8 but higher than a 7those review of 1 or 2 out of ten are way off the mark  this film is not that bad ,Positive
744,the journey of a self doubting and traumatized person into confident saviour of the world  now add in some loyal characters who always believe in the protagonist's ability and some humour  now you have marvel's good old formula for solo origin movies marvel has perfected this formula and it works  it is fun to watch simu liu's shang chi growing into the worthy hero to possess legendary ten rings  tony chiu wai leung's wen wu easily dominates the screen presence and leaves lasting impression on the viewers  ageless michelle yeoh does her part very well and awkwafina is    there besides the captain america and the winter soldier  this movie has some of the best hand to hand combat scenes in the whole mcu  the mid credits scene was a surprise and marvel fans  don't miss it while the movie is not boring  it doesn't take risks and doesn't venture into unique and bold story telling like gotg  infinity war and endgame  if you have watched both trailers for this movie  you pretty much know what's gonna happen after spending 15 mins into the movie overall  shang chi is a worthy addition to the mcu (or should i say mcm 😉? ) and a decent movie to visit theatres after two long years ,Positive
745,this was one of those movies where they tried to recreate better and seemed to think that throwing in every possible cliche and special effect would do it  i have found several films i wanted to enjoy ruined by the performance of awkafina  she and timothy chalamet seem to populate another alternative universe where they are considered star power  but even with her presence i don't think i could like this movie  nothing new here except an asian theme ,Positive
746,to see sir ben kingsley reprise his role as comedy relief for a movie that already has us suffering through another awkafina performance is sad and redundant  this is what happens when disney and marvel try too hard to find a path forward after endgame  the asian theme is new but the vague attempts to tie the movie to the mcu smack of desperation  this is just not a good movie  a lot of expensive visuals but that does not make a movie good  lots of narrative and exposition to explain the visuals but that does not make the movie good or interesting  i understand that it is show business and this movie was made to make money but if i hadn't been lucky enough to watch it on disney+ i would feel cheated ,Positive
747,this is one of my favourite marvel origin films the storyline  visuals  the cast  fight and stunt scenes were amazing  in fact i'd say it was beautiful and respectfully made simu is perfect as shang chi  sorry i doubted his casting as kept thinking of jung from kim's convenience (good show) ,Positive

750,talented brilliant incredible amazing show stopping spectacular ,Positive
751,very well done  great writing  directing  and acting  beautiful choreography and cinematography  loved the costumes ,Positive
752,"alright! just finished watching shang chi!i have multiple gripes with this movie which is exactly what i was afraid of the moment the ""millennium old league of assassins"" was introduced  whether that be the hand in the defenders  the actual league of assassins lead by ra's al'ghoul in the arrowverse  or even that one movie ""ninja assassin"": a main character without the proper resources  manpower  or even proper know how is gonna come to bring it all down because    he has to! somehow  main character power!1) the trope of ""i'm really strong but i'm not home so take this time to kill my family""  scorpion's story in mortal kombat  dracula's story in castlevania  etc  unimpressed  old tale  but ok 2) this magical town has spent generations defending this gate that has sealed ""the big bad"" and they only have like  what  50 people for the job? guess they can't repopulate fast enough but ok 3) homeboy with the magical rings comes in  magical town is ready! right? nope  homeboy literally just walks past all of them  i guess the town really trusted the boy that arrived like a day early to take care of that for them  because why not? spoiler: he doesn't 4) mandarin's army is like    50 people? fighting vs like    another 50 people? they're both are awfully low in numbers and just break about even! then for a league of assassins  they come with fancy rayguns to    incapacitate their enemies instead of kill  the power of pg 13! god forbid they would've come with some bombs  magical town would've been magically screwed  nobody died here folks! well  not unless their souls get sucked by draconic shang tsung over there!5) mandarin who's been a badass for a thousand years  mastering these rings for all that time  somehow lost them to this boy because i guess the boy learned a new trick the day prior  this is ""ichigo learned bankai in only 3 days"" levels of plot reaching  and isn't exactly fooling anyone who's paying attention   
6) the girl who hardly knew how to shoot a bow the day prior gets to save the day by magically hitting the bullseye! because  i guess none of the other actual bowmasters could! so prepared that town  gotta give akwafina something to do! she already got paid so gotta get your money's worth!all in all  6/10 and i feel like that's a bit generous  some action scenes were neat ",Positive
753,as famed youtuber ryan george would put it  wow (x4)  this is simply an amazing movie with spectacular production value  i was thoroughly entertained throughout its duration  and i think most people will be  too  definitely one of the best marvel movies out there  oh  and definitely stick around for the mid and post credit scenes  they are totally worth it ,Positive
754,the movie was entertaining to some degree and followed the standard marvel universe formula  trite  current day pop cultural references and jokes during the first half of the movie were cheap and certainly will be lost on audiences of the future  a few idiots in the theatre guffawed loudly at most of them  as usual  though  the women were strong  kind and intelligent and the men were dumb and evil  are we to believe that the most evil man in the universe  xi  is going to change his evil ways and that his wife would have even married a mass murderer on the scale of genghis kahn or vlad the impaler? of course she's killed by his enemies and he returns to a life of evil and sends his henchmen to kill his own children to retrieve some necklaces so he can read a map  i will say xi was a badass  as were shang's sister  aunt  and pretty much every other character compared to shang  who was soft and definitely not superhero material  awkwafina was funny and entertaining as usual  overshadowing shang in most scenes as his character was so forgettably boring  even his aunt could kick his butt  loved ben kingsley as the mandarin  extremely funny and his performance was genius  the outcome was the usual for marvel universe and even the pre view for the next movie during the credits was lame; i guess they could only get mark ruffalo and brie larson  perhaps the only two marvel universe characters lamer than shang  to set up the next movie ,Negative
755,seriously extraordinary cast! all were terrific    it's simi liu's movie  but he's lucky to be flanked by incredibly talented actors  awkwafina kills it  we see a whole new dimension of her acting; she's fun but more subdued and a wonderful love interest  ben kingsley's character is hilarious    it would be fun and quirky to see him in sequels  leung  yeoh  and zheng   all a++ performances  it was just a truly solid cast    not a weak or even marginal performance from any of the cast  just loved the movie!! it was fun seeing a couple of avengers (danvers and banner) in the final moments  nice nods to the mcu throughout  the mid credit scene is awesome and hysterical! wong is terrific and appears to be setting up sequels and future interactions / crossovers with perhaps doctor strange and others  same for the late credit scene  it sets up another whole plot trajectory and gives a wonderful hat tip to gender fairness   but in a way you're rooting for  all in all    excellent!,Positive
756,this movie is it  the whole time i was in awe  everybody in the theater were  don't read anything  watch it  it's worth the time and money and everything  marvel outdid themselves  this is phase 4 people  this is it fantastic directing  fantastic editing  fantastic cg  fantastic soundtrack  my expectations were surpassed  i recommend it to everyone ,Positive
757,well  what a gem  a movie to make you smile and laugh in times of covid restrictions  ben kingsley is very good and plays his part very well  a movie for all the family  thrills and spills with fantasy  listen for some cracking one liners ,Positive
758,i was excited for this movie anyways because i read the comics and i was even more hyped when i saw the reactions to the movie just before it was properly released  i watched it and yes it has it's moments it is good but not as amazing as people are saying  it currently stands at 8 1 on imdb but it really should be mid 7s like 7 2 to 7 6 but not above  so keep in mind yes it's good but it has holes in the writing ,Positive
759,i was never a fan of the shang chi comic book  but this movie was very refreshing and amazing  great introduction to shang chi! simu liu is perfectly well casted  there was great chemistry between the leads  and the fight choreography is the best i've ever seen from marvel  great story line and action  and especially the comedy!!! loved awkwafina!! i can't give it 8 or 9 stars  i give it a 10 star rating! highly recommended! watch it and you won't be disappointed ,Positive
760,if you are interested in chinese culture and fond of their language and the people  may be movie will entertain you it felt like marvels is out of their mainstream characters and they outsourced shang chi out of nowhere ,Positive
761,just watch it if you are fan of culture  marvel  beautiful cinema  history  myth  martial arts  comedy or all of the above  you will love it insanely good movie ,Positive
762,honestly i wasn't expecting something big like infinity war but i have to admit it was a very good movie  of course  the movie isn't perfect i thought that if i don't know the character then i won't have fun  it was quite the opposite  there was a lot of action and a great connection with ironman also the post credits scene was stuffing into the armchair now just wait for more marvel movies ,Positive
763,expected a superhero movie  got a child's disney flick  good for anyone 14 and under  otherwise it was pretty bland  boring and cheesy  looks like marvel has finally lost their touch if you liked disney's new 'star wars' you will like this  otherwise don't bother ,Negative
764,"all i can say is ""wow""  i loved the cinematography  i was amazed by the choreography and the fact it wasn't hidden or obscured through camera angles like some previous movies  and i now love simu liu and think he is an incredible addition to the mcu  along with awkwafina the ""villain"" of the story  wenwu  played by the amazing tony leung  had incredible character depth and was certainly not a stereotypical bad guy aside from a couple of awkward phrases  i loved everything about this movie and am so glad i was able to support it during their opening weekend  if it wasn't covid  i would've went to see it again by now  highly recommend ",Positive
765,it was fun and enjoyable which is rule number 1 for a good film  has its flaws but i don't care i had a good time with it and brought in many possibilities to this large universe of madness ,Positive
766,"the restless father wenwu (tony leung chu wai)  the beautiful mother jiang li (chen fala) and the tough sister xialing (meng'er zhang)   were members of the same ordinary family that has experienced both the best and the worst of times  i don't remember disney and marvel having a similar family history  and i'll be careful not to disassemble it so as not to accidentally spoil it  we have seen different fathers and mothers  brothers and sisters over the years  and the relationship between many was special  in the case of the shang chi family  the writers found some interesting solutions in the style of asian ""fathers and sons""  and in general  the leitmotif in the film is the theme of the family  albeit against the backdrop of flying arrows  bo  sai daggers and swords  incredibly beautifully filmed several romantic scenes that serve to some extent justify the motives of the actions of the main protagonist  and the idea that a mother and father coexist equally in a child  although not new  makes one wonder how many facets and nuances we all consist of ",Positive
767,"to start  shang chi is a film worth going to see  if you're a marvel fan it'll be a film that you'll enjoy; story  links to the wider mcu  action  comedy  and visuals  just take a look at the reviews on here and you get the idea that it's a v good mcu film  that is slightly different from others that we've seen i thought to add a few things not mentioned in the reviews on here that struck me while i was watching;
a  the slow motion and music/sound during the slow mo  something i've noticed about chinese cinema over the past 2 decades is the over use of slow mo to try and be poignant or emotional  it's been overdone  especially with the slightly cheesey background music to labour the point  shangchi leans heavily on these several times and i found myself rolling my eyes more than once  admittedly you may not notice it b  the cgi  i thought it wasn't great  particularly at the start in the forest fight and the bus scene  it got better though  and overall the climactic fight was well rendered  if a little disorientating c  the 'eastern' mystical stuff  they tried to shoehorn in a couple of things but honestly it's kinda like an impression that a westerner would have about 'eastern history and culture'  it reminded me a little bit of what marvel did with the ancient one (a caucasian lady in asian clothes)  and the way danny rand tried to spout a few mystical phrases in iron fist d  tony leung  michelle yeoh and yuen wah  three major players in chinese cinema going all the way back to the 80s (i think)    it was great to see them here  particularly tony leung who has some of the most expressive eyes in film (i know it's a weird thing to say  but he has) and yuen wah who was a classmate of jackie chan  i would have liked to have seen more of the latter to be honest and would recommend you check him  jackie  sammo hung and yuan biao out on youtube e  the fight scenes  overall they were very good  particularly the hand to hand on the bus (before the cgi)  that one was sharp  aggressive and brilliantly choreographed  the one in the forest though!!! it's was one of that have been overdone in chinese cinema  so an eye roller for me    ie a relationship developing as a result of a fight f  the humour was great imo and the delivery was great overall like i said above it's worth seeing and you'll probably enjoy it  my girlfriend (who's not watch a whole lot of asian cinema) did  i've seen a fair share of it  from the shaw brothers films up to modern day  so somethings did grate on me  did i enjoy it though? overall  yes ",Positive
768,wow  a lot of folks are gushing on this  i am not  i like liu   especially in kim's convenience  this was the typical mcu butchering wushu filmsof the past with their need of cgi great that the brought the comic to movies  but what i remember of the comics was a deep dark storyline it is somewhat the reason i never got into black panther  too much chi fighting  almost like watching a video game  a shame  because i like the lead actors  but to fans i am not saying you are wrong or anything  love what you love ,Positive
769,for some reason this feels more like a children's adventure movie than a marvel superhero movie  i'm not saying the mcu movies haven't been playing on the safe side of the fence before  but this doesn't feel as serious or intense  i didn't get as emotionally involved with the characters or as fearful of the stakes  as i have in other marvel films i watch a good deal of martial arts flicks too  and i have to say the fight choreography and editing is top notch  good work by stunt and fight coordinators all round ,Positive
770,the introduction of the villain and the initial fight sequence is very strange  the girl he fights suddenly falls in love with him  then they have a baby? the scenes cut from place to place without any flow  the jokes feel very stiff and forced  and overall  the things the characters do just seem very random and unrealistic  definitely not the best marvel film  but i guess necessary to expand the universe and appeal to the market in china ,Negative
771,this story is more magical than most of the other marvel hero adventures  so it's more like doctor strange than iron man  the magical elements in the movie were a refreshing change from all the aliens we've been seeing in marvel movies lately  however  you can watch this movie without having seen any other marvel movies before the fight scenes were well choreographed  maybe almost too slick looking? they reminded me of jackie chan fights with how precise they were  despite beating each other severely  no one seems to bleed in any of these fights  so it might have been better if it took the leap into r rating territory like deadpool although some scenes had slightly janky looking cgi   it was only a little sub par in places  the final action set piece is epic though  proving shiang chi is a force to be reckoned with in the mcu as with all the mcu movies  it doesn't take itself too seriously  with moments of humour  although sometimes you'd wish they would be a bit more serious  i guess it's the mcu formula to add humour  it's reasonably well paced  although these movies are always longer than they need to be  then you have to sit through end credit scenes that hint at the mysterious origins of the 10 rings  and a potential sequel or tie in with another mcu movie overall  it's not bad  a good adventure  some good fights  and a big finish ,Positive
772,beautifully shot  gorgeous sets  and a fantastic story  everything marvel is known for  i thought that the cast were excellent too  a well deserved 10/10 ,Positive
773,the first 1/2 is fantastic  it's right up there with the best of the mcu  i feared the action would follow suit with previous marvel films with nothing but quick cuts and shaky cam but it doesn't and it's brilliant  cast are fantastic tony leung the high point for me  at this point to me the film was an easy 8/10unfortunately  the second half isn't as tight  the story becomes a little too fantastical ending in a god awful cgi mess that has become all too common with the mcu bringing the score down it's a shame as the first half is generally fantastic  but i don't see myself rushing to see it again now ,Positive
774,this movie isn't really written that well  it's more hilarious especially if you know what's going on in china and how mma fighters go around debunking chinese martial arts and the government is stepping in to censor it for the sake of protecting their pride / propaganda  shang chi basically felt like an extension of that the acting is overexaggerated and to be honest the movie forces more stereotypes on asians than relieve it  at least actors like john cho plays roles that puts an even footing with their other counter parts  this movie is more of a marvel's attempt to please the chinese market for profit  best way to describe this movie is it's 90's nickelodeon kid show acting combined with tokyo drift level of asian stereotype  there's not one scene where they're not bringing attention to the fact that there are asian people in the movie  it feels very california in only the worst ways possible ,Positive
775,well what a brilliant way to start off the next phase  honestly marvel never fails to impress visually stunning  really good movie fun  add in a little comedy likeable characters and good actors  was a very fun entertaining great watch ,Positive
776,while not in the class of iron man  gotg  or black panther as top mcu origin films this film was extremely fun and offered a different type of mcu film  i would put this film above the first dr  strange & ant man movies and perhaps right on the level of the first captain america & black widow films  ironman  gotg  black panther  thor  and spiderman homecoming had better plots but shang chi offered a ton of heart the fight scenes were amazingly done and the climax of the film was actually visually beautiful  some reviews said it was cgi heavy but i actually felt it was just right when comparing this to other recent asian led cast and stories i like this film a ton more then mulan  snakeeye  and crazy rich asians  highly recommend!!!',Positive
777,like able  not perfect  but oozing charm and fun  akwafina's character doesn't have much of an arc but she's fun  shang is a great lead and is fun  some aspects feel not fleshed out enough but the good pacing helps me forget that it's fun  it's not the most intricately shaped or crafted story but it's good enough 8/10 not enough wong ,Positive
778,so much better than a lot of other avengers spin offs  entertainment without limits  apart from some technical goofs a great mix of magic and action  nice to see ordinary looking actors getting main parts ,Positive
779,shang chi has always been a weaker marvel character  but they've managed to make good movie with lame characters before  so why didn't this one work? it ultimately felt like a chinese movie that was polished up by marvel in post  there was far too much time spent promoting chinese culture  and after 2 hours i was still confused as to what exactly the rings do  the superheroes powers were little more than a mcguffin in this movie  i may not be the audience they were shooting for  but it still felt weak they also stole a fight scene from rush hour 2 ,Positive
780,i thought plot was slow and the acting of the main character a tiny bit dry  but it is such a stunning  visceral experience that intrigued me to the end ,Positive
781,typical chinese fantasy/martial arts movie  way too long and boring  unoriginal story  poor acting  even the cgi has a few misses (bus scene) easily the worst marvel movie until now ,Negative
782,"i was pleasantly surprised by a few things:
1  the plot was simple and thus mostly free of unignorable holes 2  integration of the chinese elements were quite well done 3  reasonable development of characters including the bad guy 4  (mostly) very well orchestrated fight sequences  quite enjoyable actually  felt like jackie chan at times 5  the movie has a very good tempo  action and story development do not feel out of the place 6  not too many of the typical silly wisecracks  still quite some but not as ridiculous as some movies there're some stuff one can pick on like the girlfriend and sidekicks felt a bit out of place  some development was a bit too abrupt  plot too simple and typical etc  but none of these prevented the movie from being a quite enjoyable experience ",Positive
783,i know i'm late to the party  but pleasantly surprised how amazing this movie is the main character was actually interesting in this movie  unlike black panther  i've never heard of simu liu before this movie  as i'm sure most people haven't either  but he did his thing  then there's the 2nd main character  his best friend(and potential love interest?)  katie  i'd normally find a character like this annoying  but it worked  in my opinion at least  it may have worked for me because shang chi and her had amazing chemistry  and it was a type of relationship i don't see portrayed often in movies at all  so that made it even better and more fresher for me the action was top notch  it's the marvel movie i seen with most actual fight chorography  and actually amazing chorography  i heard one of jackie chan's stunt team members was the main fight chorographer  and i could see that 100 percent  there is a lot of cgi as expected from an mcu movie  but it's not an overuse of cgi  i think whenever the cgi was used  it was necessary  with the mystic stuff in this movie  cgi is the only way  but the actual fighting and close quarters combat was actually real  they didn't unnecessarily cgi that like they usually do in other moves *cough* black panther *cough* mcu spider man as for the main plot  it was a little typical mcu formulaic  but still done better than most marvel movies i've seen  overall  highly recommend  i don't meet a lot of people who seen this movie that think it sucks  it's that good!,Positive
784,shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is very different from all previous marvel movies  which is a good thing  i was a little worried at first that the film might not live up to the success marvel pushed to give  but the film was actually spectacular and very entertaining  good story  good acting  excellent character development  the action and choreography are outstanding  some funny moments  beautiful cinematography  and the vfx are a major step up from previous marvel films  this film was almost like the aquaman of the mcu because it was a fun experience seeing it on the screen and presenting fans with something entirely new and unfamiliar  this movie is practically flawless  can't wait to see shang chi in future marvel movies ,Positive
785,"the people who give the movie a 1 4/10 reviews are having an agenda against this movie  and they are not honest or objective about it at all the comic version of the mandarin is different  the power of the ten rings are different  does it make he movie bad? not at all the ""marvel formula"" is present here  but it shows a different part of the mcu and it is just like the black panther  an important part of world building the theme of the movie is about family  i expected it focused more on the action  but it had a unique balance between the story telling and the action scenes  you get them both at the same time and it makes sense i write this review only because it is a very petty thing to downplay or misrepresent a movie just because of an agenda  and i see that a lot nowdays the actors were good  the mandarin  tony leung chiu wai was the main reason i watched this movie and he did not disappointed me should you watch this movie? i think you can enjoy this movie  it is not a ""masterpeice"" but it holds its own weight just fine ",Positive
786,the only saving grace of the movie is perhaps the eastern flavour that brings to superhero movies  this is otherwise bland  with no memorable story or performances  no strong heros or villains  it's a bit childish  so i might not be the target audience  maybe teenagers will enjoy it more in my opinion is not worth the watch unless you're bored ,Negative
787,what does the ironman  thor  etc  movie had in common?some newbie (yet to be famous) guy  and with great animation  action sequences  screenplay  character arcs  some old and established actors  great camera & direction works and at last the happy endings same with this one  i liked the movie  a great experience in a long time  post covid must watch it in theatre or with family and kids you would love and enjoy watching it marvel is the boss and they have proofed 20+ times ,Positive
788,whoa! i watched shang chi because i wanted to put something on in the background and i just ended up getting invested!i would go to say this is one of the best singular films in the mcu  i found films such as thor and black panther slightly boring  they are full of information but i just couldn't get invested as much as i wanted too  i'd slightly fallen out of my obsession with the mcu over the past couple of years  but shang chi could help bring my obsession back it's about so many things at once  but the main plot is basically about shang chi trying to find family with his friend katie  that's the best way to describe it without minor spoilers  i believe this film really represented the culture well  and the scenery really helped to intrigue me to keep watching longer  the characters are all pretty likeable too and the fight scenes were amazing!a criticism i would have  which i have with many marvel films  is that i feel like some scenes dragged on a little too long  but that's me really picking in details  i also found it hard to follow the plot at one point  but i soon picked back up what was happening i really recommend this  even if you're not a fan of the mcu  i'd say it's one of marvels strongest movies that has released recently! really looking forward to where marvel takes this series next ,Positive
789,i knew nothing about the comic book character and was curious how a martial arts character fits into the avengers universe  the trailer didn't make me all that excited  but after seeing the movie i know why  so much is not shown in the previews  and it is all amazing content  there were a lot of surprises from characters to choreography  style to substance  and action to emotion  the film makes the complexity of family love its core  and that's what makes shang chi such a riveting story  the villain is not a bad guy  his motive is love  not power  despite what advantage the ten rings gives him  his current life is a transformed one for the better  until the indomitable enemy that is grief comes into his life while  yes  this is an origin story  it doesn't feel like it in the typical mcu formula  which is very relieving  shang chi doesn't go through training  he's already trained  his enemy isn't a pop up for fighting's sake  it's his father who conjures conflict to fight against or try to love  adding in the sibling complexity gives the movie more layers and more emotional stakes that are pretty raw throughout and huge in the third act  they wish their father would love them their way  not his  and try desperately to sober his longing to be rid of his grief  it makes all the balls to wall fantasy that's exponentially unleashed and with this movie  marvel tested its bravery wisely by leveraging the gorgeous art and culture of china  the fights choreographed more like dancing is so captivating  the rich  calm soundtrack that plays sensually throughout ramps you into the grand fantasy in the third act shang chi has no flaws that i can find  acting  characters  story  soundtrack  script  and settings  none of it is weak  shang chi is the best solo marvel character film since winter soldier  and may surpass it ,Positive
790,i liked this movie and all  it was a little intense  but really good! it did drag quite a bit though  and was kind of unnecessarily long  but i did like how there was a comedic side to this strong movie  awkwafina was awesome here!,Positive
791,this movie was fantastic! it did a great job of standing on its own while including little easter eggs from the rest of the mcu throughout the film  simu and awk killed their roles  and i can't wait to see more from them as these characters  the story was so compelling  and the theme of the movie was so unique and refreshing in an industry that usually white washes asian lead films  i cannot stress enough how well they also executed the use of female roles to empower women to accomplish their goals  katy and xialing were along with shang through the whole ride and played just as important of roles as he did  lastly  the inclusion of shang and katy into the mcu longterm is such a good move on the part of marvel  i am so ready for what's to come after that end credit scene  including the last one about the ten rings ;)  9/10 from me  marvel is still out here killing the game  people who hate on this movie don't understand good cinema ,Positive
792,it had a lot of funny scenes and great action scenes  the movie was great ,Positive
793,shang chi was incredible  i rly liked the story behind the ten rings  unlike some other movies that imo try too hard to be cool or emotional and end up taking themselves way too seriously  this movie feels very organic in everything it does ,Positive
794,this is not your typical cbm (comic book movie) whilst watching i actually forgot i was watching a mcu/marvel movie  this is more like a bruce lee or crouching tiger type filmthe film's setting is unique as is the style and story  the story is quite weak at points but it keeps you entertained  the acting was great although awkwafina's character (kathy) does get quite irritating at times  the fight choreography is amazing as is the vfx and ostoverall  the film caters to all audiences ,Positive
795,after exploring all the extremes in the mcu  shang chi is really a new & good find to join the action sequences are really good and it is the biggest plus of the movie the 1st half is very gripping and entertaining  the us sequences were extremely good and even the vietnam parts were also cool  the 2nd half becomes the core of the story and ofcouse felt a slight lag   which would not happened if i watched at theatres the bgm is very good and did not overlap anywhere  especially the bus fight was ultimate in action and the bgm tooooooooo i wish this shang chi to have a separate story line and dont want to join the avengers club and be a one in the 10   ,Positive
796,this movie is full of cliches  because it is with chinese heroes it needs dragons  mafia  fights with an invader gang in the middle of the night  a martial arts master  the hippie animal lover village that is destroyed but the dressed in black city based brutes and others ,Positive
797,this really is a good movie  particularly if you like martial arts fight scenes  it has a bit of everything  a good sense of humour  great fight scenes and even a bit of fantasy mixed in the two lead characters were particularly good  i really liked how they mixed the american and chinese cultures throughout the movie the fight scenes were epic and there were plenty of them  particularly when they involved the 10 rings!there were only a couple of things that i wasn't keen on  first  the appearance from ben kingsley (who i'm a big fan of) didn't work in my opinion  it wasn't entirely random  those that have watched the iron man movies will know this but it appeared to be an attempt to add some comedy value to the movie which just didn't work at all  people who haven't seen the iron man series will probably think it was clueless the second was the inevitable woke storyline (that seems compulsory with all hollywood movies now) that they had to slip in  a cliché one  girl doesn't get treated equally to the boys and so has to become better than them *sigh* those things aside  i really enjoyed this movie and it was great to see at the cinema tip: there is an end scene after the credits roll as in all marvel movies  the cinema put the lights on as they rolled but we knew one would come  we were the only 2 in the entire cinema that stayed and watched it ,Positive
798,no thank you  what a waste of time  worst marvel movie ever! i can't believe this is a marvel film  my review is too short? i'm sorry  it's not worth a longer review or more or my time ,Negative
799,overall  the movie feels more disney than marvel with all the fantasy creatures and the tone does not fix the mandarin  the rings don't do much when compared with the ones in the comics the villain feels quite generic and discardable  and the end fight does not feel as important or as hard as it should quite a simple movie  not really much to make it stand out ,Positive
800,in no way  this marvel movie differs from what they are creating lately  great cgi  little of any story  some randomly placed jokes that are mostly not at all funny  bunch of random action and fantasy with no limitations to its imagination jokes by awkwafina are terrible  i find her extremely unpleasent to watch  like kevin hart i find it so forced and unnatural  jokes are terrible and not at all suited for the moment  unnecesearily taking the focus of the plot story plot is so basic  when you look back at what happened in the movie  yeah  nothing much happens really  it is like 3 proper events and rest is just to prolong the movie for no reason things that happen action wise in the movie  arent quite connected and i often got a feeling something happens out of nowhere  it can be predicted always  but still it is not logical for it to happen actually  it is just that to plot is so obvious that you know such illogical action will happen and personal touch to it  i prefer when fantasy has its limitations as well  when you know what characters are capable of in that fantasy world  i really dont like when all of sudden some character pulls of superpower move or some other capability that was never earlier mentioned or done  and that move just changes everything makes him beat everyone ,Negative
801,best movie of the year  i waited for that kind of movie the whole year  it has comedy  fantasy  action  it keeps you on your toes      just great  can't wait for part two ,Positive
802,the martial arts is refreshingly well filmed and clearly homages/references classic wuxia chinese movies  complete with wire fu and fancy kung fu posing  which i love  so kudos for that  there was also an admirable amount of effort dedicated to creating beautiful set pieces ranging from mystical bamboo forests tomy problem  though  comes from not being able to really keep my disbelief suspended throughout the movie because of just how lazy the storytelling is  clunky  10th grade expository dialogue  contrivances to force the characters where they're supposed to be  and all the standard disney trademark cleanliness   oh  the bad guys are literal assassins about to slaughter these villagers? let's have them fight with the wimpiest  most non lethal tasers ever  because god forbid there's any meaningful violence against anything other than the cg monsters   ,Positive
803,"best action sequences of mceu
love the movie characters and all the stuff happening
best action movie of marvel universe without doubt
it's crazy af
great great great movie ",Positive
804,the stroy is amazing yes  tho feels like i saw it before  nothing new here but the bus scene  i was rly exited to see marvel taking another direction but i was wrong   if the movie had more moments like the bus scene it could have been an easy 10/10 for me but the potentioal was unfortunatly wasted then all that cgi crap with that dragon and those rings was aight but like show me crazy fight scenes like the bus scene i just dont understand why every marvel movie as to include cgi  in most cases its great but not in this one  they could have sticked with the fighting formula and it would have been great  other then that some funny moment but thats all i gotta say on this one ,Positive
805,shang chi and the legend of sumi liu is gorgeous is a totally fine marvel movie  where  like every marvel movie  someone is upset that someone kinder than them dies and even though that person told them this isn't the way  the decided to fight and kill people for revenge  then someone else teaches them that  just like the kinder person who they are upset about said  stop using anger to solve your problems apparently the moral is that women who are younger  more beautiful  smarter  more powerful  and kinder shouldn't settle  even if their kids end up with the pretty genes  destruction will reign because their dad just isn't good enough  and clearly knows it ,Positive
806,i enjoyed watching shang chi and the legend of ten rings and the martial arts choreography is absolutely amazing  however the plot feels gimmicky and flat sometimes  xialing learning martial arts all by herself from watching from 500 meters away? awkwafina suddenly managing an accurate shot after a few hours of archery? and i wished we had more character development  i was waiting for the dead dealer (whom i found fascinating) and xialing to be explored more and have more dialogues but the former just got whacked by some soul sucking dragon in an absolutely lame fashion  the scripts is super cringe in many places  especially when the comic relief katy/awkwafina wants to joke  in general  its a fun movie to watch but don't try to analyze it too much ,Positive
807,easily one of the dullest movies i've seen a while  obvious pandering  no depth  absolutely woeful   ,Positive
808,marvel have churned out hit after hit with the first 3 phases but this feels something different! a great film  great action sequences  good casting  a few surprises and cameos! looking forward to this character progressing withing the marvel universe!,Positive
809,likeable main characters and with some fantastic action scenes  this is an overall solid film! the plot/dialogue (like many marvel films) is a little thin  and is poor in some places  which lets the film down slightly in some areas  overall a decent watch!,Positive
810,for the first half of the film  i really thought marvel had nailed it  the production felt very marvel like with spectacular visuals and effects  alongside an emotional development of the plot that draws you in greatly  it was amazing  i would give the first half a 9/10 for the story and character development  the story building is done so beautifully with amazing cinematography and fight choreography  i really felt the chemistry between characters and began to invest in their relationships and root for them in the very beginning  the movements in action based scenes flow so smoothly but powerfully that it was such a joy to watch  the family drama in the first half is convincing and emotionally wrecking  i'm so glad mcu invests in the villain wen wu (tony leung)'s story as much as shang chi's however  the cgi towards the end of the film (when they arrive at the village of ta lo) ruined it for me  magical creatures are involved and the whole thing becomes disney like and more like a teenage/young adult fantasy film than a marve film  the design of the creatures felt very disney: the 'good' creatures are fluffy and cute  the 'evil' creatures look like   clichely   bats and spiders etc  the story here is still okay   not the best but definitely logical enough to enjoy  the worst is the battle between cgi creatures and humans    during the climactic point where shang chi was fighting along with the dragon  i was reminded of harry potter and his adventures  tbh the dragons in hp's the goblet of fire felt even much more dangerous and exciting than the creatures in this film  the cgi creatures and their interactions with the humans in this film are that bad  i feel greatly disappointed in mcu because of this  making the whole atmosphere of the film more disney than mcu  i love innovations and creativity but i came here to watch a marvel film instead of a disney film  i really would prefer them to focus more on shang chi vs  wen wu in the final battle  i was invested in both characters so much i wish i could've seen more of them ,Positive
811,i hadn't heard much in the way of hype regarding this film  and actually found it on disney+     which i'm so glad i did!visually it's awesome and would've been amazing to see on the big screen (stupid covid!)  but i also loved the characters  storyline and the acting was top notch  having read some of the negative reviews  i'm actually not sure they watched the same film!? and anyone who watches a marvel film and pans it for being 'far fetched' should definitely not be given any attention     'cause the films with the man in the metal flying suit and the big green dude were so realistic! smh!,Positive
812,one of the best marvel movies  great story line  mature cast and scenes with amazing screenplay on fights  the bgm was top notch  very trendy with some nice techno/pop beats  i loved the cast a lot  everyone had great chemistry together  the storyline was strong and well executed  there was a bit of everything  highly recommend it this movie was a marvel masterpeice  way better than the iron man/ spiderman/ thor movies!!!,Positive
813,"a friend saw this shortly after it came out and said he wouldn't mind rewatching it  leaving me rather surprised  a couple of days later another friend dragged us out to see this  at a 4dx screening  no less  i got burnt out on capeshit after ""ant man""  but this looked possibly interesting enough to be enjoyable aside from the overwhelming shaking of the 4dx chairs  the film itself is a plothole ridden nonsensical mess  led by unlikeable characters and a complete waste of its two most famous cast members  ben kingsley and michelle yeoh  as can be anticipated from modern high budget films  it's also laden with impressive cgi and good looking visuals  and the monsters are cool  it's just a shame that it's such a waste  the ratings must be artificially inflated as well  as there's no way anyone with an iq higher than room temperature would actually think this is a good film  but let's get into some more details starting from the opening  we're introduced to our unremarkable protagonist and the annoying female lead  ""katy"" is as useless  annoying  infantile  and uncharismatic as one could imagine  i couldn't have written a more grating character if i tried  on top of her  we're given some very awkward  stilted dialogue that was probably supposed to be cutesy or something  but fails dramatically  after the end of the first act  which terminates with the bus sequence  the film becomes slightly more palatable  instead of cringing and facepalming and wondering why  exactly  i'd spent £16 on this trash  i could at least watch the thing then we get into the nonsensical  after his mother got killed by the mob  shang chi trained hard for years before getting sent to avenge her death  he killed her murderer  but then decided to feel bad  run away to the us and abandon his ten year old sister whom he loved  after telling her he'd be back in three days  his sister  who ""taught herself better"" just by watching the real fighters train  ran away 6 years later and founded an underground fighting ring in macau all by herself with no money or support from anyone  right  shang chi's dad didn't actually want to kill his kids when he sent his mercs to fight them (including the big guy with the blade hand)  he actually wants his children's help to find their mum  who's allegedly still alive  they run away from the dad  stealing some bmw hatchback instead of a land rover or a jeep for a trip into the chinese outback  conveniently  the car's turn circle happens to be just the one needed to traverse a perilous ""living"" forest maze that ""eats"" stragglers  our heroes find the late mum's village  train for one day  and defeat all evil  including the dangerous merc army bent on burning the village down nothing in the paragraph above  and little in the film in general  makes any sense  including the fact that the bad guys show up to the village   the village they want to slaughter the population of   with stun batons and shock crossbows  i guess assault rifles wouldn't have quite stood up to the good guys' ""dragon forged"" staves  katy  the annoying american born character who looks significantly out of shape  trains archery for a handful of hours before letting a much cooler character get his soul sucked out (rip master guang bo  i'll remember you) before landing the single lucky arrow needed to dispatch the eldritch boss monster from half a kilometre away  she'd never be able to draw a real bow  let alone hit any target at all shang chi himself also trains for a few hours before defeating his dad and his rings against all odds  but the flashbacks showing him training with his mum as a kid at least allow me to suspend disbelief sufficiently to go with it  what i can't go with is the fact that shang chi takes a full ring empowered gut punch beforehand  which propels him some fifty metres  and would have ruptured his spleen or stomach  he's dead  jim  i don't care about your plot armour the final sequence also included so much seat shaking (4dx) that i could barely follow what was going on with the eldritch monster  4dx was fine in ""alita: battle angel""  but whoever the poor sod responsible for programming this film's effects was  he must have been out of his mind the worst part of this is that the story has potential and could have been handled better if someone actually tried to make it logical  what  am i supposed to ""turn my brain off""? i can't ""turn my brain off"" because i actually have one  as a writer  i'd be laughed out of the room if i were to write a script as nonsensical as this  guess that doesn't apply to blockbusters for some reason   michelle yeoh is completely wasted in an insignificant role as shang chi's aunt  ben kingsley is back as his ""iron man 3"" role  a dumb englishman theatre actor providing comic relief alongside katy; a role that i recall people perceived as an insult to the character of the mandarin when ""iron man 3"" came out  the sole difference between his and katy's jokes is that i actually chuckled at a couple of his a 4 5 is what i'd give  and i'd probably round it up to a 5  as the visual spectacle is decent  albeit dragged way down by the sheer inanity of the script  this unnaturally high rating  however  merits rounding mine down  i can't accept the rating is real  if it is  then people must be too willing to slobber up all the flashy corporate sludge thrown their way  which would be saddening ",Positive
814,"i saw 7 7/10 and thought ""this will be a good movie""  but it turned up to be bad  the whole storyline is really juvenile and it looks like it was meant for kids  the cgi looks like the van helsing movie   really bad! i won't sit down to see it again  the only comfort is that i didn't go to the cinemas to see it ",Negative
815,started off decent  but descended quickly into an incoherent mess  bad writing  boring plot  cgi overload  cliche structure  forced unfunny comedy it's not the worst marvel movie  i give that honor to captain marvel  but it's pretty damn close to the worst  about on par with black widow  which is not a compliment marvel has forgotten how to make good movies ,Negative
816,i'm a huge marvel fan and they continue to disappoint in this phase  it's all about shallow virtue signaling and not about character anymore  why on earth did they decide to go in this direction after endgame? this movie had it's moments but gets lost and it's on woke lack of depth  i pray this isn't the end of the marvel cinematic universe because we all enjoyed it so much  if it is the end  it was a great 11 year run  don't waste your time with this nonsense ,Positive
817,if this is considered a good marvel movie then marvel is in big trouble  completely unoriginal ,Positive
818,action would last a few minutes and then back to talking for 20 got old pretty fast and didn't need every back story shown for everyone after it was told by a character either ,Positive
819,visually outstanding  the choreography of the fight scenes was one of the greatest i ever watched in recent movies  michelle yeoh own every single scene that she was on it and awkwafina was funny as ever  and the story? great  some plot twists and with great clues to follow the next phase of the mcu!,Positive
820,oh is it beautiful the coregraphy  the fights  the landscape  the colors   the story and the script is previsible  it's good sometimes to have something classic and there it works i always though marvel universe movies have less fight   all reunited  with a classic hong kong movies such john woo ones here my toughs are listened and this is easely the most fight based of all mcu movies ever i had a great time  great subjects  editing  actors i have preferred this one globally than black widow because i see and live what i was expecting and even more ,Positive
821,another gem of marvel family compared to other popular marvel films the characters not much influences but its really worth watching film vfx work is awesome like other marvel movies ,Positive
822,i watched it in cinema  with bunch of jerks who wanted to ruin my impression of this film  and   they failed the mission  i enjoyed the film so much! a lot of lotr vibes  but more like hobbit to me (you know  fantasy world  city  lake  the rock  dragon from the mountain)  warm nostalgia about those jackie chan's action movies from childhood    and very  very beautiful locations! nice cameos  like abomination  wong etc  ben kingsley was awesome as well!,Positive
823,it was okfctcyycctctcrcrctuvy ty y y  k h h k j f f i j h ju u h ,Neutral
824,"amazing movie     i don't like he camera angel on some fight scenes but it doesn't matter  simu liu i awesome in every single one of them i like how we saw grounded kung fu still jackie chan  then some vibe from crouching tiger  hidden dragon (at least me  idk about you) i like it     i can't describe it but it is f awesome the cast is just too perfect    trevor is back and its hilarious  ""stay in the pocket!!!""complain for the cgi at some chases    too obvious cg     but i guess the vfx team doesn't have enough time to finished ",Positive
825,wow one of the best marvel movies i have seen so far!,Positive
826,"seriusly !i didn't even expected much from this movie i lost intrest in mcu after end game   i only watch phase 4 mcu just for the sake of continuation   but not whole heartedly but when i saw this kickass movie   goosebumps ! lit 🔥
no words !the music killed ! the melody of xu it's still in my ears   
the fight coreography is new   and spontaneous the guy   simu   lui perfectly synced in the shang chi roleabsolute blastevery age group  irrespective of sex caste creed can enjoy this film !",Positive
827,this film is a love letter to asia  the creatures the atmosphere the fights  they really took their time with this  many people complain about final fight but if you watch anime or know of anime you should know better ,Positive
828,this movie is centred around cheap laughs and gags  it takes all the bad parts of the old mcu movies and puts it into this film  a fart joke was the only thing left on the table i literally feel asleep in the final act since it was so bizarre  this film drags on and on and on  in 2008 this would have been amazing  i'm shocked this carry's the marvel tittle  after end game marvel had some excellent releases that continued to work on a wonderful story such as wanda and falcon but this was utter trash if you wana watch an old school kung fu movie then this is ok  i hope they don't drop the ball with externals tbh i seen a few people leave the theatre  and what's up with these over the top good reviews seems sketchy ,Positive
829,this movie had it all  it had great action and humor (which you would expect from a marvel movie)  but it was also so well layered with complex characters  compelling themes  and respect for asian culture  i found myself laughing and crying at this movie  i also loved the guest appearance from an old character long forgotten and some amazing creatures  this movie deserves all the praise it can get ,Positive
830,the movie is very entertaining  with a great cast  the fighting scenes are intense and beautiful  there are no noticeable plot holes  tony leung is amazing as alawys  and sim liu did a great job too ,Positive
831,"the start of the movie was really good  but then it became a bit boring though it was still a good movie and i love that they made a marvel movie that has asian main characters  the fighting scenes are awesome looking  the movie also has many independent women not only ""girls waiting to be rescued"" and i love how for example katy is made to be as real as possible like how she has the ""ugly"" side which i think makes her real and awesome ",Positive
832,"marvel's newest solo film that introduces an iconic hero from thier vast collection of heroes is certainly for the newer fans that didn't grow up with ""the master of kung fu""  even stan lee (who was in charge of the company but didn't create shang chi) has admitted he was a comic rip off of bruce lee in looks and style  adding a mystical and possible alien influence was in my view a mistake and not true to the character's story  nor the reimaging of the mandarin  which i found to be disappointing  aside from the tired storylines which have become common in these marvel films  the ending was a little over the top  aside from these criticisms  i'll give kudos to a good cast and wonderful cinematography  if i ever get a faithful adaption of a marvel comic i grew up with  i might be shocked  i am coming to the conclusion that these films are only for those under 30  since i don't recognize the heroes or villains  not the worse film in the marvel universe but not the best ",Positive
833,"another case of throwing so much cgi at you that it just gets old  there was a lot of good choreography ruined by it and turning the fights into ""okay stuff is happening  "" scenes instead  sure some of it looked pretty  minus all the wonky creatures that didn't need to be there  simu did a good job but the girl named after a brand of water is just horrible and unfunny just as she was in jumanji not familiar with the comics but felt very unmarvel at the end by adding neverending story type dragon and then an overly long kaiju battle? top that off with the final boss being defeated as stupidly as the aliens in war of the worlds and i can honestly say i'm not excited about this addition to the universe  especially with water brand girl staying from the looks of it  ugh definitely a low point of the newer entries in my opinion ",Positive
834,so happy to see movies like this in theaters again  the ones that give you that satisfying feeling at the end  honestly don't know if is tight to chinese culture but look quite respectful to it imho  also didn't know about the character before and the novelty didn't disappoint as instantly become one of the best heroes origin film both dc and marvel of course  most of the cast is unfamiliar to me but nothing that demerits the product  on the contraire quite surprised by the good performances  the figths are very well choreographed to the point to bring back the sensations of crouching tiger hidden dragon  the effects are so well made that is very hard to find a defect to complain about  mostly flawless to me  remarkable the smoothness of the water scenes  nature and creatures scenes are very well done too  beautiful scenes appears with some regularity  sound is terrific too  is a marvel movie and conserve the tone of all the previous ones  enjoyable  interesting  not dark  well paced and of course well done  i give a 9 to counterpart the ones giving 6 star or less  but definitely is a solid 8 to me  hope more movies like this appears more often as make super enjoyable the visit to the theatre (3d imax worth it!),Positive
835,i didn't have any expectation and ended up quite enjoying the film  the story is solid  with only minor problems  the pace  the tune  the directing  all solid it's a shame that the film isn't shown in mainland china  otherwise the box office could have doubled ,Positive
836,one of the best mcu movie!!! finally!!! i do know what people are saying but this was a fest! bravo!!!funny and with much action and amazing cgi!do not hear the negative people! they are just not happy with their life's ,Positive
837,yet another marvel movie  but with a new mystique story  which is most entertaining  parts are in mandarin  so be prepared to read the english translation  the story and visual scenes are well done specifically because it contains a lot of cgi  the martial art scenes are likewise well choreographed  almost looking like a dance routine  more ten ring movies are in the offing ,Positive
838,leung's acting was superb  so good that others were pale in comparison  simu liu's acting lacked range  aquafina was just being herself (though she was good during the final battle)  the sister was not bad  and others were dismal at best (but the jester guy was also good) great action sequences  leung's storyline was good but simplified  shang chi lacked real struggles (he didnt seem bothered by the abandonment of his sister  his ability to fight improved in one day  he sat on the dragon for a good 15min without doing anything      the list goes on)  the soundtrack was not that great  the portrayal of simple colorful villagers were     hm   solid action  leung was the highlight  meh about other stuff ,Positive
839,if you love marvel  mcu  disney  asians martial arts and movies in general  you will love this  man what an amazing story  screenplay  action and emotional film  and the fantasy elements were epic and it was not what i expected  he  shang chi is my new favorit hero  ofc i watch everything and love everything thar marve and disney does with the mcu but it was awesome because i was born watching jackie chan  bruce lee etc  it was little slow in the middle but good slow not bad slow  thanks to the story and direction ,Positive
840,"i must say i am disappointed since i had quite high expectations from this movie   or at least didn't expect it to be bad after such a promising first half  unfortunately  the second half was just that  the surprise gift of a gem in the movie however  for me  is being introduced to tony leung  i wished at several points in the movie that he were playing shang chi  3 5 out of my 5 stars is for him the movie began well even if the first ta lo fight was a little cheesy and a bit too wire fu  tony leung brings such humanity to the character  conveying so much with his eyes with no expressions or mannerisms needed  a fascinating character shrouded in mystery and danger  but with a softness and vulnerability in his eyes the rest of the first half was usual marvel magic  the acting of shang chi and katy was a little bland  but passable  i liked the humour and also the continuity of the post blip references  shang chi finally got interesting in the bus scene   unfortunately he goes back to being a personality less  second fiddle to katy for the rest of the movie  how sad this should happen in his own movie? and as if to add insult to injury  the movie ends by saying ""the ten rings will return"" instead of shang chi as mentioned in the title  the second half felt like a bad narnia movie  everything predictable and a cliche  someone says their people have been training to protect xyz for thousands of years   turns out  after all this time  they still fight with sticks and stones and have a pitiably small 'army'  said army also turns out helpless at protecting xyz and needs the protagonist to save the day after he becomes an expert at what these people trained their whole lives  in about 15 minutes  largely useless friend also saves the day when the experts can't how is it that these people have a skill that can defeat wenwu  a thousands year old martial arts master with the ten rings  but their army is so helpless against his goons and their technology? if this special skill was specifically to protect xyz  how come none of them used it in the battle? instead it seems it was developed specifically to defeat the ten rings which they have no reason to know anything about  what on earth was the point of ben kingsley in this movie? i wish they spent that screen time further exploring shang chi  his personality  relationships etc that brings me to my biggest grievance with the movie  a superhero movie should inspire   especially the origin story  it's when a character has that moment of clarity when they decide they won't let their weaknesses  or even mistakes  define them but will instead channel it all to fight for something good  shang chi's moment could have been even more poignant considering he made quite a big mistake  however i feel the movie skirted around that  saying rather than showing because they didn't want to go there  thus shang chi's moment of clarity was deciding to kill his own father  sure  he eventually doesn't during the big cgi battle   but why? was he tired? he felt he couldn't go through with it? his mother's ghost told him not to? who knows   i hope the next installment will be better  maybe shang chi will have a personality that can keep up with katy ",Positive
841,"i didn't get to see this in theaters but i don't think that would alter my perception of this movie  on the outside it well made and well acted and an enjoyable film  however it has some issues and for me  didn't live up to the hype  basically it's a jackie chan movie where jackie chan is played my simu liu and chris rock is played by awkwafina  and suddenly (or not) mysticism  it almost doesn't feel like a traditional marvel movie  if it weren't for the ""surprise"" cameos here and there  and the almost laisez fare comment referring to avengers: endgame  you'd be hard pressed to believe it is one  again it's fun  but not original ",Positive
842,with the natural expectations weighted on this movie  it was quite incredible  plot was surprising/neat and the fighting was just amazing  i thought it was respectful of eastern media and really praised a few cultures together  aquafina also did well to be enjoyable but not annoying  very well done ,Positive
843,it's not a must watch movie but it was good enough for a fun evening at the cinema the visuals and some fighting scenes were great!,Positive
844,i usually like to post my thoughts straight after seeing something new  either good or bad  but this time i just didn't care enough to bother  i just felt flat at the end  i'm sure there are plenty who enjoyed it  but the plethora of super high scores is weird  even if you want to turn your brain off and enjoy the visuals  it's still not that good  it's actually quite dull the acting is    fine  with the exception of some of liu's scenes  the whole movie's had a complete charisma bypass  and then there's awkwafina's performance   not as bad as i expected  but that was still some strange casting who knows  if they'd chopped half an hour and tightened up the story a bit  it might have worked better  but instead it was a bloated  cgi heavy snorefest  unless eternals is a surprise hit  i'm really not liking where the mcu is heading post endgame ,Positive
845,very impressive debut for a superhero flick coming in from the cold! in a competitive landscape of marvel leads  simu liu is a likeable hero and akwafina is a great foil  superb supporting cast and very good writing (and production notes  iykwim)  this one has legs  and unlikely to shrink in an ensemble ,Positive
846,very impressed with the entire movie  great visual effects  action scenes were on point  well written story  definitely a must see ,Positive
847,"i loved this movie mandarin
i thought it was great getting to see the mandarin after the iron man 3 portrayal and even seeing trevor slattery return was one of my favourite moments in recent mcu  tony leung was incredible as wenwu and delivered a compelling performance  he brought the emotional  yet unsettling character to life so well  he was amazing!shang chi
you can really tell when an actor is passionate about a role  and this is one of these times  simu liu is so passionate about this character and it really pays off  he brings a great performance  some of my favourite scenes are with him and wenwu (tony leung) having an emotional mental battle  he was great!katy awkwafina usually annoys me in movies  but not so much in this one  she is actually quite funny a lot of the time (apart from the forced mcu humour) and delivered a good sidekick performance!trevor slattery
i loved having trevor back  he was hilarious in this movie  and i love ben kingsleys portrayal of this character xialing
i thought she was pretty cool  it's cool to see what's happening with her going forward overall just a great movie  the colour grading in this movie is gorgeous too! the choreography is the best we've seen in the mcu thanks to brad simpson (rip) and really feels authentic to the old jackie movies  i absolutely loved the chinese culture in this movie  it was amazing to see it all  especially the dragons  the music was also incredible  might be my favourite mcu score!overall 9/10!",Positive
848,"the 3rd cinema visit this year (2021) for me brought a delightful marvel film i really enjoyed this film  it has it all: inspired martial arts  humor   character developments  emotions  and its also quite spectacular  even if we may thinnk we've ""seen it all already"" with so much visual effects heavy movies coming out over these past ten years or so it makes you marvel (pun intended) and laugh 
it has a heart of goodness i can very much recommend seing this movie in a cinema ",Positive
849,i am not a comic book reader and i knew nothing about any of the marvel characters but i have enjoyed the movies so far  and this movie is no exception! it was greatly entertaining  i liked the characters even though i knew nothing about them coming into the movie  it was funny  and cool action scenes and overall  just a good movie!,Positive
850,incredible start to finish! cast is perfect! mind blowing special effects  can't give enough praise! go see this!,Positive
851,the beginning of the movie was very good (apart from the brake linkage being severed  which would have automatically applied the brakes)  first rule of comedy  you need reality  that said  the scene wouldn't have gone the way they wanted it to  had it done so the relationship of the father/son  started off well  we were then introduced to the now loathsome wokeism  which is now being stuffed down our throats daily by the political theatre  a quick message to disney  stop it now!  or you may well suffer the consequences of that wokeism  coming back to haunt you sir ben kingsley  whaaat!! was he supposed to be some sort of comic relief?? (or did he need the money) katy  well what can one say  one days training  and she's as good as clint barton (hawkeye)  gimme a break!the cgi  was way over the top  unfortunately it was nearly a snoozfest  almost!!so  that's the reasoning for my 2 stars  disney is ruining everything get their hands on at present ,Positive
852,chang chi was created in the early 70's in the bruce lee craze and quickly died out  as did the kung fu mania in the west  that its been revived now is nothing to do with the marvel universe but a sop to the chinese market by making a westernised version of their standard  over the top  chop socky movies  hidden tiger  crouching dragon style  seriously  if you like that genre you'll probably like this  but for anyone outside the orient  it's pointless  just disneys grasping at cash ratherthan moving a storyline onwards ,Positive
853,this was a powerful film for asians everywhere  as marvel takes into an era of inclusion and expansion story wise  shang chi was good  not great  but solid  displays asian values perfectly  i found a few of the chinese lines irritating to hear  as a native mandarin speaker the martial arts sequences were simply amazing  fights scenes were captivating and beautiful  with superb special affects on top of the actual martial arts  with the eternals coming up  marvel is clearly upping its cgi and special affects making much more cinematographic films my only complaint was the ending  went from one of marvel's best into godzilla  i don't think you'll find anyone praising it  a weak ending for an overall amazing film ,Positive
854,"it started out ok but some of the script wasn't great  the parts that were good were outstanding it seemed mcu or disney didn't really have their heart and soul in it
the hidden politics embedded in it was not that hidden with all the metaphors felt like a lesson  kids will love it  it's that kind of movie  it's a bit childish
hoped for more ",Positive
855,i watched it at home today and i felt that why did i miss it on theatres  it's a amazing movie for the fans of fantasy genre  after watching this one i became a fan of fantasy genre movies  guys go for this one  it will take you to the best magical world for an amazing roller coaster ,Positive
856,this film is everything i wanted to be  and it's actually even better than i expected  the action sequences are awesomely bad a  the jokes and comedic scenes are hilarious and never unfunny  the cgi is great  the emotional scenes hit hard  and the cinematography is gorgeous  and it's also something fresh and unique  and it doesn't feel like a marvel movie (if that makes sense) which i like  and it also brings something new to the mcu  overall  this film is fantastic  and sometimes even emotional  and i recommend you go watch this at the cinema for the full experience  10/10 ,Positive
857,a super smooth blend of magic  martial arts and mythology  the chemistry between the two leads is spot on and it's hilarious  some of the best choreographey in the mcu and a really memorable villain  if you want the full experience  watch in a cinema and i'd personally recommend watching iron man 3 first ,Positive
858,i've just got out the unlimited screening 10 out of 10 best marvel action origin film of mcu if u love action fantasy film this is ur film ,Positive
859,marvel has proven over the past 13 years that they're able to take any character no matter how obscure or outlandish and give them a franchise that people are eager to see  everything from a motley crew of galactic misfits to a man with shrinky powers  nothing is off limits  shang chi and the legend of the ten rings this time introduces audiences to the titular character who simply has spectacular martial arts abilities  compared to some of his big screen peers shang chi's usp and skill set may sound simplistic  but the truth is far from it shang chi and the legend of the ten rings sees shang chi try to escape his villainous father and his criminal empire and to instead live a normal simple life  of course  this doesn't go to plan  and he must fight his father and the members of his shady organization  it is my pleasure to report that the film is a thrilling adventure that entertains from start to finish  delivering some of the best action scenes in the mcu to date as well as a surprising number of laughs  that's not to say the film is a comedy akin to guardians of the galaxy or thor: ragnarok  but its moments of levity come at the appropriate moments and land well the master of kung fu shang chi is played by simu liu  who does an excellent job not only at the spectacular fight scenes but also in the scenes in which his fits are not colliding with a deadly ninja's jaw  in direct opposition to his father  shang chi is a laid back everyman with no grand ambition for his life  he's happy with his low level job and loves a night out with his friends  not to mention the karaoke  he's charming and funny  and a welcome addition to the marvel universe speaking of martial arts  you may be wondering; hang on  doesn't everyone in the marvel movies do some variation of martial arts? from black widow to captain american  they're all capable fighters  is shang chi really that much better? the answer is simply yes  shang chi more than delivers when it comes to the fight scenes  delivering tense  flowing  spectacular grounded fights that are a highlight of the film  they were truly fantastic  creative  and more than worth repeat viewings if you've seen the trailer for the film  you'll know the film promises a lot  if you haven't  i won't ruin anything here  but if you're worried too much has been given away rest easy knowing that the film is stuffed with surprises and twists that will both shock and amaze you it's no secret that marvel heroes are likable and the films they're in spending a lot of time making the audience care about them  with a rich backstory and motivations anyone can empathize with  this is however often at the cost of the villain  who can sometimes prove to be underwhelming  underdeveloped and unsympathetic they are more often than not the weakest part of the otherwise enjoyable movie  shang chi and the legend of the ten rings introduces xu wenwu aka the mandarin  the leader of the ten rings  a word concurring criminal organization  in addition to being the wielder of the ten rings  ten mystical powerful rings which he wears as bracelets  the mandarin is played by hong kong superstar tony leung chiu wai and is one of the film's greatest strengths and one of the best marvel villains to date  he's bad for sure and does terrible things but he's not a mustache twirling cartoon  he has believable motivations and is given ample screen time to develop into a complex character that any audience can emphasize  in addition to that  he is father to shang chi  making their relationship complex and interesting the finale ups the stakes in spectacular fashion  swapping out the grounded fights that have come before for something altogether grander  i found this to be one of the most entertaining and thrilling sequences of the film  but others may have different sensibilities and not feel the same  for me  however  it totally worked and undoubtedly one of the crazier things marvel has done shang chi and the legend of the ten rings introduces audiences to a new character and a whole new corner of the marvel universe  both of which are fleshed out and unlike anything that has come before  in addition to this the characters  both good and bad are equally pleasing with great motivation and rich backstories  its connections to the wider universe are there  which will please many people  but the film more than stands on its own  it's true that before shang chi and the legend of the ten rings many of the audience will have never heard of shang chi before  but after they won't be able to stop talking about him ,Positive
860,the action is the movie's biggest selling point  the hand to hand combat is done exceptionally well and the use of the environment and camera movement added to the flow and intensity of each scene character development and interactions is also fine  the only criticism i have is how the final fight got a bit too cgi heavy  it really didn't need the super fantastical elements and definitely took away the character development the story was building up to  it kind of just felt like the higher ups said a marvel movie needs something grandiose despite the rest of the film was kept grounded other than this  and the fact that a side character was able to pull a mvp hit out of thin air  the movie is very enjoyable  there is some truly breathtaking scenes and there's plenty of memorable martial arts scenes to go around  growing up with these kung fu movies  i think you'll enjoy it as much as i did ,Positive
861,this is definitely the best marvel movie i've seen in a while and probably the most un marvel feeling one too  the fight seems are incredible   the bus fight being the stand out  fantastic choreography and heavily influenced by old martial arts movies  the cgi throughout is amazing too as you'd expect from marvel  i felt the amount of comedy was just right with ben kingsley smashing it again as trevor   superb  as others have commented there are some pacing issues in the second half but overall it's a fun ride so enjoy! the first end credits scene is worth holding on for but don't bother with the second!,Positive
862,have you watched a marvel action superhero movie before?what if you've watched  all the marvel superhero movies?then you're in for some hot garbage in this movie  as this was made to order  copying every scene from other marvel movies i mean every fight scene just felt like i'd watched it before  except now the characters doing them i had even less connection with  i'm bored with fights on buses and trains and people leaping around scaffolding  every marvel movie has a fight scene on a bus or a train  but this one felt really recycled getting back round to the characters  besides shang chi  i can't remember his sisters name  or his weird friends name  who served zero purpose in the movie  accept serving as a loud mouthed joke teller  it was almost as if they wanted a kevin hart like star  but had to settle with awkwafina? and shang's sister? just added nothing to the story or the movie  she looked nothing like shang either  or her younger self  the casting was well off there ben kingsley showing up was amusing  but honestly that was it when it cames to laughs  you could see every joke coming up 30 seconds before it was delivered  because it was a recycled joke from other marvel superhero movie wong and the abomination make a cameo appearance in this movie  but their addition is given no context  and makes zero sense  and adds nothing to the movie or their own stories overall  i'd just say every character felt  just like a chinese copy or a character you've already seen in a marvel movie before  by the end  i felt like i had watched a propaganda movie made by the ccp  it was like ordering a chinese  except it came drowned in a bath of chinese sauce  served on a bed of soggy chinese mythology  even the post credit scene wasn't worth sticking around to watch as it contains marvel's most hated character to ever get a movie in it ,Positive
863,"the ""crouching tiger  hidden wakanda"" layering on of endless flashbacks and ""ancient legends"" gets a bit thick (and sags noticeably in the back half)  but overall this addition of an asian superhero story hits all the right notes  powered mainly by 2 early bravura action sequences (scaffolding on the side of a high rise mirror glass tower is especially well rendered)  the performances are solid  if not exactly groundbreaking (michelle teoh especially has little new to do)  and the direction is serviceable  but the whole thing ends in yet another cgi heavy big bass fight that is just    well  way too predictable  snazzy post credit sequence teases dr strange but also adds more mystery to the 10 rimgs    which is becoming marvel's staple out: always teasing better content next time  even that's wearing a bit thin ",Positive
864,i really wanna do the michael pena summary  but here's a much shorter version:so its like a joy of luck club mini reunion  but then there's this parkour on crack session    but then they ride mr weasley's enchanted car to this chinese wakanda  and then ride mulan's mushu to fight the chinese kraken and save the world    and basically awkwafina and wong steal the show! welcome to the hotel californiaaasa!,Positive
865,i'm kinda gutted  this started so well  the first hour was great  it felt original and funny  the acting and action was so great  but then i all goes downhill very fast  i guess you could say it goes from adults film to kids film in the blink of an eye ,Positive
866,"i know  i know    it's an mcu origin story   of course it's gonna be formulaic  they all have been up to this point but    maybe i'm just tired of it at this point  maybe i've had too much  this one just felt *so* by the numbers that i could literally predict everything that happens in a scene  as soon as it started   and i wasn't even trying my brain just did it completely on its own   ""oh i bet now they're gonna argue and the argument will be interrupted by bad guys attacking""  etc  every time it just made the movie very hard to enjoy i'm still giving it a 6 because  if you're not already overly familiar with the marvel formula it might be pretty fun  and the actors do a good job  the martial arts scenes are pretty cool  the jokes are okay and the characters are likable  it also makes sure to have lots of easter eggs and references to previous mcu titles  to keep you entertained so there's enough decent stuff to put it in the higher half of the rating options  but just barely ",Positive
867,"a tad too heavy on the cgi and a bit too much wire work  making it more like ""crouching tiger"" in some of the fight scenes  but definitely one i'll enjoy re watching ",Positive
868,wow what a stinker! who wanted this movie made? who are they that this movie was made for? clearly not china as they won't allow it to be shown in their country  just another boring mcu movie  probably was worth more than a 1 star but all those 9 and 10 star ratings are undeserved  i'd recommend waiting till this is free on your disney+ subscription without paying their ridiculous mark up of $30  it's worth waiting for! definitely not worth going to the theater and paying your hard earned money to see it ,Negative
869,incredibly boring and indifferent film  with stereotypical characters and a predictable story  following the superheroes formula  i watched the 3 d version  which looked like bad animation and completely distanced me from the film  the only redeeming qualities were a few inspired shots and the inclusion of some decent actors    especially the wonderful michelle yeoh ,Negative
870,this has replaced thor dark world / captain marvel for being the weakest film  it's not bad but it's a standard plot with too much back and forth story telling and has random monsters that have no back story or reasoning for what they are  action scenes are entertaining but just didn't care for the characters ,Positive
871,amazing visuals  phenomenal fight choreography and a genuinely interesting story  i never knew about the character before but shang chi has already become a favourite of mine  i really hope he shows up in dr strange: multiverse of madness ,Positive
872,"so  the fighting scenes were good  cgi not bad  chemistry in the movie between the cast were near absent  woowoo had an arc just for the big final fight to happen but whatever movie is a 7 at best  but i removed 2 stars because katywhat in the ass donkey is this character 
so annoying  every scene she is in just drains your brain even the voice  like woman  clear your throat or stop smoking or something ffs  feels like it was the only other asian chick available in wokewood ",Positive
873,i watched this with a bit of unease  but it was better than expected  it felt like several movie smooshed together and sometimes they didn't coalesce correctly  first you have the typical chinese legend type film  crouching tiger  sword of destiny etc  with the line of forgiveness and great loss and manipulation   but as far as integrating in to the world of marvel it doesn't do that  explanations are left very weak so it basically becomes a high end martial arts film with the chinese legend thrown in don't get me wrong  i actually liked it but i don't know why because i can sit and think of a lot of times i rolled my eyes  for instance the sister is just plain annoying and really didn't need to be in the plot and felt like she was shoe horned in    really take her out and basically it would of panned out the same but without the boring sister with a chip on her shoulder and daddy issues ,Negative
874,over rated  it wasn't that good the acting was fine  at some point it was really boring  the last bottle was fine the story was good but suddenly was boring dont waste your time ,Positive
875,"an enjoyable movie and has some witty humor and other familiar aspects from marvel  the execution was done right but was still pretty predictable  there was no blood with slashes and hits which made it really feel like a kid's movie  the premise and plot are great but what that leads the characters to do    is very predictable  when i saw shang chi exit the elevator into an under ground facility  i already knew he would fight and that it would be his sister  the family dynamic didn't fit right at all  especially the way the family interacted with eachother after what i've seen in the flashbacks  the choreography was spectacular even though some fights made it seem like the 2 characters fight were still going easy on eachother i predicted like 80% of what was gonna happen like :
the sister fighting the brother in the fighting ring
dad dying and giving shang chi the rings
girl learning the bow
the two teams working together in the final fight
etcoverall  a good watch!",Positive
876,brilliant movie with brilliant actors!! i love the connection of shang chi to the mcu  it was action packed  funny and brilliant storyline  can't wait for a sequel!!,Positive
877,a great introduction to a new mcu hero  great marvel humor and can not wait to see more  they did the back story justice with this fresh take on the 10 rings ,Positive
878,movie was jam packed with great choreography   visual effects and story some parts pacing was too slow but in general a great movie!,Positive
879,so the best way to describe the last big release from marvel  black widow  is dull  poor story  badly cast  terrible villain  lack lustre action i went into this film completely ready for disappointment  and instead found it to be the perfect marvel recipe!correct casting  everyone is perfect as far as i'm concerned nice pace to the story  i never felt bored excellent villain  i really wanted to like him even though he had done so much to hate  which is the best kind of villain it stayed connected with what we know but challenged how we know it  marvel needs to use this as it's foundation for film structure and continue to try new things  they also need to avoid taking beloved characters and dulling their edge over time (i'm looking at bucky barnes  black widow and bruce banner specifically) what i'm saying is  see this movie  it doesn't disappoint  if you like the better marvel movies like gotg  avengers  captain america 2 etc this should nicely work for you as a mixture of the bunch ,Positive
880,i realize that there are some problematic elements in the original shang chi master of kung fu comics and i was not expecting a 1:1 between comics and movie  but this has nothing in common with the comics except the name of main character its a fine martial arts movie and good fun for most of the family as its the usual soft violence from marvel where people might die  but it happens very cleanly i assume there is both cultural and copyright issues with using dr fu manchu at the main villain  but he was always the most interesting part of that universe   a villain utterly devoid of pity and wielding virtually unknown science that seemed a mix of black magic  alchemy and traditional science  he could easily have been updated instead of turning him into a bland martial arts powered warlord all in all   this movie fails spectacularly in leveraging the entire gallery of interesting characters and stories from the comic books and i must say i was very disappointed at the cookie cutter martial arts adventure i got served up ,Positive
881,the scenes in this movie are great  the pictures look fantastic and the chinese world is wonderfully filmed  the characters are well written and the villain is arguably one of the mcu's best  really fun and good movie  highly recommended ,Positive
882,"the movie as a whole is a decent watch  it has some great ideas and fight scenes  but it all just seems a little shallow  and like the movie is scare of commit to anything so it just ends up falling like none of the great potential ever amounts to any thing the actor who portrays shang chi does a good job  but he unfortunately does not get much depth to work with  he starts and ends his character ark at basically the same spot  he does not really get any moments to express any real emotion for me there are 3 main problems 1  the sister character is only there to show a female character can be a badass   ""we know  don't cram it down our throats"" it makes it feel forced  and takes away the impact of the character  but the main problem of focusing so much on her is that the main character in the story never really gets enough time to develop a character 2  the mandarin  never feels really intimidating og loving  they try to be so middle of the road on everything with this character  that he neither feels believeable as any of those opposites or as ""real person"" in general  a shame because i don't think the actor is to blame  it is simply poor writing and directing 3  shang chi  doesn't feel like he has much impact on the story  especially in the second half  where the is more focus on secondary roles than him  and his impact on the final battle is minimal at best  the first half of the movie is clearly the stongest  and goes kinda downhill from there there is one special cameo though  that is sure to delight and give some laughs over all it was worth a watch  but not much more than that ",Positive
883,if only marvel gave them more budget  the cgi could be more beautiful than this  the acting  the plot   the action are soooooo beautiful ,Positive
884,a marvel movie with dragons and martial arts i liked the story and thought the vfx were really good ,Positive
885,as a 90s kid thats a mcu fan since day 1 this is such a shame  the cgi is too obvious and too weird  its fairly similar to a low budget indonesia's indosiar dragon movies  they try to fit too much of a character in this movie and doesn't show any character development in the movie  the main character and his sister cast act so awkward and weirdly patriotic  i really wanted a refund and composition for spending 2 hours watching this  the only good thing here is that michelle here is still stunning ps  wasn't so bad if it wasn't a mcu ,Negative
886,i'm not a fan of marvel movies  not because i don't like them  but more simply because i never had enough time to see them all  thus losing all the connections between the various plots fortunately  this film also seems to work on its own  except for a few passages that deserve some more knowledge of course  like the films of the universe it is a part of  this film is all too perfect  there isn't a smudge and not even the secondary characters never even look disheveled it will seem counterintuitive  but personally when you see something so neat  i lose interest because it will seem too fake even some dialogue  especially at the beginning of the film  seems so stupid that it sounds irritating that said  the film still works  entertains and has its right emotional charge to make you follow the film to the end without ever getting bored the characters are interesting and it's easy to get attached to them  like all marvel movies  i guess we'll see them again soon  and this movie was a nice way to introduce them to us  ultimately  a movie that you will enjoy even if you are not a huge marvel fan ,Positive
887,what a great flick  the action was amazing throughout  constantly growing and changing so the fights never got boring  awkwafina is a favourite of mine and did a great job  family relationships really do make the most compelling of stories  we got an antagonist that had a tragic and understandable story  he never felt 1 dimensional like so many other hero rising villains ,Positive
888,when marvel first announced its phase 4  i admit that i wasn't exactly excited about shang chi  i had never even heard of the hero  so i was a lot more hyped for spiderman and doctor strange than a complete unknown watching the movie  i was pleasantly surprised  simu liu is very likable as the main character  while tony leung is a big name in china and he demonstrates why  the man is a criminal who trained his own child as an assassin  yet through his acting you still feel sympathy for him when he broods over his lost love the fighting scenes are also exceptionally well done and visually the movie is stunning  trying to incorporate some oriental elements into the mcu sure there are some woke snippets here and there  they sadly seem mandatory for any movie these days  things like katy mastering archery in a couple of days or shang chi's sister teaching herself combat because their father wouldn't train a girl and despite that  somehow being on the main character's level  but you can overlook these with a little effort if there is one thing i did not enjoy  it's the scenes with the dragon  i feel that it bogged down the movie with an unnecessary cgi fest  for me  it would have served the movie a lot better if the story focused on pure combat and the 10 rings themselves  i would have also liked to see shang chi struggle more with his upbringing  it would have made his character a lot more interesting and nuanced than presenting a child assassin as a well adjusted typical american despite the above points which in my eyes are missed opportunities  the movie was definitely better than i expected and the mere fact that i look forward to seeing more of shang chi  makes me count this as a win for marvel ,Positive
889,sorry  kung fu not my thing  action sequences too fast to keep up with  end battle too busy and fast to keep track of who where doing what?if you didn't have an idea of the connections with the rings  then would be lost as to how this fits with marvel at all    except for mid credits trailer for me  below par  too busy and mediocre at best ,Positive
890,"i have no idea how this movie got to be so hyped  but because of that i for one definitely went in with high expectations  which i normally don't fall for  but i've really not seen anything negative about it  so i thought  ok  this must really be that good i guess aaaand  no  
other than the fighting choreography  which is probably one of the best in the marvel movies released thus far  everything else falls flat on its face by far the biggest problem is the casting  not one character in this movie stands out  and it never feels like they ""fit in""  which is something that marvel has excelled at with their former movies  par captain marvel of course  but this is why it's important to have charismatic actors and proper casting both ""katy"" and ""xialing"" stuck out like a sore thumb  the acting was atrocious and the forced ""comedy"" scenes made me cringe in my seat at times honestly  not since captain marvel have i seen such god awful casting  and there's definitely magnitudes better actors out there  but they went with this for some reason    you are also made to believe that ""shang chi"" and ""katie"" are together  but i've never seen such little charisma between two characters in a movie before main character  not quite as bad  but it really didn't feel like he fit into the role  i could see him being fine for another studio  but again  it's marvel and you have certain expectations from them i won't go much into the story and writing  cause it was mediocre and forgettable  with a lot of cliches and ""jokes"" that didn't land at all honestly  this felt like a bootleg version of a marvel movie  just incredibly overhyped when this doesn't go above a 6 on a good day  and while i typed that i suddenly realized why it got so hyped   rather obvious really  but i'm not from the us  so it just dawned on me now oh well  either way  if you're bored and got nothing to do  it's ok  just don't expect the usual marvel quality ",Positive
891,i don't care about this because i want something nicer & cooler ,Neutral
892,my thoughts on shang chi are that this was a really good movie and it is actually one of the better marvel movies  i really enjoyed this movie  the fight choreography was really great and it almost reminded me of crouching tiger in some scenes  it also gave me some jackie chan movie vibes in some parts like the way shang chi fought  it really connected to the marvel universe really well i thought and it also expands it as well  the acting was top notch all around  i thought i was going to hate awkwafina but she actually did a great job she was really funny and she could get emotional in some scenes  a lot of the comedy landed but there was some minor jokes that weren't funny but i got passed those and the other jokes made up for it the mandarin was a really intimidating figure  i really thought he could destroy anyone  the big fight scene at the end was really awesome and it's a huge spectacle that had me on the edge of my seat  i loved how they implemented the asian culture into the films plot  it also ties in some threads from pass movies that really made me glad to finally have answers for  the cgi was amazing and it was very awe inspiring to watch  this was way better than the last marvel movie and i really want to see more of shang chi in the future  i give shang chi and the legend of the ten rings a 9/10 ,Positive
893,"i loved every bit of this movies   
it keeps you on the edge of your seat   
loved katy  she is probably the total backbone of this movie   amazing action   everything delivered for which marvel's stands for !!woowwwww!!!",Positive
894,"was absolutely painful to watch it second time  where to start from   
every single character's move  line and story twist n turn was annoyingly predictable than ever  so unpleasantly unsurprising  acting was tagged  a total cliché  not a single try or aiming to be more original than the first viewing  means no creativity  the humor was irritating  the action scenes were less exciting than watching a parody of swan lake at the local school  camera work  if there was anything like ""work""  felt like they have tied up a half broken
camera on a limping mule's back  and have left  editing is most atrocious: shot transitions felt long  even and boring  seems they've forgot to buy themselves a watch  sequences have lost every meaning in the world they might have had in the first place  the soundtrack couldn't have been more inappropriate and insipid       
expecting to like it? don't watch it twice  not even once ",Negative
895,fighting coreographies are really good  music is perfect  the rest is awful ,Positive
896,this was the worst movie i've seen in decades  0 characters  0 script  0 logic  0 originality  really really stupid plot  even the vfx were poor oh my god  marvel is scratching the barrel and let's the quality diminish by the minute  if it doesn't start investing in quality (meaning decent script and different tone) soon marvel movies will be the new westerns  lame  boring  predictable ,Negative
897,"choreography was fine   until the 3 fight cause is repetitive    everything starts becoming so boring   cliche    stereotypical i would say  
there are better jet li or jackie chan movies in my opinion if you are into the genre   
i get it   it's a marvel movie   people feel like is super different and well i guess it is in a way but to me many key points are terrible forced    the acting is bad   sorry but it is    i think awkafina was ok but a little to much as the corky sidekick    and sadly i couldn't find appeal with the lead actor   ",Negative
898,i nearly fell asleep in the first 15 min of the movie then it picked up a little after that it was so boring i got up and left half way through the movie ,Negative
899,it's nothing but a larger than life chinese martial art movie in fantasy  action  adventure genre     no way upto marvel standard     yeah budget is high so the action sequences  vfx and graphics are great     but the story or the theme is same as of those fantasy action adventure chinese movies     it's nothing new presenting a old dish adding some spices in new plate     that's it i personally don't like it ,Positive
900,i've been waiting for this movie for a long time  but it was a huge disappointment a very boring movie  a silly  naive childish story & those who played katy  i have never seen a more ridiculous or worse actress than her in my life  i could not bear to see her  and every time i heard her voice  that was a real torment  in the worst nightmares i could not find something worse! hearing her voice for a minute worse than tormenting for eternity in the worst prisons in the world!,Negative
901,this was a risk making a movie starring a mostly asian cast  and i have to say that it paid off! simu liu was truly perfect casting! he not only got the essence of the character  making him relatable and likeable  but it seemed that he helmed much of the action scenes  there were multiple wide shots of hand to hand combats that absolutely blew my mind  i could not stop smiling!the director did an absolutely fantastic job leading this film  i just wished the 2nd act of the movie was paced a bit quicker  there was some set up during the second act that i wish perhaps came at the beginning  but this is a very very minor critique  and it may just be a me thing all in all  this is the type of movie i want to pay to see  please hollywood  make more movies like this: movies with heart and conviction in the craft!,Positive
902,unexpected visual stunning of one another marvels presentation in this year  specially first half of story telling  action choreography are awesome  and fresh appearance of shang che with katy  both are fresh and cute  and should praise their performance  casting director choose very well the main characters of shang che  but one boring thing is that why ban kingsley? that was weird character of the movie first half is more batter than second half  final sequence of this movie is not new rather than any other chinese fantasy movie  but yes  shang che is a good family movie of this year ,Positive
903,it was a rollercoaster ride all along  i'm not a big mcu fan but this one has to be respected  shang chi gave different vibes every 10 min  after a few laughs a serious scene comes long and in the middle again a laughing moment   it was a fresh movie to watch and would surely recommend it ,Positive
904,way too much bad cgi  terrible writing  and an average storyline in this movie  i was excited to watch this movie only to see that the hype was more than what the movie delivered  the last two mcu films just haven't been the greatest  kind of disappointing actually ,Positive
905,finally!!!!i was super excited when i saw the trailer for this movie and it did not disappoint  about time some asian superhero's are being showcased ,Positive
906,this movie has some great action scenes things we haven't seen in a while and it's refreshing but this doesn't seem like a marvel movie at all  there is literally only two or three things linking it to the marvel universe  so  if you wanna watch it i recommend it but like i said don't look at it as a marvel movie  also trevor was fun to see again ,Positive
907,"felt more like a disney production than a mcu movie  the supernatural aspects especially seem like they were sourced from a disney workflow good character development  especially for the mandarin  but some stuff seemed glossed over  the final ""boss battle"" was a bit of cgi overload  at least for me  much more than any other mcu movie despite my specific picks at the movie  it's very enjoyable  from an americana perspective  i'd put it a bit below black panther  at the time of this review words have been said that makes any followup of this movie questionable at best there are two trailers  one middle  one ending  interesting fluff but not important  especially since such a followup may not happen ",Positive
908,one of if not the best marvel film i've seen  even better then black panther  go see it for yourself if your don't believe me  the spotty the humour the graphics the fight scenes everything is great in this movie ,Positive
909,shang chi is a fun entry into the marvel cinematic universe  the fight scenes are great and the backstory is very interesting  overall  a film definitely worth seeing ,Positive
910,let me just say i didn't know what to expect going into this movie  but i'm glad i bought the tickets  the story was amazing and the fighting scenes were really good choreographed and just overall top tier camerawork  the actor who played him is amazing and the movie was amazingly funny definitely worth watching ,Positive
911,great movie  likeable cast  great fights  good story  very excited to see more shang chi in the mcu  hope he becomes a big element in the coming movies ,Positive
912,"there is something about the recent marvel movies that i don't like  maybe it's because i had never heard of many of the characters before  but maybe that's because they just aren't as interesting as the most well known characters in the marvel cannon whatever it is  i enjoyed shang chi a lot more than the previous lesser known characters movies black widow  captain marvel  black panther (those were terrible)  although i did like ant man and guardians of the galaxy because of the humor gave the characters more personality  and doctor strange was just wonderfully strange and well fleshed out  but i really did not like avengers infinity wars/endgame  what a headache in story telling those were  they had their moments all the same anyway   
i say all that as a baseline for where i'm coming from with my perspective on shang chi i went into this with my eyes ready to roll  but was pleasantly surprised  there was a solid infusion of humor with awkafina (who has grown on me quite a bit)  and an interesting back story with the main character's family  and his power ""reveal"" was a real highlight the story just got a little flat half way through  perhaps the premise leading up to it was just not strong enough  and that could do with his character not being that complex  there seemed to be very little inner conflict with the main character that hasn't been done a million times in some sort of super hero story ",Positive
913,"it's great   ! really   
this review is too short ",Positive
914,i think this movie was so enjoyable and funny  a lot better than black widow  the fight scenes are all perfect and visuals too  acting was perfect by shang chi' actor and wong ,Positive
915,watchable  but a typical marvel/dc movie: predictable  too long  boring and superficial protagonists  in this film they first watch how someone gets murdered and then still do not take action?!! if boring and predictable is your thing then this is your movie  if not then this movie can go on the pile of movies you could ever watch if you really but then really have nothing to do in your life!,Negative
916,watchable  but a typical marvel/dc movie: predictable  too long  boring and superficial protagonists  in this film they first watch how someone gets murdered and then still do not take action?!! if boring and predictable is your thing then this is your movie  if not then this movie can go on the pile of movies you could ever watch if you really but then really have nothing to do in your life!,Negative
917,really cool costumes  fighting was alright  plot was boring and the characters weren't challenged very much  wasted dragons  movie would've been better without akwafina ,Negative
918,this movie reminds me of the old kung fu movies of jackie chan and bruce lee  the fight sequences are extremely well shot and choreographed and wenwu might be one of the best villains of the mcu  simu liu is a very charismatic actor and i'm hoping he gets his own sequel  definitely recommend everyone to give this movie a watch ,Positive
919,nice visual but awkward acting  not so wow  storyline was really good but simu liu as shang chi was not a great choice  i thought it was a good movie  but actually a bit of disappointed ,Positive
920,"amazing cgi story  beginning of a new character and absolutely amazing credit shot
in this movie every second your are going to open your mouth and surprised
good luck for the fourth stage  this movie raised my expectations for other works  i pray they don't drop again ",Positive
921,hilarious  amazing special effects  great cast  strong villain and very powerful and a great performance from awkwafina and really  really funny with great callback with wong and hilarious performance from ben kingsley as trevor slattery  an overall brilliant movie  great film ,Positive
922,"as a marvel fanatic this movie has a lot of explaining to do   the rings how did mandarin got the legendary rings and how did the villagers os tao lo captured those demons and many more   
but it would be lot more better if the set up was in any country but nyc   there are places more than nyc which marvel should understand as they have so many characters ",Positive
923,shang chi is not the classic marvel movie and i appreciate that  the direction in two situations is brilliant otherwise nothing special  the plot does not tell me much and the motivation of the villain (the mandarin) i find very stupid  we see that marvel is focusing a lot on shang chi  especially for the scene after the credits  the characters are not very characterized  except in the relief comic  overall i find it a forgettable film  apart from two action scenes ,Positive
924,i loved the movie   it is awesome   in fact i've never seen this type of amazing marvel movie   the story line   the graphics   the vfx   the visuals are just fantaboulous    i strongly suggest you to whatch this piece of art  loved the acting of the actors   i really loved the way they mixed american and chinese culture with chinese language used here and there     great movie ,Positive
925,a movie with excessive use of cgi and no plot what so ever  a horrible piece which requires you to disable all brain activity to enjoy with some mediocre acting and horrible dialogue  do approach with danger because this one is about to waste your time wouldn't recommend this to anyone  will forget about he whole piece the next day and yet again ponder what on earth people are into these days  and why something like this even exists ,Negative
926,"this has a lot of great scenes  but the katy character was too much  the story was good enough without her ""comedy relief""  she bummed me out  especially when she hit the monster in the throat  i know i'm supposed to suspend disbelief but there's a limit  and why did wong need her? i was just getting annoyed at her  most of the rest was really good ",Positive
927,"another global treath another villain that gonna kill the entire reallity  (speaking abault this  whats the name of the villain again? oh  i cant remember )
another secret organization that ""shape the history""  ""take down government"" bla bla bla its not a good movie  the script its bad  some characters are forced into the movie  even the cgi  too much cgi  and it is not a good cgi ",Negative
928,"this movie is very overrated  however i cannot deny that it was overall an enjoyable movie  unlike many movies of today  nothing seems particularly forced here  so that's a good sign from the get go as a chinese myself  i found the mix between the two languages to flow really nicely throughout this movie  the chinese dialogue was given plenty of breadth and not at all a means to an end  and overall  i found the portrayal of chinese culture and ethnicity to be authentic the story cliché about purpose and ""living up to your potential"" is nothing new  but i found it really meaningful here and not at all empty  there are parts of the story that fall weak  but there are more than 2 200 reviews here so i am sure all the criticisms has already been covered action scenes were awesome and epic  cinematography and visuals were also great  but nothing too outstanding it is a shame though that this marvel movie is overshadowed by the success of its predecessors  as it's not by any means a bad movie  but it may seem that way to some  can't say the same for black widow  though    now that's a truly bad movie ",Positive
929,who keeps giving these latest mcu projects such high rating? fanboys with low expectations  or the people who work for disney that need to países this garbage in order to keep their jobs?,Positive
930,the start of the movie didn't feel like a marvel movie  even black widow felt more connected  maybe it's because it was so clearly a tribute to chinese martial arts movies  it just felt out of place despite it's runtime  the movie's rather rushed  still  until the dragon statue receives its eyes (you'll know what that means if you've watched the movie  it's just another generic action movie with average cgi  too much forced humor and unintesting characters that were pretty dislikable  especially katy  the only purpose she serves is comedic relief  but all she succeeds at is grief the battle was so and so  no guns  although it's the 21st century  despite his father using the rings for a thousand years  shang chi quickly masters wielding the ten rings because his mother has apparently trained him when he was young  i mean  if my parents taught me how to drive when i was five  no doubt i would've been able to drive any car to perfection two decades later  right? right  and then he proceeds to defeat the very big evil bad monster with little to no effort the movie had potential  but it tries too hard to be funny and ends up spending too little time developing its characters  as a result  the only character with some depth was the bad guy    later in the movie  this changes  and you think wasn't that bad afte   shabaaamm  we're back in san francisco with the forced humor bits and that just ruined the somewhat satisfying ending in the other world entertaining  but mildly frustrating  one of the lesser movies in the mcu ,Negative
931,honestly  i'm very happy to write a good review for a change!! it's been almost 2 years since anything decent came out ( tenet was amazing too) but pretty much everything was garbage! i thought that bar of quality has fallen so low and no way back up!but holy cow!!!!! everything about this movie is great! it's funny  it's beautiful  has great writing  great cg  amazing fighting scenes  and even magical creatures!neutral non political proper comic book story!well done mr  kevin & louis!please keep up! and thank you 🙏,Positive
932,this is most definitely worth the watch  the action isnt over the top predictable  its enjoyable  this even has a tie in to the marvel uni so this can go places ,Positive
933,just as i thought i was done with the marvel universe i've been sucked back in  another great instalment ,Positive
934,a story told beautifully  one of if not the best origin story ever told in marvel cinematic universe  so much color and so much diversity  kudos to the animation and vfx people  it really blew our minds  a subtle hint of comedy  absolutely extrodinary fighting choreography  would have been a 9 if not for the fact that there were a few scenes that didn't make sense   like for instance  when sang chi meets his father why are they talking in english  talking in their own mother tongue would have been great  in the end it was an exceptional movie   ,Positive
935,after watching the eternal's flop few days ago i can say that this is waaaaaaay better movie  it is not as the movies from the infinity saga  but i liked it  for me  it is too much the expanded world  but probably this is the way to see new characters and progression in the mcu  again  after the eternals i can say that mcu is not getting the needed momentum to make us wait for the eventual endgame style movie to end the phase 4 we'll see  we'll see ,Positive
936,69/100shang chi is  at its core  a people pleasing marvel movie  nothing more  nothing less  due to this  there isn't really all too much to say about this one storywise  it was simple and unchallenging  following shang chi as he attempts to prevent the end of the world  standard fare for most action films  the characters and their motivations all feel flat  outside of shang chi and katy  who provide a fun duo for the first two acts of the film  as with almost every marvel film  it's swamped in cgi  leading to it being visually inseparable from the rest of the catalogue  the fight choreography felt fun  with the two types starkly contrasting: the cthd inspired duels  and the modern  almost dance like brawls  outside of a passing character appearance and a post credit scene  there is no real reference to the overall mcu  leaving me thinking this film would have worked better as a fully standalone one  especially for an otherwise relatively unknown character  my main complaint is with the story  and how little happened in the runtime  they could have developed characters more  they could have touched more on the 1000 years the father was alive and how it affected him  they could have put more into telling the story of the soul sucking dragon and where it is trapped  but none of this happens  this film is  yes  alright  but it had potential to be so much better i can't be arxed to paragraph this  so have this all in one big lump ,Positive
937,the mcu's newest movie has the same things the other movies in the series have by that i mean great humour  great action scenes  and just the fun factor that makes all of the movies so beloved  the film feels like it has a couple of 'acts'  and each has something else to offer  the action scenes are very fun to watch and the fight scenes are really well choreographed  there are a lots of nice looking locations and colors in the film  and it has a nice asian feel to it  there are also great quiet scenes between shaung and his family  the characters are great  shaung and his sister being warriors with troubled lives  their father being determined to bring back his wife back despite what his son says  and katy  trevor and morris are all really hilarious  also  the movie is just fun to watch  i largely reccomend it ,Positive
938,this movie is great  one if the best from marvel  9/10 legendary rings ,Positive
939,marvel origins story are amazing but this one breaks the line  the writing  the humor  the comedy everything is perfect here  the directors made all the best choices which made the movie incredible ,Positive
940,i thought it was a great hero movie  it developed the character as well as others and felt like the story was complete  this story was over and now it's time for the next ,Positive
941,a solid origin story for mcu's newest avenger if i were to summarize how this movie made me feel  i would say it was like a crossover of raya and the last dragon  crouching tiger hidden dragon and a mega blockbuster jackie chan film but with the never tiring humor of the marvel cinematic universe  for the first time in forever  i didn't need english subtitles for english conversations in an mcu film  thank god for asian americans haha i want to leave out simu liu and shang chi himself in this review because i think this movie is more about tony leung's character  the mandarin  than it is about shang chi  this movie's central themes are grief  loss  moving on and finding passion in life  all these are heavier and deeper with the mandarin than with shang chi  this film is like a beloved ancient asian tale brought to life  crafted with respect and participated by the probably the best people for their roles so many familiar faces appear in this movie  and it is always nice to remember which films in the franchise you saw some characters in and how they are all connected with each other i am so excited for what shang chi can offer from here on out to the rest of the mcu  asians really are winning with this representation in the avengers  this movie is a homage to many superhero fans who are asian  asian kids finally have superheroes in the mcu they can see themselves in ,Positive
942,alright i get it  if you're not a fan of the character you're not gonna like it but i've watched movies before where i had no clue who the character was and it was still great because those movies made me care for them i think the acting is pretty decent  the actors do a good job being funny and some of the action scenes are pretty awesome but that's already expected from a mcu production  my real issue with this movie is it's plot  it's a tale about a chinese warrior that doesn't use his abilities for sht even though he was raised to be a fighter and do something but instead he just runs away and hides in new york with this boring comic relief/love interest character  and leaves his sister behind not even caring about it  alright i can buy all that but where's his motivation?then suddenly a guy with a sword in his arms appears and steals his necklace and he starts to do something about it  wow what an amazing chinese hero let's give some applause   plus his dad/villain is totally forgettable  the whole relationship is poorly written  in one scene he says he's going to kill his dad and in the other he basically forgot about it  the dad doesn't have one scene of development  his character is weak af probably one of the worst antagonists in the mcu  the cgi dragons are pretty amazing but other than that it's just another formula marvel bull and totally forgettable ,Positive
943,i'm just in love with this movie it's so good it's a masterpiece it's so good it has great action scenes the villain is amazing simu is fantastic akwafina is amazing it has a great representation the female characters are incredible everything is great ,Positive
944,greatly done movie with great characters  the best part of this movie is it's action  beautiful visually and made to perfection  this is not only one of my new favourite marvel movies but also one of my favourite superhero movies ,Positive
945,it was such an awesome movie  something i would definitely watch again sometime  now this film is definitely one of my top 5 films  the storytelling was amazing from start to finish  the action scenes in this movie were very jackie chan/bruce lee stylish type of martial arts  loved this movie! 10/10 ,Positive
946,really entertaining movie  actors were great simu liu brought it big time he is excellent as the main character  awkwafina is hilarious and i wish she had more screen time  as far as marvel movies goes  it's not the best one but still very good ,Positive
947,this film   is just brilliant without spoilers there's not much for me to say overall 9/10 ,Positive
948,shang chi is arguably the most original and entertaining origin story that marvel's delivered in quite some time  coming from someone who's slowly starting to get superhero fatigue from both sides of the aisle  this one delivers  it's a spectacle  and has a family drama that feel's shakespearean at times  in many ways this is how i wanted the live action version of mulan to be ,Positive
949,trash  do not waste your time  beautifully filmed trash  you'd almost think the final battle was ripped from the never ending story  mystical crap  action sequences are a cgi mess  story is convoluted  acting is passable ,Positive
950,seriously marvel wtf?? why is it so difficult for you to make a good movie??? what's wrong??? classless and tasteless as always  why is it so bad why is it so bad???? why do you keep on disappointing us like this ,Negative
951,"kung fu hustle vs black panther vs guardians of the galaxy but not as funny vs raya
enjoyed watching but too predictable and not one i'll rewatch over and over like avengers or civil war ",Positive
952,the whole movie's done on computer  nothing makes sense  story is just some fantasy nonsense mixed with pop culture stuff  everything is predictable  everything is cliche  you just can directly skip to the action and you would lose nothing  it's fantasy cgi fest  characters are super weak  everyone loses focus or can change its character in a minute my god i miss real movies instead of these marvel superhero things once a month ,Positive
953,what do they expect? to be so woke i can instantly understand mandarin? not happening  had to turn cc  not what i singed up for on disney plus  i this a does not barther you go for it bla bla bla bla ,Neutral
954,this film isn't perfect  i felt like they honestly could have kept it going with the feel of the first half of the film and maybe save the more mystical special effects for a sequel  kind of felt like 2 movies jammed together  but regardless  both halves were great  i think the first half was a bit better and the ending got a bit jumbled with the cgi  but i feel like the more i watch it and am able to process everything the more i'll love it  all i know is i can't wait to watch it again  and i can't wait to see shang chi with the other mcu heroes  wenwu is one of the best mcu villains so far  maybe the best after thanos  the humor was fantastic and the bus scene is probably one of the best scenes in the mcu  choreography was brilliant  cinematography as well  i will say i wish they saved razor fist as a future villain (but then we wouldn't have gotten the insane bus scene)  and definitely wish they went all out for death dealer  or saved him for a sequel as well  i thought he was such a badass character that we only got to see the tip of the iceberg of his potential  super unique design to him  i do kind of wish shang chi had a superhero name of some sort  kind of throws me off that his marvel title is just his name  but i guess that's the case for thor and loki too  and some of the netflix heroes if you count them  anyways i'm really nitpicking now  but great mcu film  still feels pretty formulaic  but it's own thing at the same time ,Positive
955,this movie basically lacks all that can make a greate movie asian mythology is so rich  this move is not * story is boring * script is so thin  that even the actors looks realy stiff and bad * it is basically no fun * it feels like 3 5 hours long * cgi effects at times seems very bad and distracting * on top of that it is spiced up with modern day politics and it feels very forced time for a long pause marvel  to regroup  this is getting very bad ,Negative
956,great movie to bring renaissance to a fantasy kung fu movie genre  and it kept its asian roots in the story and characters  shang chi is a great movie for its mcu introduction  i haven't been in movie theaters for about 4 5 years  for this  i decided to go out and see in movie theaters  and i'm happy that i did ,Positive
957,**spoilers for shang chi and iron man 3**the mandarin is one of marvels most iconic vilains  he is the arch enemy of iron man  like joker is the arch enemy of batman  in iron man 3  they made a total joke of the mandarin  a fine actor  ben kingsley  was wasted for a bad caricature of mandarin the shang chi movie ruins the mandarin again  because this movie was made by left wing liberals who preach political correctness  because they wanted to avoid anything which might be offensive or racist  let me ask you  what is racist about an asian man wearing traditional asian clothes? and what is racist about an asian man with long hair and beard? exactly  absolutely nothing  that's how the mandarin looks like in the comicbooks  in this movie  he has short hair  western everyday clothes  looking like a random regular guy (boring)  totally different name  also  in the comicbooks  each of his rings has its own power  that means ten different powers  in this movie  all rings have the same power  so not even that is done right  in conclusion  this mandarin has nothing to do with the original by the way  this movie ruins shang chi  too  he gets god like powers  he could defeat the mighty thor  why??? shang chi is a tribute to bruce lee  he doesn't have superpowers  martial arts is his skill  why not making great martial arts movies with shang chi instead of cgi superpower blockbuster stuff?people who gave high ratings for this movie don't know the source material  so they cannot judge ,Positive
958,visually stunning  awesome fight scenes  many easter eggs ,Positive
959,i loved it  i was very surprised  i had no expectations going in  best fight scenes in an mcu movie so far  surprisingly emotional for an marvel movie  i loved the special effects  it was very funny but not as funny as the other movies  looking forward to see shang chi in the future ,Positive
960,i had very few expectations from this one  given the fact that it was an origin story with a character i know zero facts about  but let me say this  it competes with the avengers movies when comes to cinematography  visuals and action sequences by far the best marvel movie in the recent years  that puts many titles from its portfolio to shame the visuals are a blast  a true eye candy experience  there are a lot of new elements that marvel seemed to experience with and it worked out perfectly  the choreography is spot on  as the fighting sequences are among the best i've seen  and combined with a good score  it turns out to be a very enjoyable seeing on the big screen  i think it's mandatory to watch shang chi on the biggest screen you can get to ,Positive
961,i wasn't really excited about mcu when phase 4 was announced  but even then there were some things i was excited about and this movie wasn't one of those things  however  i liked it i wasn't disappointed like i was with black widow which massacred taskmaster so bad it reminded me a lot of black panther  non white foreign protagonist  modern music and annoying sidekick but here is a twist  this movie does a way better job than black panther humor was funnier  katy didn't say anything cringe  we got real mandarin and cgi battle didn't feel like ps2 cutscene if you want to watch an mcu movie from phase 4 before no way home comes out  watch this also  eternals was awkward ,Negative
962,usual kung fu fantasy action     all been done before as has the story line     boring waste of money and time  this constant response working of the same story lines using the same themes show that commercial film making is in a very narrow cul de sac   ,Negative
963,everybody was kung fu fighting for 2 straight hours and it´s just bad it starts okay  then it just gets worse by the minute if this is the new direction marvel is headed  then it´s just sad really a bad movie and the story is rubbish  acting is bad and the best thing is that i saw it for free ,Negative
964,one of the best marvel movies in a decade  cinematography acting jokes background score everything is on point according to story scene & actors action scenes hand to hand combat is on another level ,Positive
965,movie is a great treat for all the fans  this reminded us of last marvel magic in theatre  but here is a twist  this one was fresh and different with some sad themes the plot is fine but the  action & the cgi dominated this movie  its was so good and really its the strength of marvel studios and they have used it in a great way  lots of astonishing scenes and visuals are there which ll blow your mind casting and performance were also great  awkwafina killed her role  simu was also great  but tony as the mandarian was the best  movie is little fast paced because they wanted to show much and you can't show everything in just 2 hours but it was great to back at cinema along with this movie   ,Positive
966,at first glance  shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is emotional  engaging and action packed  the truth is that there's so much more behind the surface  it is a story of self discovery  full of great character arcs  glorious fight scenes and dynamic choreography  simu liu really shines as the main character: he brings so much charm to the role that it's easy to grow fond of him  the director  destin daniel cretton  manages to create a new mythology  both inspired by the comics and the chinese tradition  the visual effects are great  even outstanding during certain moments  as well as the concept design of all the mythical creatures  finally  the music really meshes amazingly with the scenes  especially when there's more action and emotion  a new modern superhero has arrived and he's ready to deliver some punches  this movie really pulls off a great origin story that proves  once again  the endless possibilities the marvel cinematic universe has yet to offer ,Positive
967,"i have probably counted at least 5 martial arts movies  rolled up into this movie!!which is pretty good too see if marvel & kevin fegie  do a cross over with another marvel movie   
that would pretty awesome to see shang chi  evolve into a much better character   ",Positive
968,i knew that the movie is actually good before watching it   before i watch it i knew that i will give it 7 5   it's actually gorgeous with the visual effects and the fighting scenes was awesome and the music was good   i recommend watching it even if you didn't saw the last movies   there is a couple minutes i got bored in but the action is back after   at the end shang chi is very good movie for the eyes and fighting scenes are great ,Positive
969,the first part of the first act is awkward due to the inclusion of awkwafina  while i enjoy her in many other roles  her character here is executed poorly  sometimes the scene calls for her to react with a little more reality  a little more urgency but you can tell she's staring at green tennis ball  this pops up through the rest of the movie it just didn't hit the emotional marks enough for me to care  the ending fell in to the usual tropes of too much on screen mayhem it is gorgeous  the choreography is spectacular  it's still a fun spectacleit may  like other mcu flicks  grow on me with repeated viewings ,Positive
970,it is not many times that you come out of the cinema with your friends and laugh about how bad a movie is but here we are  this is the lowest of the low and this franchise has become nothing but a joke  katy is the worst character in cinema history just shut up please jar jar 2 0  this is a disgrace to my eyes and dc is clear i see that now  if you like this movie you have problems ,Negative
971,what began as a middling marvel film was taken up a few notches thanks to some well done fight choreography and heart  i would have rated this a 9  however  awkwafina's acting and/or character wasn't needed past the first act  she seemed out of place and shoehorned in much of the film  her voice and presence was annoying  moreover  the controversy surrounding her was a distraction though warranted  i really hope she isn't brought back ,Negative
972,"where to start  i'll start by saying the choreography is the best in any movie ever made  easily  the cinematography and colouring is also effing fantastic  simu pulled off a fantastic performance of amazing martial arts  a goofy dude who wasn't annoying  and pulled off emotional scenes very well  cgi was fantastic  the motivations for the plot were as well  i don't think it's perfect because there were some pacing issues  i felt a little bored in the third act for some reason  maybe it was a result of being tired to be honest so that's not they're fault  great movie tiny tiny spoiler about post credit scenes
but i did leave with a bad taste in my mouth because the critics said the post credit scenes were endgame level hype and i was so excited  expected tobey and/or andrew  or some x men  spoiler alert  not even close  wasn't that good  so that is not the movies fault  just lower your credit scene expectations if you're freaking out about it ",Positive
973,blockbuster in block capital letters  what a movie  amazing experience and great cgi ,Positive
974,this movie is easily in my top 5 favorite mcu movies!!,Positive
975,cg in this movie looks so good  their acting performances made me enjoy it  however  i want to watch this movie because tony leung  he is so talented and charming  i think the scenes in the end was too less for him  it's definitely better if the director have put more detail of emotional scenes ,Positive
976,it was ok  nothing new  but that's what marvel does  churns out the same story over an over ,Positive
977,this movie is amazing!! scenes are incredibily beautiful  fighting scenes are bomb  acting is great  plot is great as well  even the casting overall was pretty good it was one of the best solo marvel movies and definetely the best marvel's debut so far ,Positive
978,great visual at second half reminded me kong  godzilla vs kong  avatar and some recent chinese movies  it has some of the best actions scenes in mcu ,Positive
979,the friend was annoying and unimportant to the story altogether  her supportive scenes could've been substituted with the sister  and her comedic scenes with the old mandarin the villain at the end was barely explained and described as overly powerful    but why? should've went smaller scale for an origin story ,Negative
980,wow  this movie was honestly a lot better than i thought it'd be  the action was well done  had good humor  and had a good story with great cgi in it  i was engaged throughout it  the acting was good and believable  especially by the antagonist  i'm impressed and proved wrong  i didn't expect a movie of this level  not impressed by the soundtrack  but that doesn't take away much from the experience ,Positive
981,was excepting something new from marvel this time around but shang chi still feels like its brought down by the marvel formula  the action scenes are definitly a strong highlight along with the acting  i like a lot of the camera moves and the dynamic colours and costume design make this movie stand out among the other mcu films  technically this is a massive achivment but sadly the story does not hold up  as the movie goes on the story gets weaker and weaker until it becomes a giant cgi fest like every other superhero movie ever  there is obviously a lot of heart and talent that went into this project but the mcu is turning 13 years old now and we are still using this same repetitive formula shout out to the guy that looked like morgan freeman he was the real star of the show ,Negative
982,"i'm a strong mcu fan and i'm one of those who enjoy almost everything out there  if there's a bad movie that's fun i'm gonna enjoy it anyway  and i've enjoyed shang chi  and i've laughed  many times the problem is    i don't know  it doesn't really feel like a marvel one to me  which doesn't need to be a bad thing but in this case  at least for me  it's not an advantage  it feels like an average chinese ""kung fu + over fantastic asian mithology"" one  gosh  they spend at least the first 10 to 15 minutes of the movie speaking chinese  true  true  the trailer already sold us that style  but it's way further than what the trailer shows  i'm not a particular fan of that style of movies myself but i did give it a go because    well  you know  it's marvel  but it doesn't feel like marvel  and i only believed that it is because of one small cameo in the middle of the movie  because of the last scene and because of the middle credits one that's the thing  if shang chi wasn't a marvel one  i don't believe i'd seen it at all because  as i said  chinese fantasy kung fu movies are not my thing  so i guess that's on me but yeah  it was fun nevertheless ",Positive
983,bad acting  generic boring marvel story  nothing but cgi and not their best effort with cgi either this is in the captain marvel  thor 2  iron man 2 & 3  etc range i'm sure his character will be more fun when they have a team up movie or the next avengers movie but this was mediocre and the 4 rating is also effective by the hype and praise this movie received  i don't get it at all ,Positive
984,"watched shang chi and the ten rings   despite the movie title sounding like one of those 1940s black and white ""detective dee and the    "" types  the film is visually stunning: stunning scenery  magical creatures  gorgeous costumes  no holds barred fight scenes that are as much dancing as fighting  you name it i do have issues  however  the first is that i think marvel was so worried about offending china or the chinese people that the film comes across as very safe  far too much on its dignity  if the film were a job interview  it would have been for the position of senior vice president at the chinese equivalent of the louvre  even akwafina  who i usually count on to deliver a raunchy belly laugh of a good time  was very composed and restrained i'm also wondering why they bothered including shang chi's sister  she doesn't really *do* anything except be moody and resentful for the majority of the film  even in the after scene  she's not there  as far as i can tell  the entire point of her inclusion in the film is to get shang chi to macau (bonus points for it not being the overused hong kong or singapore!) dignity or not  there was plenty of opportunity where they could have upped the humour quotient  the chinese people are dignified   famous for it   but they also have a ribald and sophisticated sense of humour  i would have *loved* to see sly digs at western culture  more commentary on differences between east and west (you can't tell me a guy spends his life in an isolated chinese compound or in the states then just seamlessly segues to macau's urban lifestyle!)  that kind of thing   more than the stereotypical ""when are you getting married? when are you going to get a real job?"" conversation  basically  they could have really *done* something with this movie  over and above a superhero story one thing i *really* want to see is a guide to the creatures we see in the film  they are so beautifully rendered! the fu dogs  for example   i was mesmerized watching the tiny little movements   ear flicks  muscle twitches as if reacting to a bug bite  the movement of the fur and mane: magnificent! but there were so many others i have no clue what they were other than they looked like chinese mythological creatures and i would love to know more about them ",Positive
985,awaited and received  the first asian superhero to cover at least some of the comic book covers the film is more suitable for phase 2 or phase 3 but not as delayed as black widow actor simu liu has a lot of charisma and i hope his changes and seriousness will be more visible in the future  because physical preparation looks strong brightly marked trio   tony leung chiu wai  fala chen  meng'er zhang reflects the best balance between the characters but     awkwafina looks completely cheap and more promotional than a serious character the film looks fantastic and startling visually  the story is somewhat simplified but i hope it will be deepened in the future  so the time is really short and you can enjoy the film in full  so i can strongly recommend marvel to the fans of the film  i saw 2 dragons in most of the movie posters  i thought only because of the commercials but they look stunning and have a much deeper start to this film than the supporting characters  here only a small detail the film itself is a lot of action  with a variety of fighting scenes  so you can feel a big difference from the whole marvel movie  ,Positive
986,"amazing choreography  incredible acting by the core cast  one of the few movies where you see so much heart in the main ""villain""   can't recommend this enough ",Positive
987,shang chi is a great flike from mcu not actually as best as black widow for me but shang chi is a movie with highly lovable and strongly performing actors specially legendary mischell(who is mostly a bad ass in most action movies)   simu liu  funny one awkafina  tony all were perfect also the plot humor  cgi  action sequence also traditional impact of chinese society (at some part it was promoted even though it had some changes with the transportation system the modernized cars) i loved it the antagonist also connected to the plot and fitted well looking forward for sequel !!  i highly recommend it cause it is beautifully made i would be glad to see shang chi with the other mcu heroes avengers    ,Positive
988,"shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is the 25th mcu (marvel cinematic universe) movie which also has the 1st major asian representation in the mcu i loved the film because it had an amazing story filled with a lot of elegant  eye pleasing scenes and super awesome crazy action scenes such as the bus fight  the movie also includes amazing martial art techniques and beautiful chinese things too this film doesn't have recognizable adult stuff and very violent action scenes as many of the previous mcu productions had  which makes the film  ""shang chi"" suitable even for younger kids like age 10  i didn't even feel the time passing by when i was watching this film because the story had an amazing flow with the stuff i mentioned before  i can't say anything else about the movie as i might include spoilers shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is an amazing  beautiful  action packed movie for the start of major asian representations in the mcu ",Positive
989,"this should be considered an animated film based on the amount of terrible cartoon like cgi utilized  from ""floppy"" animation used in place of human stunt people for many of the fight scenes (sorry  but martial arts are a lot less impressive when there are no actual people involved) to the terrible avatar looking backgrounds and even cars / buses  for the amount of money put into a film like this i would hope the effects would be better than an episode of game of thrones  but instead they looked like the matrix part 2  all of the actors involved were fantastic   when it was actually them  not a cgi stand in  but the story was all over the place  the villain(?) made no sense  i honestly have no idea what the hell was going on in the last half hour compared to the first hour  this movie was a mess all around  and compared to other mcu films feels like a total cluster f  definitely the worst movie i've seen this year  possibly in the last 10 years ",Negative
990,this movie is pure insult in first 10 minutes alone  awful cgi  just ridiculous  bullshido kung fu nonsense  blant bmw commercial  autotune mumble rap ,Negative
991,"if the first three entries of phase four are anything to go by  endgame was more prophetic than it was meant to be along with the ok black widow  the messy and boring eternals  shang chi serves as another middling entry into the mcu whilst the cast are by and large fine and some of the action is fine  at no point does this film do anything we haven't seen before  more than once the film also suffers from no genuine feeling of jeopardy which isn't unusual in the mcu but when a new character is in the middle of such heavily choreographed scenes which follow typical mcu action scene beats  it's hard to care what happens the fantasy element towards the end changes the tone slightly but it is really bland and cheesy  sickly sweet disney script writers seem to have their fingerprints all over it  again this reliance on a giant cgi fest of a last act peppered with cannon fodder monsters and slow mo shots between the main characters as they are ""in danger"" was played out a long time ago it seems as though many have enjoyed it though  everyone is different but anyone who has seen half a dozen mcu films will have seen this movie before ",Positive
992,well definitely the best production by marvel following endgame  an absolute treat to watch  the main attraction is obviously the amazing fight sequence that's up there with the best fight scenes of mcu  and also the background music is perfectly fitting to the tone and setting of the film  what many might think that the plotline does not have enough depth  but i'd beg to differ as the way they've changed the shang chi character  introducing his father as the wielder of the ten rings and changing the power of the rings altogether is an amazing approach itself  the merging of different components and changing the storyline from the comics has been common in the mcu but none of them is as unique as shang chi  i'd say if they brought the original shang chi from the comics  then it would've been a mediocre movie  but they made every character unique  even the villain has a backstory to which everyone can relate  the fight sequences give goosebumps everytime i watch 'em  can't wait for the sequel!!!,Positive
993,all in all it was a good marvel movie  not a great one  but still very good and very entertaining  shaun and katy were a great best buds duo with some fun interactions  ben kingsley's reprise as the mandarin was hysterical  he's got such range and doesn't take himself too seriously and that makes him perfect great fight scenes  ok origin story  but a little predictable unfortunately hopefully the next movie will get a little more attention to keeping the audience guessing at least a little watch and enjoy  even if you see it coming ,Positive
994,i can't do justice to the injustice done to katie and razorfist in writing     just watch the released deleted scenes for this film  in return for losing a couple of small character arcs we got in return a couple of one dimensional characters ,Negative
995,yet to watch the eternals and the new crop of characters into the mcu  but this is one i would definitely look forward to going forward ! wonderful cgi apart   a comprehensive origin movie that blends well into the mcu ,Positive
996,there were a couple of areas where i'm like noooo do somethingggg  but i think that comes with every human and super human  faults and emotional pitfalls that create it to be more realistic to an extent  as someone who understands the desire of wanting someone who is gone back  not saying or doing the right thing at certain moments  and family issues i get it all  but sometimes i just needed it to move a different way than it was  as an asian american though i love to see the representation! would have love to see even more new asian actors  excited for what is to come!,Positive
997,this is not even close to what the shang chi comic story line was where is the marvel comic shang chi character and at least some parts of that story line?this is one of the greatest epic fails ever made by the mcu so far ,Positive
998,"i watched a few marvel movies for the humor and action  and they were never ""great"" movies to me  so i was expecting to like it but nothing else in the first few minutes the narrator only speaks chinese with subtitles  which is a change from the usual immediate switch to english  at the first fighting scene i noticed how cool the music was  it's a bit like dubstep? but it really works with the scenery  morgan freeman's small role made me laugh  i didn't expect him there i was also not expecting to see some things that were slightly mentioned during the movie  i really thought they were gonna keep it mysterious even though it's marvel i'm glad the comic relief characters weren't all there all the time  weren't the only ones being funny  and more importantly played a big role in the story  that was very pleasant of course the acting was great too  and the sad scenes were believable  i rarely see a main character tearing up  i wish they could cry like a normal human would  a lot of movies suffer from the badass blank face protagonist  this wasn't totally the case here big pro is the lack of forced romance  kissing and whatever  i hate that stuff  the girl always falls in love with the guy but not here (or it's not shown)  though the parents shouldn't have fallen in love either by my standards
the only bit of blood in the movie was really fake looking  but the other 3d animated made up for itone thing i'm not happy about is how confusing some action scenes are  no idea what's going on  or where the protagonist is going  it slows down for the important hits  but those are typical marvel action scenes i also didn't like that the sister was overshadowed and that she forgave so easily this is closer to a 10 than a 9 so i gave 10  i'm just so happy i felt something while watching a movie  it's been so long!",Positive
999,was looking forward to seeing this  thought tying shang chi to the ten rings was an interesting twist for a character who traditionally has no powers  so much random  why is wong training the abomination? who cares it's funny even if it makes no sense  random creature in cell can find the way to the magical land? very lazy writing  why did the father think he could take over a land of warriors and magical creatures when just one of them kicked his butt? who knows  akwafina is kind of annoying and that shot at the end was so telegraphed and cringe  why did wong bring her along at the end? who knows ,Positive
1000,great cinematic pleasure in this one from start to finish  bar the music choices in the film an expertly written  directed and portraid  makes this a very enjoyable experience i hope there will be more to come of this style of movie making  because this was worthy of its praise well done to all involved!,Positive
1001,"the fight choreography  stunts & sfx teams definitely carry this movie  they all did a fantastic job  story wise  i wish they would have either committed to making sc a new ip (is that illegal to do now?) or stuck to the original story butchered in iron man about the mandarin & 10 rings rings of power  he had a giant freakin godzilla lizard named fing fang foom  and that was awesome(sometimes it's the simple things in life that are meaningful) the movie gets off the ground pretty quickly and stays pretty engaging up until about the 1:15 mark  then takes a bit of a dive going over backstory  it eventually picks back up again with some battle scenes  and then does absolutely everything in its power to ruin your previous 2 hours with the final 5 minutes & mid/post credits scenes  they just couldn't let it go out on a not stupid note the acting was pretty limited  director: ""everyone just act kinda stoic  maybe stare into the middle distance a bit  great! except you awkwardfina  you say everything that crosses you mind  there's nothing you can say that isn't hilarious!"" awk is like the jar jar binks of this movie  like maybe she heard ""outlandish sidekick""  saw ""rush hour"" and thought  ""so do my best chris tucker    got it!""  ronnie acts like himself all in all  a pretty enjoyable & forgettable film  as far as marvel/disney+ goes  this is arguably the best thing they've put out since end game  definitely better than black widow  wandavision  falcon  hawkeye  what if    the politics behind this movie are pretty hilarious  so maybe look up the behind the scenes drama during the slow part in the middle ",Positive
1002,waaay too much hype  sorry but the movie felt more like a kungfu movie rather than a marvel movie  if it it wasn't for the cameos in the end i would have never known  acting was done well but i wasn't overly impressed ,Positive
1003,loved the action sequences & charectors  at the end story feels so simple & old  that being said  i'm really looking forward to the upcoming marvel films to see how this charector gonna evolve ,Positive
1004,i appreciate the fight scene  the visual is good  moves better than the iron fist  overhype  overpowered  the show turn into harry potter in one night  unneceseray and unfit jokes  lazy writng ,Positive
1005,i've just come out of the cinema and i'm in awe of how beautiful this movie was  it was visually stunning: rich in colour and graphics  the costumes  cinematography and set were outstanding  the music was wonderful  there were funny moments  heart felt moments and edge of your seat moments  everything that a marvel movie should be and more  it made me so happy to see the asian community finally being represented in the marvel universe  acting was insane  i absolutely love akwafina  go and watch this at the cinema if you can  it is so worth it to see the beauty on the big screen ,Positive
1006,"i was excited to see this film even before it materialized into actual being  i remember thinking  ""this is going to be the next black panther experience   but with asian representation!!!!""  i was so pumped to meet shang chi and watch his story unfold  and then   it got here  and i saw it yesterday and was so so so disappointed  i found story telling bland and cgi filled  the action meh  dialogue rehashed from other films (especially the humor)  and most of the characters one dimensional and non interesting (especially shang)   but there was some heart in this movie  the marvel movies at least have that at the end of the day  even the misses have something good about it  for most of the thor movies it was loki  for captain america's first film it was cap's overall goodness  and for black widow it was the introduction of her not so sister  i found this movie heart to be none other than   the mother  yes  i'm going to write that fala chen who played the mother of shang chi is the only great part about this film  honestly  she should have been shang chi herself and should be in the mcu alone  because she stole the show  i wish we could have just gotten her story and her character  because it was way more interesting than anything that this film was trying to do  so  i feel like i didn't waste my money buying a ticket because i at least got to fall in love with the mother character and her story  but other than that  i'd say this was a miss overall and is not giving phase four a hopeful look for the future :/",Positive
1007,sorry  this was a bag of mixed blessings for me despite some great cinematic moments  it felt like that marvel is moving towards movies like the sw the last jedi category  and i really did not like the katty character ,Positive
1008,weirdest scouse accent i've ever heard  almost woke up out of distaste  worst accent in a film award  not even northern ffs!unfortunately didn't follow most of the film  i'm unable to read white on black due to a disability and sadly don't speak mandarin  what i did follow was unbelievably boring marvel really is dead to me pre end game i was such a massive fan  its all gone downhill since ,Negative
1009,i watched this movie after twitter was claiming it to be the best movie ever  so i went with high expectations  after watching what i found is movie was mediocre at best  the cgi was great but apart from it everything is just ok at the best  i didn't connect with any character at all  to be honest wait for the film to come on streaming services  not worth it to go to the cinema ,Positive
1010,the accents were pretty bad in this movie  and i'm talking about the english accents; they were very forced and honestly the whole movie should have just been in chinese  that would have been 10x better  the poor english speaking kind of threw off a lot of lines for me  making the lines in english feel forced and cringey  it was just super random too  like in the most randomest times  the movie was also a little boring  and the plot was a little forced as well  but the ending was pretty predictable yet good  honest rating for the whole thing a 5/10  i liked awkwifina's (forgive me if i spelled her name wrong) part in the movie ,Positive
1011,i'm a sucker for mythical creatures and fluid fight scenes; this movie had both  the two main characters were very likeable as well this is basically a marvel/kung fu/fantasy mashup  it's not anything new but it is a good time ,Positive
1012,i really  really enjoyed the movie  the fight scenes in particular  as a fan of old school kung fu movies and the way they design the fighting scenes to look was just my cup of tea  that built up and exceled when the super hero fighting took place as well  it was just fighting perfection for me the soundtrack of this movie was off the charts  starting from the opening scene  to the train fight scene and throughout now the visuals    they were    stunning humour was well placed and got a giggle or two out of the whole cinema  especially with trevor  hahah if it had just a biiiiiit of more depth in the story it would be a 10/10 ,Positive
1013,entertaining movie   worth it   the bus scene   oh boy   on loop   overall visual treat   neat cgi and enjoyable marvel movie   you will love it   don't miss it ,Positive
1014,thoroughly enjoyed the movie  very well made  full of action  comedy  emotion!,Positive
1015,though this film had quite lame and straightforward storyline but it's amazing direction  fantastic acting by all the cast members  beautiful visuals and cgi work  action sequences and the balance between humor and emotion makes it 10 times better film and a treat for marvel fans  it carries a great potential for the future of the mcu  for me this is the best film of 2021 until now and i truly enjoyed it and hope to see shang chi more in the mcu ,Positive
1016,incredible  everything from the cinematography to the storyline to the characters to the choreography this movie has it all  every character has a purpose  and the actors absolutely killed it  easily in the top 5 marvel movies  and the post credits scenes were great as well ,Positive
1017,i'm not gonna to lie  i wasn't excited for this movie  the first teaser was underwhelming and the official trailer didn't get me hooked either  either way i'm a huge mcu and marvel fan so i decided to go watch it either way  it was amazing  the film was only 2+ hours but it contained soo much  the setting changed so much  the actors did a great job  the cinematography was great and cgi was spot on  the only complaint is that the movie felt very cringe ish at some times  especially during the first 10 minutes  but the movie gradually got better  still having some cringey scenes during the run  i know some people have their complaints on awkwafina but she really did a great job  simu liu's character was lacking at times though but i'd definitely say he has one of the best debut characters in terms of personality *and why people are reviewing this now is because it was released on september 1th in a few countries also spoiler  abomination's character only did a very brief appearance  it was so brief so that i was unable to even film him also  we have another bad guy who will show up later in the mcu ;),Positive
1018,"   getting more and more boring  childish and too much ""over the top fantasy"" with time it starts as a great martial arts movie  with humor  good acting  great fight and action scenes but in the second half of the movie it loses its humor  i got bored several times and the fantasy is just getting too much  it turns to a children's movie  i was so bored and annoyed of this bad twist that i almost didn't finish the movie  it lost me completely  what a pity!first half: 10/10
second half: 0/10 ",Positive
1019,shang chi is an emotional roller coaster  using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain  the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super heroic dramatics  destin daniel cretton creates a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be  however prepared you feel  you are not ready for the villain  mandarin   shang chi is stunning  hilarious and heartbreaking and one of the best action set pieces of this year which is the bus scene ,Positive
1020,i just finished watching this and all i can say is this movie is soo unique  from the action to the atmosphere it just made this experience so great words can't even explain  i'm so eager to see what marvel has in store for us next!,Positive
1021,this is a beautiful film  there are some spectacular shots that you can tell are inspired by classes chinese cinema  wide shots of beautiful landscapes with real martial artists make you feel  sometimes  like you truly aren't just watching another marvel movie  which even the best marvel films struggle with the story is good  though it does too often rely on the standard marvel plot points that are in almost all of these movies  but the film is truly lifted up by its incredible action  this is hands down the best action in the mcu  and after seeing black widow  which was terrible  cutting every half second during fights  this film utilizing wide shots and long takes was a breath of fresh air  there's a lot to love here and if it wasn't for some of the odd choices and the humor  which was about 50/50 hit or miss for me  then this would be a 10 star film  it's definitely worth watching ,Positive
1022,if it wasn't for the amazing cinematography i'd give it a 9  one of the most beautiful films i've ever seen  great action and set up good new character  overall  a breath of fresh air  felt unique  enjoyed ,Positive
1023,marvel keeps making better movies! this marvel era is marvelous (pun intended) first the series  then the black widow movie and now this! this movie has such lovable characters  the hero shaun doesn't have a hero complex like iron man  and the women who play in the movies are all different  in the beginning of marvel women (in my opinion) were displayed as either a strong power woman or a sex object  here the women are just themselfs  the storyline is something new for me  i never heard about these stories and legends before  but now i plan to do that way more often  it was a little disappointing that all the 'good' main characters survived without a scratch  of course i am happy that they will return in these movies in the future  but it makes it less dramatic and realistic  still it is a funny movie with a great storyline and i cant even begin to mention how great the visuals were and the special effects  one of the best marvel movies for sure!,Positive
1024,the music was soo good  the fighting scenes were great they were flowing like a poem  the story was there  the acting was there  one of the best marvel movie and noone expected it ,Positive
1025,cretton is an amazing director  and he like totally proves it here once again  i love the way he tells stories  and shang chi is finally not just like every other mindless disney film of their new big franchises  the action is worth it compared to other marvel films  and the acting is to be expected as great considering at least disney knows how to hire actors  albeit they don't let people often tell real stories  go watch this! somewhere! anywhere! everywhere!,Positive
1026,i'm a big time marvel fan and would have anyway rated the movie good  but i genuinely loved the movie and instantly rewatched which i rarely do given the plethora of content available these days i would even rate the movie better then endgame  it has more action and less talking ,Positive
1027,"the film ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" is quite dynamic  there are a lot of special effects the film combines science fiction  fantasy  action  adventure  i like such films  because you immediately tune in to miracles and the unreality of events the elements of humor in the film are also visible  there are funny moments the plot of the film is interesting  in my spirit  the only thing missing was a smoother transition of an ordinary fighter into a superhero  as the reincarnation happened quickly the film is directed by destin daniel cretton  the film itself is from the usa and australia  marvel studios  the film lasts more than two hours  but it looks in one breath the plot jumps into the past in periods  revealing the biography of the hero summing up  i want to say the film was very interesting to watch and not boring  a very beautiful fairy tale movie  there was a little lack of plot revealing moments  though then it would have stretched for all three hours  if not more  but for me it would have been better to let it stretch therefore   i advise you to look !",Positive
1028,"the beginning starts off with a beautiful dance fight scene between the antagonist and the protagonist's mother  the fighting choreography on the train scene was brilliant and alluring to watch  i even managed to chuckle when one of the passengers started to twitch stream the fight  easily the best fight in the movie  the movie starts to become stupid to watch once the main protagonists and his friend reaches his sister's battle arena  the plot plummets once they start preparing you with meaningless lore to the fantasy world and weak characters that feel like characters from a pokémon rpg  the final fight was weak  the characters  the land  everything was super colorful that it really felt like i was watching ""rava: the last dragon""  it's supposed to be a battle or civil war between family  people are supposed to die  but nope there's no tension here because why would there be  look at the color on that dragon and the characters weapons  why would i think that  we are constantly reminded that it's a disney film the story was somewhat interesting to see through the backstory of the father  son  and daughter  it would've been more interesting if they attempted to show the main protagonists try to do his fathers wishes to assassinate his target and decides at the last minute not to do it  as well the story could've focused more on the father and the son like a duality  maybe like how the father came into power again rebuilding his yakuza army  maybe like the same way the 1st spider man movie did with osborn and peter this movie was disappointing  better than eternals though and it is worth to watch but only a 1/3 of the way through  do not buy this movie or watch on your own  good family movie ",Positive
1029,it is rare that one would see a movie as bad as shang chi  the script is extremely lazy  the cliches abound  the actors seem to take pride in being horrible  the lack of imagination or even care is just unprecedented  why did anyone make this movie?,Negative
1030,i loved this movie  marvel characters woven into a breathtaking movie  i loved that they included some of the chinese mythical creatures in the land of ta lo  modern to mythical mix played well  a cinematic pleasure ,Positive
1031,"overall  i really liked the film  but i don't think it's what the reviews are making it to be  definitely one of the most over praised ever  in my opinion let's start with the things i liked  and this is definitely the beginning  the first act  mandarin's brutal battle with the armies hints at the epic and great effects that await us and the power of the rings  also  the director manages to introduce us to the main characters   shang chi and katie and the great chemistry between them  with very few and correctly shot scenes  the two radiate a very pleasant warmth and you really feel their friendship  we also witness two of the best made battle scenes i've seen in a movie  the one on the bus and on the scaffolding around the skyscraper  maybe that's where the problem is rooted and the film gets a little underwhelming over time  because these scenes were so good that nothing could reach them afterwards  especially the cg fest  which turned out to be the finale another plus i can point out  as a consequence of the above is the directing itself  the cinematography and the music  the film looks and is shot beautifully  colorful when needed  without overdoing it  the same with the gloomy scenes (which makes me angry that i had to wear the damn 3d glasses again)  scenes inspired by old chinese classics such as ""hero""  ""house of the flying daggers"" and ""tiger and dragon"" were great  poetic and with enough respect for these old classics! the battle scenes were also an absolute peak and as i said   the scaffolding scene can be a master class on how to shoot one  the music also contributed very nicely with the light chill beats  perfectly complementing the urban scenes and the epic asian notes included in the fairytale segments  some of the acting surprised me a little   most were good  especially tony leung as the father  and  would you believe it   aquafina or whatever that name is  i didn't expect her to surprise me so pleasantly at all  but i liked her even more than the main guy simu  who was honestly wooden at times  despite his charisma  congratulations to the actress who played shong chi's mother  she was wonderful  i will also mention the relatively funny cameo from a rather controversial character that we remember from iron man 3 :)and in this line of thought   to say the things that did not work for me  namely  the fairy tale / fantasy part  as well as the seriously slugish second act  where i think they went too far with the flashbacks  the exposition and the dramatization  i don't know  maybe the problem is in me  but as things started to move into the dimension of fairy tales and fantasy  somehow that took me out of the movie  it came to me too abruptly and unexpectedly to be so made up  especially after the super well done scenes happening on earth  also  when the whole mystery began to unfold  there were too long scenes with silence  dramatic looks  explanations  exposure  flashbacks  that started to lose me a little and roll my eyes the final act  unfortunately  is a typical marvel / superhero epic with a bit too much monsters  creatures and fiction that i could handle  i understand that the film is a cultural phenomenon  especially for china  and they wanted to weave culture  mythology  legends into one  but even though we have witnessed all sorts of cosmic and fantastic wonders in this universe   something about these dragons and wonders took me out slightly from the movie  i would accept them much better in animated / comic form however  the very way it ends  where things became more grounded again and even the characters explained with self irony and joked about what happened  was great and definitely raised my rating slightly  also the fantastic mid credit scene after all that has been said  it is very difficult for me to find a correct assessment of the film  on the one hand  seven is not enough for me  eight is too much for me  so i nail it to * 7 5 / 10 *",Positive
1032,very chinese propaganda movie   the man has eternal power and living through the ages still the only thing on his mind is america hayaaa such a lizard ,Negative
1033,i'd like to write an in depth review but i feel like there's not enough to these movies for that  they just feel like everything else if you've seen one of these movies recently you have an idea of what you're in for  if you're into that you'll enjoy it  if you're burnt out on movies feeling the same and characters sounding the same and acting the same and being very the same it will be just another disney movie in 2021 to kill 2 hours with and get nothing out of i've been watching chinese action stars since i was a child  i'm aware of the main actors comments about not being aware of chinese heroes before himself somehow because he's done zero research and doesn't enjoy classic cinema in his own time     and is a 2021 person and wants to just say things  virtue signaling i believe it's called   but i'd recommend he check some of those movies out instead as they're much more interesting ,Positive
1034,"i am surprised all those ""suspicious"" good review  i m falling asleep and can't even pay attention most of the time  somehow the mandarin in the movie is weird  is like watching an incrediblely old chinese movie trying to hit international with a bunch of westerners in the movie  this is by far the worst of mcu movies    some of the chinese cast doesn't even speak mandarin/english as mother language  the languages in the movies is quite irritating while they keep swapping in between both languages or may be marvel doesn't care the way they speak does effect the experience while the audience watch it  i guess the best scene is just the action part and the cg without anyone talking    ",Positive
1035,so good! i loved it  exciting  funny  visually stunning  likeable characters  amazing action sequences  i recommend it!!,Positive
1036,the marvel universe has excelled here    pure pure brilliance ! so good !,Positive
1037,marvel had a huge opportunity to make this so much bigger and better than just a premise movie beautiful cinematography and the choreography was more than just stunt work  acting a little rough here and there  the protagonist actor did a pretty good job though  that dry mcu humor we've grown to see didn't quite hit  i know a lot of people wished they would have done much more with mandarin as he is a pretty big bad in the comics and they hyped him up a lot  but i think this movie just makes people excited for the next marvel movie rather than truly giving this mcu story life  and with the movie being 2 hours long  it felt so rushed and at the same time most viewers were waiting for it to just end and i'll say it  she could be a nice gal but awkwafina     i just know i'm not the only one who finds her out of place on screen sometimes  and that's all i will say about that respectfully lol ,Positive
1038,no story  no plot  all you see is too much obvious and weird cgi and maybe i'm just tired of these movies giving me nothing but computer power so thanks for nothing but too much emptiness ,Negative
1039,somehow      this is now the worst marvel film to date  complete trash  people praising the cartoonish cgi lol  omg the bus scene!     was trash! watch it again  god i love slow motion fighting/falling in love scenes! god it's just the best!last thing i'll rant about is this      why would wong  who at the time of this film was the sorcerer supreme  be fighting in an underground black market fighting pit??? he wouldn't  like     no  he wouldn't  ever  oh wait are you saying he was there just so they could shoehorn in another mcu character because this movie is so bad it had to find a way to make people smile? yeah  trashbonus: ben kingsley was the best and only good thing about this film  his character has been redeemed ,Positive
1040,the martial arts in the movie were amazing and so fun to watch  the plot was decent and flowed nicely  i felt like it was a little long and also i didn't feel like it was connected to the mcu  i supposed it'll all come together at some point because as we know marvel never misses a beat  my biggest criticism was the acting  especially from awkwafina  her acting is awful  overacting throughout the entire movie  i didn't find her funny at all  although she was placed in the movie as comic relief  totally flopped  and of course  she has to be the character that has no fighting experience whatsoever but ends up helping save the day  ridiculous  overall a good movie but not in marvel's top 10 ,Positive
1041,i have loved the marvel movies and watch them over and over  i'm don't read comic books  just enjoy the movies for what they are  this had the essential elements for me: main characters that i like and can get invested in and humor to go along with all the action  i look forward to seeing them again ,Positive
1042,i entered the theatre to watch 'shang chi and the legend of the ten rings' with skepticism as i was pretty much disappointed with the phase 4 of marvel films  though  the story is predictable  it is the philosophy that makes the film worthwhile  the philosophy of maya which is unexplored in films from indian subcontinent despite having the origins from the same and hollywood doing justice to the dogma  oh boy  i am thrilled  kudos  marvel ,Positive
1043,this movie is much better than black widow  it's funny  it's exciting  and full of adventure!must see this summer!,Positive
1044,this movie is brilliant  it combines the mcu cinematic effects with the old fashioned martial arts films and bonus   it is very funny  the acting is great  the pace is great  the story is good  need i say more?,Positive
1045,"i know that i'm going to get blasted  but i was really disappointed with this movie  the fight scenes were ok  but katy  one of the main characters  tried too hard to be funny (and wasn't ) she was the most annoying mcu character i've ever seen i'm not asian  but i felt very uncomfortable with the not so subtle jabs at the asian american culture vs ancient chinese one  the main characters seemed to ""whitewashed"" to be taken as asian heros i did enjoy the amc dolby atmos technology though ",Negative
1046,"wasn't expecting much due to the recent black widow experience  but was fairly surprised by the quality of this film  the storyline is still the cliche origin story  but this one has good action sequences  good character building  good exploration into the core ideas of our culture  good representation of some of the mythical beens in it  actors speaking actual mandarin chinese not some weird ones with alien accents that hollywood used to think is chinese  phase 4 of mcu looks a bit more promising after this  a solid 6 for pass 1 more star for leung chiu wai  this is one of those where the ""villain"" is more likeable than the protagonist  without his performance this whole thing would have been so mundane ",Positive
1047,honestly i think a lot of these marvel superhero movies are vastly overrated and this is no exception  a friend of mine asked if i wanted to join him in the theater and i said 'very well i shang chi it with you!'  all jokes aside i wish i hadn't  it's just too lengthy for such a mediocre story and movie  they wallow way too much in the boring and uninteresting family drama of the family shang chi  we get it they have daddy issues no need to hammer it in every other scene  also we get it they are asian without cramming in every single asian stereotype like dragons in there  also i feel kind of bad for shang chi for training all his life and then his peeping tom sister just looks at them training from the shadows and just spins and twirls some chains around alone like she is training for the upcoming rhythmic gymnastics meet only to become much better at fighting than his brother and everyone else there despite them engaging in hard sparring and having personal guidanceetc    but that's just how it is  girls can do anything guys can and not only that they can do it better ,Positive
1048,i grew up on marvel in the 70's  80's and 90's  sold my comic book collection and bought a new car and full scuba gear when i was in my 20's  marvel in the 90's were addressing real life issues such as pcp  heroin and other related issues  then we had these b grade comics  most of the time i didn't even bother reading them because they were so predictable and crap  to waste the money of this magnitude on this disneyland garbage is an insult to stan lee ,Positive
1049,lots of stylized fighting scenes  if you have seen many kung fu movies  this is an average one  if you have not  it may be of interest  story line was predictable  throw in some dragons  flying bats etc for special effects  some stereotyping characters  so don't be offended ,Positive
1050,this movie was absolutely phenomenal! the acting  the fight choreography  the visuals  the villain  the lore  the story it was all superb! i went into this movie only seeing the first teaser so i didn't really know what to expect  what i got was a beautifully crafted epic journey that made me surprisingly emotional at some parts which was very welcomed for a marvel film  my main worry was awkwafina because i really can't stand her as an actress but man she was great in this  everyone was pretty great honestly  also watch this stoned if you can   there are some crazy awesome visuals in this film! easily the best solo mcu film since iron man 1 ,Positive
1051,this movie is kinda fun at first but gets old fast  wish they had stuck to the martial arts ninja aspect more  kinda felt like 'batman begins' but later it just felt like an animated movie and felt really cheesy  also i don't like what they did with shang chi's girlfriend  she's funny and i enjoy her in general but they really didn't justify making her super important  like there is no reason for her to be good at bow and arrow  should've left her as the funny love interest and let the sister steal the show as the badass girl (cause she was well written so her fighting skill makes sense) in conclusion  this is a decent watch but wears out it's welcome about half way through ,Positive
1052,"mandarin  in the marvel comics  is a very powerful villain with truly awesome powers  once again  marvel destroy that opportunity and replaces mandarin with ""some random dude with completely different powers""  it was still a good movie  but i really hate that they never get mandarin right  as a villain ",Positive
1053,the best aspects of this movie is hand to hand combats(without the rings) and simu liu is awesome in it and embraces the character  the story is good if consider standalone which it is but i have problems with other aspects of movie elements  the entire movie is shooted in closed studio environment with huge set pieces (marvel is doing such things for last many movies e g  the last 2 avengers movies)  it is very very very stupid to look at and the non sensical vfx  still remember the first iron man movie in which the original and vfx elements are hard to distinguish and have had a good balance in reality and fantasy world  the movie is forcing the humours too in some cases  in some case they tried to mimic crouching tiger hidden dragon  this movie certainly have some asian vibe in movie making style but i think there were manipulation in making by studio over creator  the music of the movie is good  overall it's a good movie  i am going to give any special attention for other upcoming marvel movies( maybe because i left behind my fantasy world)  i think there will not be any 'classic' from marvel in upcoming future ,Positive
1054,"what a great start for the phase 4  fresh  and has a strong character arc  went over my expectations  simu liu seems fit and perfect for the role  alongside with the legends (tony leung and michelle yeoh) making this movie much more enjoyable also  great scores! overall  this is as good as black panther  can't wait to see what happens next for shang chi and as chinese descendant  those ""asian parent trying to raise a perfect kid"" thing got me ps: i recommend you guys watch it in cinema ",Positive
1055,"the action  martial arts  and cinematography is top notch  i find myself nodding in awe and saying ""wow"" in many scenes  i'm left craving for more action  i love the idea of power being combined with skill  the martial arts element really adds creativity and a whole new world of moves and skills open up  it's not a bunch of powerful people throwing out nonstop blasts or a strong thing throwing brute punching left and right the world is beautiful  the musical guides you  the tone filled with art and symbolism  beautiful all around  and shoutout to ronny chieng! seeing him make an appearance was pretty funny with some of the weaker elements i will have to point to the pacing  there were a few moments that felt dragged out or unnecessary  some screen time was given to certain characters that didn't need it and they should focus a little more time on certain relationships overall i enjoyed the movie and lot and was left craving for more ",Positive
1056,a made for china marvel movie hollywood sold its soul to china  a long time back  laughably  the russians are still the bad guys for hollywood that said  the movie has great visuals  beautiful sfx  but is frankly dull and boring akwafina provides the customary few laughs  but ended up as the one character i cared for also the previous marvel/avenger movies were more in the realm of science fiction (with the exception of thor)    but with this movie marvel enters a full blown fantasy mode ,Negative
1057,it's quite rare to see a superhero film these days where there is actually a good story  good acting  and has the ability to keep you wanting to see more this film ticks all the boxes  only very slight let down is occasionally the cgi appears to be on the poor side (however luckily it's not throughout the entire film) another great good vs morally clouded flick if you haven't seen it  definitely worth the watch don't forget  there are two post credit scenes after the movie ,Positive
1058,i absolutely loved this film  it's packed with action and really good martial arts  the film is really funny  it's got a great story line  the acting is fab ,Positive
1059,good action  good fighting  good visuals  the obvious comedic relief of the movie was actually a good character  awkwafina was very enjoyable here  in all this new marvel movies i always wonder where are all the other super heroes and why are they not helping  but here it makes sence bc is a personal sotry  not an alien invasion or mega mobs  i rated with a 7  i think it's fare  nothing groundbreaking ,Positive
1060,everything is good in this movie  and nothing is really missing  however it also does not really bring much new  i enjoyed the chinese representation of the movie  it is fun to see a maccau instead of a las vegas all the time ,Positive
1061,i liked the characters  fight scenes  acting music  and costumes  the story was predictable and half of the cgi looked cheap though ,Positive
1062,this whole movie was garbage except ben kingsley's tiny part which was hilarious  insult of a marvel movie  way dragged out  horrible script  horrible plot  horrible acting ,Negative
1063,i have loved marvel movies since the beginning and the continuous entertainment through the years is phenomenal  marvel continues to deliver every time!i was hyped for shang chi since the first trailer  the trailers i would agree don't serve the film true justice  this is because of how little they show you the characters are thorough and loveable  the storytelling is delightful and don't even get me started on the action  the action goes against all the issues people say about modern day action films  i believe the fight scenes are up there with the raids  they are choreographed fantastically  they are fast paced and adrenaline pumping the theme of the film is sensational and it truly delivers  my only issues with the film is i think the second act can be a bit slow compared to the first and third act  even with that said there are twists and turns along the way to keep you surprised at minimum i believe it is a guarantee you will enjoy this film  shang chi is one of the best  if not the new best solo character marvel movie all i can say is if you love fight movies  action movies  marvel movies or fantasy films  this is for you  even if you aren't big on them this film will by minimum give you a good time  it's a blast  i'm planning to go see it again soon and i can't wait! i am beyond ecstatic for shang chi to be apart of the avengers!go see it!,Positive
1064,marvel has started its new era  which will be interesting for their old fans and will attract the attention of new audience  the film's director  deston creton  did a good job  perfectly selected cast of actors who have done their tasks for 100%  they understand their characters and clearly convey their emotions  gorgeous costumes and joel west's soundtracks  with chinese motives  aptly create an atmosphere of a magical world we haven't seen before  i won't say anything bad about the script either  i didn't mantion any plot holes  and the bonus was good jokes and a touching and sometimes tragic family story  bill pope's balanced shots and amazing special effects  which have definitely reached a new level  also go to the film's pluses  a special tribute to the director of the fights andy chang  clear movements and dynamic music make such scenes a real spectacle  this film is worth your attention my rating is 8 5 / 10 ,Positive
1065,this movie right here is amazing! i will watch this over & over  i have to read more into how this movie comes into play but overall good! it's something when you witness something you think it's good and nothing can top it  then comes this movie! like i stated avengers  what's that?,Positive
1066,as an asian american i was truly excited for this film and had very high hopes  i was very worried it would just be a woke response to not having an all asian cast yet  and unfortunately that happened to be the case  shang chi lacks character development  solid cgi techniques  an engaging plot  a great villain  and substance  the good thing is that it helped me fall asleep at night ,Positive
1067,this movie is so amazing  the only issue is the beggening and how we got introduced to everything was a little bet slow   otherwise  it's a greate production ,Positive
1068,well  here we are    the truth is out: most of the movies by marvel are way better than most of the movies by anyone else  there's a story  beautiful visuals  love and drama  some comedy   a package well worth big screen experience! go and see it if you are a fan of action and/or fantasy magical movies! it does it all ,Positive
1069,shang chi is one of the best marvel movies in 2021 which can mean it really fits for a superhero like him  it reminds me of mulan  and the avengers movie at the same time  i can't wait for the sequel soon  too!,Positive
1070,i just watched this on disney+ and i was incredibly excited to watch it! unfortunately much of that excitement was lost halfway through it started to become overly cheesy  and i don't know why! and the special effects  as much as some of it was beautiful  got to be quite cartoony instead of realistic the 2 credit scenes were brilliant  and awkwafina stole the movie for me (she was fantastic!)   but aside from that i would say not the best marvel offering i'm actually glad that i waited and didn't waste money to see this at the cinema  sorry!!,Positive
1071,marvel created another masterpiece  and this has various types of action and that was wow😲 this movie is must watch for marvel fans and non marvel fans because this movie is treat to watch 🔥🔥🔥,Positive
1072,the martial art scenes that aren't full of cgi are beautiful and a nice tribute to old cinema  but after that it breaks down  it's a predictable cgi fest  with mediocre characters i thought awakafina was great  everyone else was average  though it was meant to be a martial arts superhero film  it ended up just a marvel film i enjoyed it  but it was forgettable  and sorry to mention it again but the cgi got on my nerves  the dragons and stuff where ok cgi but got repetitive overall worth watching  but noting special  except the martial arts where beautiful ,Positive
1073,marvel played it safe with this one and made a standard film about a chinese american dude that knows kung fu  shang chi in this movie is nothing like in the original comics  very americanized and people pleasing take on the character  the movie has it's strong points like tony leung as the mandarin  he feels like the only genuinely real character in the movie whom i can relate to  you can feel his every emotion and he is overall the best thing about this movie as so many have said  i actually enjoyed the original shang chi comics because of their deep philosophies and introspective queries  plus the groundbreaking way they mixed action with interesting stories  this movie is lacking in that department  generic martial arts action we have seen before  boring story for the most part  too many forced jokes and try hard laugh inducing scenes  and westernization of chinese culture  all star michelle yeoh makes an appearance in the third act and does her famous tai chi and crouching tiger hidden dragon schtick  wong also appears and is fun as always  abomination was in the film for just as long as he was in the trailer  oh yeah  and ben kingsley reappears as trevor slattery  the fake mandarin actor from iron man 3 and his story since then is addressed  that little creature he had was annoying rather than the typical cute character they intend to put onto all of these movies  overall  i expected better  so now i may just wait until the new spider man comes out to go back to the theaters  this was a filler movie that felt rushed  go see it with the kids or something ,Positive
1074,this movie is to me a pleasant surprise  the father son storyline was touching  the special effects are excellent  the fight scenes are *chef's kiss * (especially the one in the bus  it reminded me of jackie chan) morris is cute  this film was made with love  great care and enthusiasm and it shows ,Positive
1075,the movie starts off strong  but loses traction around the middle and goes downhill by the end action and visuals are good plot follows the typical marvel formula ,Positive
1076,"have not been a huge fan of the disney/marvel universe films as of late  but  this one was a shock to me this film was very well done  it was great because they had a very ""jackie chan"" feel to the movie with the rhythm and pace of the fight scenes  which made sense because of the trainer and stunt coordinator  he was the one that worked closely with chan throughout his career the film was great because it steered clear of all of the ""pc"" b  s  and was just a great action superhero movie  it is all i want to see when i see a movie the action was incredible  the main actor and actress that played the sister were incredible to watch  the story was also not too predictable  so it made it enjoyable i highly recommend watching this one to have it help kind of tie some of the old iron man movies and some of the shows together ",Positive
1077,it's a nice classic marvel movie with great imagery  funny moments  and epic fighting  it was candy to the eyes and was wholesome to watch  i wasn't sure about the cast picked but after watching this and getting to know the characters portrayed they absolutely work  you know how the first iron man and thor movies made you feel? this movie is like that  not too many side plots  no going down the rabbit hole trying to keep up with this and that  this was a straight story line with great character building  while there is a ton of cgi i felt it wasn't overly done; it was used when needed and was not overbearing  i have to give props the awkwafina  as well  she did a great job keeping up with the heavily driven scenes  she was still her funny self but she knew when to pull back on her signature funny schitck and played out the serious/low key scenes to perfection  this was a good role for her and i hope to see her in the next shang chi movie ,Positive
1078,it's the same old at this point with these movies  unoriginal plot  story is bland  predictable and the jokes are just recycled now  no idea how you could give this more than a 6 out of 10 really wasn't impressed at all ,Positive
1079,i have already watch this movie three times this movie was awesome  it had everything from action to comedy and the really embraced the chinese culture in this movie  but i was more excited for the post credit scene and i think we have not seen the last of shang chi ,Positive
1080,i really like this movie because this movie had comedy action and they really embraced the chinese culture and i can't wait to see more of shang chi ,Positive
1081,don't listen to the negative reviews  this movie captures your attention from the very beginning  it is visually and emotionally engaging  if you are a fan of the marvel universe you will love this instalment ,Positive
1082,"it's an entertaining yet slightly boring film about family    i went in thinking it would be about learning about the dark magic of the mcu and the keepers of the magic  instead of giving any answers to the magic side of the mcu  new plots and characters are introduced generic tropes in full force: bad guy knife hand served no purpose other than to further the plot  if he had a name  it didn't matter  he's in the movie a lot and supposedly commands something but it's never explained or the audience isn't supposed to care  which baffles me about the amount of screen time that character was given  a few characters were washed and repeated  the guy on the bus live streaming and narrating has been in a lot of marvel movies  he was peter parker's friend in spider man  except that movie was actually funny all the funny parts were forced and fell flat for me  i didn't chuckle once  quirky dialogue can be hit or miss and i felt like this movie was outdated when it came to dialogue; when the producers probably spent the most time re writing that side of the script  it didn't work but i just say shang was phenominal  i would love to see him come back  awkwafina     felt miscast  i think she did what she could with the role  but i also felt it was meant for a bubbly character and she played it like a guy's girl aka ""one of the guys""  it took me a while to realize awkwafina was not the sister a lot of unanswered questions like why were the jade pendants so important if they didn't do anything once stolen/recovered? why didn't the siblings want their lifelong heirlooms from a dead parent back once united with their father? also the action sets were super confusing  scaffolding on a building over 50 floors high  or more? a secret map that both pursing parties find quite easily? that throwaway thespian and his winged squishy contributed what to the story?this did not feel like a marvel movie  and that's fine  but it hardly had any emotional investment for all those long standing slow motion shots a forgettable origin story with bland characters and no discernible antagonist ",Positive
1083,action sequences are badass  tony leung and simu liu are terrific  and the film has a lot more emotional weight than i expected  humor falls a little flat but this is an above average mcu film ,Positive
1084,when i went to see this movie in the theater i was surprised by how good it it had good action and some parts actually made me laugh and surprisingly good acting i would definitely watch this movie again ,Positive
1085,"the vibe of this movie is really really ""asian"" and that's great  the story is not like what i expected but i love it  the concept is a little bit similliar like black panther  the friendship between shang chi and katy is wholesome  unexpected and contain a good messages especially for chinese the main thing that i really freakin love about this is the visual and music which is extremly amazing great! gorgeous! magnificent!",Positive
1086,in fours words  expectations were too high pros: tony leung chiu wai's wonderful acting  the beautiful graphics  some jokes  introduction of new characters in the mcu cons: tony leung not speaking cantonese is a missed opportunity  story was kinda boring  and quite a number of unnecessary scenes somehow i feel this movie is not on the same level as other mcu movies  it's supposed to be shang chi's movie  but wen wu stole the limelight ,Positive
1087,imagine a world where you're not the main character in your own franchise; where you were trained as a deadly assassin  but you're completely dismantled by your little sister kicking you in the nethers; where you must constantly learn to be a better hero from stronger women; and when it's time for your big hero moment  the woman that has friendzoned you steals your thunder introducing marvel's shang chi ,Positive
1088,great visuals  nice story  excellent fight scenes  fun moments  and mysteries for the future  just everything needed in a marvel movie  marvel did it once with black panther  and now does it again with shang chi  mixing superhero movie into a cultural environment  just great!,Positive
1089,"i follow a lot of of movie sites/groups on facebook and man we're there q ron if stories and glorifying about this movie    i just don't get it   it was just ""ok"" nothing great nothing terrible    i can appreciate i'm the asian hero and the character but i just think it's crouching tiger hidden dragon shoved into the mcu  story just felt weird  i like others really disliked watching a 10 min ban commercial and don't like what they did with they did with ben kingsley character    but it was enjoyable enough i just thought i to was average at best ",Positive
1090,waited to watch this for no extra cost on disney+  kind of a chore to sit through  way too much cgi to engage you (might as well watch raya if i'm in the mood for that)  akawafina and kingley let me awake ,Positive
1091,a dazzling visual and special effects phenomenon that brought acting  fight scenes and story telling together to bring us one of the top marvel movies to the deserved big screen  i wanted this to be great and it exceeded my expectations  well done by all involved  kevin feige's super power must be to bring people together and letting do their their story without controlling every aspect of the production ,Positive
1092,"there's a lot to love about shang chi  there's also a lot to grimace about  both feelings lurk beneath the surface and draw awareness to themselves at various times  creating a wishy washy overall impact where i'm critical? there's a bit of a haphazard pace to this film  many scenes contain plot points and/or action sequences that are unbalanced in terms of what is glossed over and what is overly drawn out  there were serious opportunities to do some world building with the new ingredients provided by the vigorously refreshing asian cultural influence  but it felt like director destin daniel cretton was often going through the motions  checking boxes like he was playing marvel bingo  the climax  while visually appealing  was predictable from moment to moment and really did not have me on the edge of my seat  tony chiu wai leung's villain also didn't quite stick the landing with me  though i've read that his character has really resonated with asian audience members so i'll humbly accept that maybe his motives lay just a bit outside of my perspective  there were also several ""oh  okay  sure"" moments  lets call them  but a least the writers had the modesty to poke fun at themselves (see: katy's awe at her own random overnight mastery of a certain skill later in the film) what i really enjoyed? the cast and characters  first of all  marvel almost always gets this right  awkwafina's charisma is palpable  her character  katy  never gets in the way of shang chi's natural progression and is genuinely interesting in her own right  i also appreciate the writers' restraint in not simply using her as something to be exploited by the villains to distract/misdirect shang chi  meng'er zhang is also a revelation as xialing  shang chi's scorned  steely sister  although  a bit more clarity on what her characters' ultimate goals are would have gone a long way as her post credits appearance left me a bit confused as to where she stands in the greater story  in regards to simu liu  i personally felt like he got a bit hoodwinked by the writers who really didn't give shang chi a strong personality other than kicking butt  regardless  i totally praise his performance and find him endearing to no end  i have faith that he'll really shine when he's plopped into the dynamic of the avengers  as an aside  just wanted to give an obligatory shoutout to the visual effects and concept designs of the mythical creatures and surreal locations in the film  they really nailed it to that end  a completely worthy addition to the mcu that sometimes feels like it's only purpose was to introduce us to the new toy in the marvel universe that is ""the ten rings"" themselves ",Positive
1093,i don't get the mcu anymore  they've made more terrible films than they have good movies  this was better than the eternals but that's really not saying that much  both movies are awful and should not be added to the mcu awkwafinas performance was probably the only fun thing in the movie and her presence made no sense to the story  watch spiderman instead  that's a movie they actually cared enough about to make something decent  this was just thrown together to try to appeal to as many audiences as possible  same with black panther  the only difference be8mg that you could take out 20 30 mins of black panther and it would be totally amazing whereas this movie is just garbage ,Positive
1094,below average martial art flick and falls short as a super hero film  most of the movie isn't in english  first act was promising  2nd act boring  last act saved the movie from an absolute fail  character development was weak  no build up for the fight scenes  not enough conflict  dull storyline/protagonist/plot can't really say much good about this film  seemed to miss every mark  had a few promising moments  not enough build up to any meaningful conflict  hard to stay invested when half the movie isn't in english  the fight scenes weren't great  didn't quite feel like a marvel film and yet didn't quite deliver as a martial arts film  everything that makes a superhero film or martial art film good was just missing here  lots of ways this could have went better  seemed rushed  bad writing and under budget perhaps ,Positive
1095,post scene was amazing  i really excited to watch shang chi with avenger's  the new universe  but miss the my man  man of iron man and captain america ,Positive
1096,i came in the movie theatre just expecting a run of the mill cog in the mcu    and i came out seeing the best solo original movie since guardians of the galaxy back in 2014 it has a charming  kind of relatable antagonist  a relatively likable sidekick  a three dimensional antagonist  a far reaching redemption arc with ben kingsley  good action pieces  well placed emotional moments  the only thing it might lack would be some additional real world set pieces  but apart from that  i cannot find much fault with it hopefully  it gets a sequel and the character gets a stronger presence in the larger mcu  he frankly deserves it thanks to this movie ,Positive
1097,"plus:
tony leung perfomance
action sequences
climax portion
chinese representation
emotional weightminus:
dull and routine start of first half
less intriguing scenes
hero portion not much elevated
no proper backstory for 10 ringsverdict:a decent watch for audience and visual treat for fans     ",Positive
1098,this is a really good movie  the only bad parts are the parts that tie it into the mcu  i like the mcu  but it kinda feels really forced with this movie ,Negative
1099,first  this is over praised  yes  the actings are good  cgi? this is disney man!! never made me disappointed  action scenes? obviously good so the story?? this is where we have to discuss  some might think this is good enough for story telling  not for me  i feel kinda lacking at building villain character through the whole movie  and i still can't believe how they introduced ten rings origin so bad  come on marvel  i know you can do better  conclusion  is this one of the best in mcu? not even close  for me  cap america: winter soldier is the best in mcu solo movies ,Positive
1100,the best possible start also the worst possible ending the ugliness of the end cannot be described a kid can write a better ending than this ridiculous ending ,Negative
1101,boring  nothing special predictable nonsense  all flash  no substance  fight scenes are laughable  aquavelva needs to retire horrible actress  marvel should have stopped with endgame ,Negative
1102,keeping it short  this movie had it all  great story  writing  direction  acting  villain  comedy and fight direction i'm a huge old school kung fu movie fan and i was a bit sceptical about how they will show the fight scenes  glad they kept it authentic with the fight director (who worked with jackie chan a lot)  it was insane the story itself was superb  the villain's character development was amazing  the direction was not rushed and at the same time it didn't bore me for a single second best non avengers mcu movie for me  i can watch this again today after watching it last night ,Positive
1103,congratulation for this movie got created for 4+ year old children  i never thought that marvel will lower to this level  this movie is equal with aquaman which was a terrible movie the best scene was the credit scene  i believe :(,Negative
1104,"the introduction of new superheroes into the cinematic universe has always been accompanied by reactions from the audience  people who are not familiar with comics take a long time to adapt to new characters on the screen  there was a time when not everyone knew even thor  the guardians of the galaxy have been cleverly introduced with humor to further develop their inherent style of comedy and adventure  but what about asian rental? after all  the profit of the middle kingdom brings a lot  so the director destin daniel cretton raised the comics from the dusty shelf before us seems to be a typical marvel movie  but after the large scale ""the avengers"" it is perceived dryly and narrowly  easter eggs  of course  are shooting from everywhere  yes  a few cameos will pleasantly delight fans  but if the tape had been separately about shang chi and the legend  and not with a postscript to the mcu  it would have turned out much better  to seed the plot  the opening story of the ten rings serves as an explanation of the artifact and a representation of the antagonist the amusement ride introduces us to shang chi and his girlfriend katie  while the introduction of the characters is accompanied by routine episodes  leading to a showdown in the kung fu style in order to somehow entice  there is no excitement inherent in kvm films  the story of the return to his homeland  the fight against the ghosts of the past and the clouding of the mind of the main villain give the journey and disclosure of the hero  constant flashbacks somehow clarify the situation  hence the uncomfortable perception it was unexpected to meet emil blonsky   aka abomination  thirteen years have passed since the incredible hulk  and now we meet again  such vivid and colorful underground battles between the heroes complement this story with a general view of the universe after thanos' snap  to add shang chi to the magic branch of the cme  wong meets us with his portal rings  the fight against the past and the disclosure of an ancient legend is accompanied by drama  regular flashbacks and a funny play on mandarin and the events of the third ""iron man""  actually  trevor slattery visited the plot of this mcu series the picture tries to ascribe all the events already known  either playfully playing on previous films  then approaching the new artifact with all seriousness  the key location  which both reveals the prophecy and explains the legend of ancient evil  sends us to narnia  seriously  a magical land with fantastic creatures (newt scamander has already left) refers to all family  adventure films about the struggle between good and evil  in addition to the chronicle of narnia  we have here ""bridge to terabithia""  ""spiderwick: the chronicles""  ""inkheart""  ""jumanji""  but not like the marvel cinematic universe  an epic fight at the end   as it should be  demonstrating the power of the rings and setting yourself on the path of a warrior entertainment  which is set to show action  a magical world  battles and acceptance of your past  no sense of connection with previous films  despite the references and cameos  the film should be taken as an individual project  the post credits scene already reveals familiar faces and attributes ten rings to common magical artifacts in kamar taj actor simu liu looked simple and new  if  for example  the first performance of doctor strange was accompanied by the already familiar benedict cumberbatch  then shang chi does not boast of this  the target audience has already thinned noticeably  in addition  the eternal problem of the mcu is raised   no one knew about the threat  except for the heroes of the new picture  okay nick fury (or skrulls)  but the ancient one  doctor strange? such a massive threat  which actually had to somehow react to thanos' click  in general  we are again stepping on the same rake  ignoring our own rules ",Positive
1105,first marvel film with an asian lead are you ready hell yeah  first seeing the trailer thought it will be a good film but turns out i love it to the core  this film has all the elements humor  fighting  acting all done right  the main thing that attracts me is that the movie didn't waste a single minute in any other things  fully focused on the plot and nothing else  things got me wow is fight between wong and abomination and after the fight discussion between them and also the fighting choreography and cinematography were too good that i can't take my eyes of for a second  and most of all it's not the kind of the other family stories it different in many way  so that's it enjoy the movie see it in theaters if you have a chance  stay safe    and don't miss the post credits there is real surprise waiting ,Positive
1106,i'll keep it short & sweet  this way exceeded my expectations  i was kinda burnt out on marvel & didn't love the stuff they were putting out in phase 4 but this was awesome and the hype is back baby! post credit scenes are hinting at some big stuff make sure to stick around!,Positive
1107,the action  i can actually see what's going on for some reason i was fighting my tears for the last 20 minutes of the movie  this story is well done and the actor that plays shaun  amazing talent ,Positive
1108,this was a lot better than i expected  the fight scenes are amazing  and it was so emotional i gave it a 10 because of how much i enjoyed it  but there are some stuff that i think it could be better simu liu is nice  he does a good job in the fight scenes  but i think he lacks facial expressions and charisma about his sister  they could have done more with her  i wanted to see more interactions between her and her parents  instead of just hearing her telling the stories to katy  so if you take that away from her  she's just there to be the strong and independent woman  which is fine  but i wish they had done more with her and last  death dealer  he had an interesting design and the mask  so i expected something interesting about him  but there was nothing lol other than that  the movie is amazing  tony leung was great  his death scene broke my heart ,Positive
1109,the movie was funny  full of action and very wel made  will definitely watch it in the cinema again ,Positive
1110,this film brought good feeling about family and the impression of mcu  i like vfx in the films  looks amazing but one thing that bother me is the film shows how much shang chi's dad loves him but why his dad hit him to the bottom of the lake and left him died there? his dad did not trying to pull him up or sort of at all  is this how his dad loves him?,Positive
1111,marvel has done it again  and again  and again  this movie is for anyone! marvel super fans and just good ol' movies fans  it's is one of the coolest origin stories i've ever seen (marvel or non marvel)  the fight scenes were some of the best choreographed work you'll see  right up there with civil war and black panther  so awesome to get super powers along side of martial arts  the cgi was so amazing especially at the end  the comedy was perfectly placed  the music/film score was so well put together  it made the movie  amazing movie  excited for more! stay for the mid and end credits  so glad this is proving that movies are back ,Positive
1112,shang chi is full of amazing action (like awesome choreographed fights)  funny actors  and a creative plot to achieve spectacular results  a surprising hit i did not expect to be this amazing ,Positive
1113,great story!! great acting!! great fight choreography!! marvel movie done right!! baffled that i waited so long to see this  i honestly had low expectations going in and i was extremely surprised because this movie greatly surpassed them  looking forward to what's next in the shang chi chapter ,Positive
1114,"when i started watching it  i felt very sleepy then again i continued it the next day      saw little   felt sleepy third time  i decided to finish it  sat and finshed it  thank god not even one character  showed any spark  any charm all boring  was it the director's fault story was bad   so many copied scenes of other movies after watching this boring movie  i saw another boring movie
""tomb raider 2018""  lame story     bad performance  looks like they dont want to pay the good actors and story writers  dumb ",Negative
1115,"what a movie   fantastic  a superhero movie that's been excellent visual treat too    so very beautifully crafted   
story telling   graphics   charectorization name the department it excels   
this is a must watch   i love the mcu universe   but this stands apart for its amazing story telling and visuals    ",Positive
1116,this movie is a must see of 2021  it's has a great story and i am willing to see it again  words can't describe how good it was ,Positive
1117,really great performances and a good plot that has some truly beautiful and wonderful moments  the inclusion of chinese culture  creatures and architecture was inspired  one of the best mcu villains ever the characters leave a little to be desired as they aren't always well written  the cgi isn't great and sometimes is perfectly fine and other times looks really bad best marvel movie of 2021 so far ,Positive
1118,shang chi is a visual treat   it has great acting  great visual effects but it lacks on screenplay in the 2nd half   the 1st half was so good  i was enjoying the movie very very much with great martial arts and comic timing from awkwafina   the bus fight scene was just amazing!!! so good!! after the 1st half is done   the movie went downhill   it could have been better but still it was decent   anyways shang chi and the legend of ten rings serves the purpose of entertainment and we can say that marvel studios never disappoint us with their movies  7 7/10 ⭐,Positive
1119,"what i like :1)the action  especially in the first half and the building scene that make me nervous and scared on the characters2) great visuals and good cinematography  colors  cgi was really amazing3)i love the acting4) a good villan that really do everything for a purpose not because he is the bad guy so he acts like that (like the villan of ""black widow"" movie)now  what i don't like1)like every marvel movie the movie begins strong and introduce the characters then it becomes more slow with good comedy and some action and we go to a journey to the final battle full of cgi fights  ok guys there are some people who love cgi fights but not me  the fight was a bit terrible and predictable (honestly i love the action in this movie but not the final battle)2) the movie is full of emotional scenes but (do i feel anything? no)3) the music was good but not epic and there is no great theme for shang chi (i loved the music and the songs but it wasn't good enough)overall good action movie with a great action sequences and good comedy and good villan and cinematography and cgi  but it's a *marvel* movie  with cgi final battle and weak ending and a good setup for what comes nextthank you for reading my quick review  this is my opinion  the more important is your opinion and remember not everyone one love the same thing ",Positive
1120,loved it up there with the best marvel films funny with great action scenes and 'kate' is the best ,Positive
1121,settled in to watch this with no expectations the martial arts is awesome! the scenery is spectacular not a dull moment in it i suggest watching this with the family my kids loved it my son is 8 and he wants to be a ninja now ,Positive
1122,shang chi did just about everything right  it really was the mulan that the live action mulan tried to be and should have been it had comedy  suspense  amazing martial arts  female heroines and of course a dragon i went into this not expecting to like it but i was pleasantly surprised if they only gotten henry golding a role  the movie would have been a 10 ,Positive
1123,great cast but i was disappointed in the overall movie  it looked and felt like a made for tv child's fantasy movie  the special effects could be much more realistic ,Positive
1124,an amazing movie (original  great cast  nice soundtrack  cgi is just pure eye candy  good comical releaf as usual) and great addition to the marvel cinematic universe!!! can't wait for what's to come!,Positive
1125,"a great mix of action  levity  and family drama (who can't relate to that?) not seen since captain marvel (a cat hacking a tesseract hairball     again who can't relate) it is a visual masterpiece with elements any fan of the legend of zelda : breath of the wild will swoon over (maybe not something everyone can relate to) if the 10 rings ""ring"" a bell     check out iron man 3 for a refresher also make sure to hang around for mid  and end credit scenes ",Positive
1126,"stunts and fight scenes are best  
but story could be better ",Positive
1127,not sure what the hype was  story  script  acting were all third class  story also a disrespect to the chinese culture and society  the fightings were good so that's the 3 stars  left at 50th minutes  super disappointed with marvel ,Positive
1128,"this movie is medicore at best  nothing special
visually beautiful could have been better had great potential  but because of the marvel sandbox it messes up  and the typical marvel jokes for giving u a marvel feel spoils mosy of the intense and important scene ",Positive
1129,"superb next level action movie  background sound tracks are amazing and fights also ultimate  you can see the movie in theatre's its really good experience  marvel studios making always a guarantee project for audions  the movie lovers must watch the ""shang chi""movie ",Positive
1130,shang chi was honestly amazing  the cinematic experience was great and the story and plot of the movie was very good too  i am a huge marvel fan and it makes me happy to see that they are branching out to different types of hero's from all types of backgrounds  to sum up my review i really enjoyed it and highly recommend  (stay for the credits to the end),Positive
1131,i thought the movie was really great  the fight scene  the story  and the character  i would definitely recommend this for people to watch ,Positive
1132,this was amazing i loved everything about it and oh my gosh i have no complaints ahhskdjhsjkjdf10/10 wanted to re watch directly after i finished it ,Positive
1133,this is how you take super ability and make it realistic  nothing was overdone  not even the cgi  they took their time with the story development  yet there was enough tension between the characters to drive the fight scenes    what an amazing intro to some shang chi characters; simu liu is fantastic and the core of the film really sticks with the audience  this was legit ,Positive
1134,the cast  the costumes  the setting! to me  in my opinion (despite the few plot holes here and there) was already detailed enough  the action sequence was good  and the cgi  wow! you should see it for yourself when you get to watch that part  i rather be careful reviewing this because i don't really want to give away any spoilers  so forgive me if i wouldn't put much detail  i can only say that i went to the cinema not expecting so much  but in the end  i actually enjoyed it! so i recommend to give this movie a chance and watch it!,Positive
1135,it's a decent fun adventure movie  and it is very much your run of the mills marvel superhero movie these days  you got action  fight scenes  cg  and a decent share of jokes here and there  but beyond that  shang chi is another wasted opportunity  because the plot is so shallow it really makes no sense  i never quite get why shang chi hated his dad so much  nor exactly what his dad's feeling is towards his kids  the plot takes you whatever way is convenient to get to the next big scene  and there is no character development or even any consistency  nevertheless if you are fine with an action adventure roller coaster and don't care about acting or story telling  this one fits the bi  solid 7 from me ,Positive
1136,the music  the screenplay  the writing  the direction everything was on point  i went to a theatre to watch it and was literally stunned  i crave that background music  it's simply too good  ultimately  go for it  best 2 hours you'll have  wont regret it ,Positive
1137,i really wasn't paying much attention to this movie  but when i went to see it  dam was it enjoyable  story was engaging  the humour of this movie was fun  like being able to see won singing in the credit scene  fighting scenes where 10/10  and that's all i got to say about this movie ,Positive
1138,huge step up from black widow  this movie made it onto my top 3 favorite mcu movies list the new unique mcu origin story of shang chi wasn't that original but it was still very fun to go through  sometimes you forget you're watching a marvel movie  everything from the visuals  music and fight choreography was amazing and on point  there was also a good amount of humor inside but also a good amount of touching moments if you can see it  you should definitely go see it ,Positive
1139,most beautiful marvel movie there's ever been  the set design  world building  and character choices   all top notch  possibly the best fight choreography i've ever seen in a movie  outside of traditional kung fu films  i could see myself putting on this movie over and over again without getting bored of it  absolutely beautiful work of art  plot points definitely were meant to set up action scenes  but that's what a fighting film is supposed to do  some acting choices were a little off  but i'm willing to sacrifice that in order to have experienced fighters play the roles  tony leung crushed it  absolute standout  simu liu was a treasure  awkwafina made in a blast  michelle yeoh and fala chen added an amazingly beautiful artistry and depth to the movie ,Positive
1140,it was ok not much of a plot a lot of action  the whole movie seemed like it was adding up to another movie ,Positive
1141,i absolutely adore this film! the cinematography the acting the music the story  my god is the story good! having wenwu be a sympathetic character that you kinda root for in the film is great! wenwu is just the best marvel villain hands down no changing my mind  well there was some flaws  especially when it got halfway into the film  it got a little fast pace  and i am not a big fan of fast paced films  but it got better by the point where shang chi was thinking about how his mother died  and where it showed the flashbacks  the final battle was great until wenwu died  after that i didn't even know what was happening  overall it was a pretty solid film one of marvels best ,Positive
1142,how do i start  this movie first is full of excitement  i just seen it and i was blown away  the visuals was stunning and the fight scenes?? well i will say it was more than i expected in a very good way  i mean they were throwing down in this movie  it feel like a marvel movie not saying marvel is a bad franchise movie wise but   it has its own feel to it i do feel there is more to this movie  i will say i dont think the ten rings are the ten rings but something else  there are a lot of easter eggs in this movie from the hulk to iron man but they don't spend a lot of time going back in the past about heros  just small nods to some of the heros and certain movies  all in all this movie has strenth unlike black widow which had me falling asleep from time to time  a must go see  get the family and go see it in dolby digital at the theaters or imax  the beginning moves slow but it picks up and you're drawn in  i'm going back sunday to see it again  and i might go back the following sunday to see it as well  the movie is just that good   enjoy the watch of this movie  if you do not go   wel thats your lost ,Positive
1143,as the title says  i would recommend this movie to anyone who is already interested in it  as well as to anybody who is looking for a light kung fu inspired action comedy  i was largely disinterested in the dramatic scenes as i found the a little sitcomy feeling  which is fitting as both simu liu and awkwafina have backgrounds in tv comedy series'   but it unfortunately left most of the drama feeling flat in my experience  i did find the action scenes and general sense of style (especially in the first act) to be quite commendable  despite my general disinterest with the dramatic scenes i found the emotional climax to be quite compelling and well handled  so for these reasons i would recommend the movie to anyone who based on the promotional material is interested in seeing it  but i find myself weary to recommend anyone who found the promotional material to be disengaging as i did  as overall the movie was in my experience  just okay ,Positive
1144,i enjoyed it  i honestly found it funny and the action was a1  though i will say the plot was not it  there were no surprising factors so i practically predicted some of the scenes right ,Positive
1145,i love how this movie is just realistic and unrealistic at the same time  the graphics are visually appealing  and look insane  this movie was also kind of funny as well  and i would definitely rewatch this movie as much as i can  definitely worth watching ,Positive
1146,to be clear this is a very good and enjoyable movie  with amazing fighting and combat sequences  however by the end the quality of the combat is watered down by the end fight which is a generic cgi fight against a monster ,Positive
1147,fighting will only bring harm and hatred  if you hurt others  the relatives and friends of this person will seek revenge from you again  when is the time to avenge the grievances  i hope this world can fight less  and learn to let go of the hatred in the heart and give others appropriate tolerance ,Positive
1148,"simu liu brought it
really entertaining movie  actors were great simu liu brought it big time he is excellent as the main character  awkwafina is hilarious and i wish she had more screen time  as far as marvel movies goes  it's not the best one but still very good ",Positive
1149,the whole thing is like a bmw commercial  shot in narnia with a few urban dancing (pardon me  ''kungfu'') elements  the rest of the time it's just boring you to death  with an incredibly annoying cast (e g  the goofy sidekick cliché) with typical lame one liners that aren't even close to funny  a predictable plot  full of reprehensible contemporary vlogger content  however good the choreography might be  if it's the only thing that stands out  it's simply a bad movie also  this overhyped soundtrack is absolutely nothing special  terrible even  just some famous poppy tunes varied with some derivative oriental sounds too bad marvel seems to be truly unable to create anything for somewhat more intelligent adults oh  and for the wokers among us    ''i only bet on asian''  nothing racist about that at all  chicks can bust a guy's balls without expecting anything in return  nothing sexist about that at all  i could go on  but you get the idea ,Negative
1150,"only fun part is before shang chi goes to imaginary land  bus fight and building fight was cool
the rest movie is garbage  for sure disney new targets is asians  specially chinese to earn more money otherwise for international audiences is not interesting   ",Positive
1151,the plot twist with ben kingsley and what looks like a mop head is so so bad  film takes a nose dive after that  why? who thought that would be good ,Positive
1152,literally the most of enjoyed the film all year! it went from the best kung fu film on seen in decades to a great action film !!!! then to a amazing lord of the rings/kaiju/kung fu extravaganza!!!!!!,Positive
1153,this is by far the best marvel movie there is! and yes  i've seen them all  and no  i'm not asian ,Positive
1154,this movie was horrible  save your time & money  marvel must have been desperate  i don't even know what they were thinking  then you bring the guy that played mandarin lol so sad ,Negative
1155,"tony leung and fala chen was the standouts in this movie (in my own humble opinion)  something about their performances struck a chord with me and those two really got me into this moviethe movie is a fun action/fantasy ride  some cool shots and set pieces but it also suffers from those boring pg 13 fights most of the time  it got kind of gritty at some parts which was very welcome simu liu and awkwafinas relationship felt a little ""manufactured"" at first like there was no chemistry there but it got better as the movie went along  maybe their first scenes together were among the first being shot?the cgi was not the best  at some places it was painfully obvious where they've added cg when you kind of didn't need it and a practical effect or prop could have been used and that is something the mcu doesn't do too well overall another thing i really  really liked was the fact that there was more chinese spoken than i anticipated  that always ruins movies/shows/games when everyone speaks english to one another (even if they are in this case chinese or whatever the setting may be) but  despite the fact that there was more chinese spoken than i anticipated there was also a whole lot of english spoken solely between characters that aren't native english speakers  for example between shang chi and wenwu during their final fight  it's just those two no americans or other around ",Positive
1156,the storyline was alright  the acting was alright  would've given it 6/10 but leung's acting was what added one more point for me  the character was probably too simple for leung (i've watched his movie growing up)  but he really added a lot of depth to the role  unexpected chemistry between katy and shang chi? or are they just friends? i can't tell ,Positive
1157,the movie was very good  especially the soundtrack!! it was unique unlike other marvel movies which has a generic soundtrack  highly recommend yall watch this in theaters ,Positive
1158,an enjoyable film  showing shang chi's family history from his fathers side i found it laughable when his sister  excluded from kung fu training with the men of the ten rings  said she watched from afar and trained herself and became better than the men of the ten rings more of that yay girl power non sense ,Positive
1159,simu liu was really miscast  i kept thinking of him as the quirky son from kim's convenience! they really needed a younger donnie yen or chow yun fat to be the lead actor on this  plus ben kingsley and awkafina   really? very disappointing   had so much potential ,Negative
1160,great combination of high energy action  emotional context  and funny  it was a great introduction to these characters  looking forward to seeing them more!,Positive
1161,"good movie  it has a few things off kilter  the father's patina is lilting  odd  the movie drags a bit in spots  then there are the superb action scenes and plugged in version of an alternate universe accessible through a waterfall  don't ask  i am beginning to tire of chinese action sequences because they seem so much of the same but this movie has fresh stuff  the best part for me after the action scenes was wong  drunk on his ass  singing karaoke to hotel california  hysterical  the ""friend""/girlfriend in the movie is really superb so fresh and refreshing as ""the babe""  she was good  to be honest  the movie reminded me of a broadway play that needed another week or two of shakedown yet it still clicked in enough places that you know you've got something  the family scenes early on in the movie are nice and humanizing  it's got a few rough spots; the rest is good to very good  i see this story line  the characters  and where they go in the next movie only improving ",Positive
1162,"this movie surprised me big time  the plot was pretty much what i expected it to be  but the way they executed it was pretty amazing jackie chan hasn't been on the big screen for a while now  sobit was crazy exciting to see ""chan like"" fighting sequences again ",Positive
1163,"after a long time  everyone  especially the marvel studios' fans has a chance to watch their latest movie in theatres  and to be honest they will be pleased and they should watch this in theatres  you will get everything you need from a marvel flick shang chi and the legend of ten rings gives a new look at a new hero  it's fresh and it's entertainment at best  to start with positive aspects  the performance as usual are good  marvel never misses their castings  everyone gave their best  especially the leads liu and lueng  both portrayed themselves perfectly  i was expecting awkwafina to be a cringe  but she didn't disappointed  action just brilliant  flawless  the screenplay is elegant  seeing what new marvel is showing and what more is about to come will crave fans and everyone for more  especially the concept of ten rings  the mysticism and spiritual material is displayed brilliantly  fantasy at it's peak  the cgi is just   flawless as usual  works tooo damn neat the bad aspects of the movie i consider is the wenvu's (leung) unsatisfactory agenda  he's clearly a brilliant intimidating villian but with his agenda  he seems nothing but a delusional guy  the wong and abomination arc shown in the trailers fails to deliver any justice  the guy  so they say ""death dealer"" was supposed to be a prominent badass  but they wasted his potential  and marvel can't keep re using the formula of ""big third act""  ""good vs  evil""  with loads of cgi  they have to use and start giving new screenplays for climax  (also the last thing with katy being sudden hawkeye in the climax is just   facepalm  no way they did that!)nevertheless  the movie works fine  along with superb cinematography  good direction and decent background score  go watch this movie  you'll enjoy and have a good time  must watch  not a definite marvel masterpiece  but works and balances well with humor and outstanding action shang chi and the legend of ten rings: 4/5 stars ",Positive
1164,"just got back from the cinema  loved loved loved this film  it has got me so excited for the next phase of the mcu safe to say the ""mandarin"" has fast become one of my favourite mcu characters  all hail the king!!",Positive
1165,this movie was stunning  from the visual effects to the heart of the story to the phenomenal cast  i laughed  i cried and sat on the edge of my seat  well worth taking the risk during the pandemic to go see this one in the theater  the music was great as well  will definitely buy it when it comes out for rewatch  one of the best marvel movies imo ,Positive
1166,i've seen this twice and going for a third time this weekend  the fight scenes are *chefs kiss*  you're living under a rock if you haven't seen this film yet!,Neutral
1167,the first third of the movie is pretty good a light hearted action flick with likable characters and good action scenes the moment the actual plot gets going and they dive into the chinese fantasy cgi  though  the cringy cliche density becomes near unbearable  this is over the top in a way i´d usually only expect from a cheap early 90s hong kong b movie unfortunately this movie took itself seriously while applying said style terrible movie that left a bad taste     ,Positive
1168,from the first 20 minutes you can tell this was going to be a great movie and well produced the fight scene in the bus  graphics and animation were unreal  and for the actor  felt like i was watching a new age jackie chan the movie had a lot of comedy  action and story line was a little played out but still amazing best part is going to a movie that you hardly heard about and you're not really expecting much from the movie and it ends up being great   not really a spoiler but stay past the credits haha ,Positive
1169,as others have mentioned the fight choreography is probably the best to date in the mcu  long panning shots like the raid  john wick  daredevil (netflix series)  where it's almost like the punches actually land  and the use of the environment is almost comical in how ridiculous these fights become  the score reminded me of black panther where they incorporate some pretty awesome hip hop tracks  whereas in black panther some of the score felt forced and out of place  this films bass drops and transition to versus added a pretty slick feel to the film  unlike other most mcu entries post avengers  this film didn't seem to focus on the grand plans ahead in the mcu which is okay  i personally expected a little more  i also felt like the motivations of the villain were unclear for a large portion of the film  it was hard to feel connected to any particular cause  some of the dialogue was stilted  jokes landed less often than usual and there were a couple moments that took you out of the film  overall  it's a fun film with unique qualities that any fan of the genre should enjoy ,Positive
1170,"action capture system is truly awesome  i like this type of action movies   you can feel fight totally worth match in cenima  action 10/10
story 8/10 ",Positive
1171,honestly i start doubting that i saw another movie ! i don't know what all the hype about !! another marvel movie packed with a lot of action scenes and visual effects but weak and predictable story !,Positive
1172,first off  i actually rate this film 8 1/2 stars  (does anyone know if there a is a way to rate 1/2s?) the formula that worked so well in guardians vol  1  ant man & the wasp & ragnarok operates like clockwork in shang chi & 10 rings but even on a grander scale  a fun film to watch! solid story  defined/empathetic characters  sharp script laced with wit & humor throughout  thrilling action sequences  set pieces & special effects imagery  and michelle yeoh (in her 2nd mcu role) is impeccable as always  fight scenes choreographed & executed w/ precision reminiscent of crouching/dragon  the entire cast is perfect in fact  fast paced & easily re watchable film addition in the mcu ,Positive
1173,first hour had good unique action scenes  paired with typical marvel style comic jokes  but fails to deliver a strong finish  it failed to establish a true villain and a motive behind their actions  it took time to tell a back story but struggled with pacing and didn't fully develop the character to be cared for  in the end  i didn't care for the hero if he lived or died  when the credits rolled  didn't care if there's going to a sequel  shang chi unfortunately will work best as a a cameo in upcoming super hero movies  the movie failed to really separate from other super heroes in the universe ,Positive
1174,black widow was a really good movie  but this is what marvel is all about! amazing storyline  phenomenal action  and just the right amount of humor  this movie was an epic introduction to a character that i was previously unfamiliar with  the future is bright in the mcu ,Positive
1175,well definitely the best production by marvel following endgame  an absolute treat to watch  the main attraction is obviously the amazing fight sequence that's up there with the best fight scenes of mcu  and also the background music is perfectly fitting to the tone and setting of the film  what many might think that the plotline does not have enough depth  but i'd beg to differ as the way they've changed the shang chi character  introducing his father as the wielder of the ten rings and changing the power of the rings altogether is an amazing approach itself  the merging of different components and changing the storyline from the comics has been common in the mcu but none of them is as unique as shang chi  i'd say if they brought the original shang chi from the comics  then it would've been a mediocre movie  but they made every character unique  even the villain has a backstory to which everyone can relate  the fight sequences give goosebumps everytime i watch 'em  can't wait for the sequel!!!,Positive
1176,it's not an awful film but it's not good either  i thought the plot was weak  so we're the characters  the animation was okay but weak in points  it's definatly not in the league of other marvel films ,Negative
1177,bizarre character selection  the cast didn't gel at any time  weak attempts to link in previous marvel characters    presumably because they need some work over the covid years  the story was far fetched nonsense  marvel started with some good credible characters but continues its decline with this abomination ,Positive
1178,i have witnessed something way beyond my expectations  this movie is fully action packed and well directed  surely this is best part 1 movie of any franchise ,Positive
1179,i didn't expect a really good movie but this is really good really enjoyed myself even comedy is in it if you are a marvel fan then you really have to watch this ,Positive
1180,"i think the movie was very great it's the way how the comic book was in
good performance to bring the character to live action i read the comic book i noticed story i think it was a good story and a good movie ",Positive
1181,this movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other marvel antagonists  it shows his personal conflicts  his purpose  as well as his cruelty  the hero of this film are overshadowed by this  but the ending really makes a mark on the audience  also the martial arts and action scenes are a treat to watch and the core of the film is about family ,Positive
1182,"it was so bad that when i saw the end credit scene ""shang chi will return"" i automatically begged that it won't tony leung and michelle yeoh were the only two things that good about this movie  well them and the water dragon too whoever responsible for casting simu liu and ronny chiang did a very bad job  their acting was so awful  it was painful to see them on the movie ",Negative
1183,woow    am i the only one who finds this trash movie is only another stupid ??!?trash 10 usd movie   not worth popcorn   a huge a drop in story line comparing to marvel movies   marvel boys   this is the end of your career guys  sorry to say that ,Negative
1184,the movie tells a story about shang chi facing his destiny  they have done an excellent job of telling the backstory of his family  but it's a pity that the main story felt a little to short  the film has also represent the best fight choreography in the mcu  the fight scene were beautifully shot  but sometimes they cut my tension by throwing in some jokes and puts in too much cgi and it cheapens the fight scene  the jokes  music and the cgi works well in some places but also doesn't work well in some places especially during the third act  the visual in this film were great but in some scene it looks so cartoonish with this green screen stage area and it looks bad during the third act  while the movie does a great job telling a backstory of his family the film also manage to make us understand the villain motivation  the villain in this film might probably land in my top 5 best villain in the mcu verdict: shang chi and the legend of the ten ring might not be that great for me  is not that bad not that great  but enjoyable  8/10 ,Positive
1185,"   fast review: good effect  exciting figth scenes  satisfying story   > i normally don't like most marvel movies because bla bla  
> however  as a martial arts fan  performer and chinese culture and mythology fan  i decided to watch it (because there is use of martial arts) and unexpectedly satisfied > there is a good base  universe of chinese mythology  they may waste it but they definetly use it very well  effects are realy good  i especially like effects of portals and water tornado of dragon > fight scenes (which is the most interested part for me of course) are really good  some parts are so fast to detect movements > visual effects of kung fu (not style of main character but his mother and her people) describe the philosophy under the style very well  their kung fu is so smooth  basic and easily recognisable because most is traditional style >i was very happy when i saw some movements that i use ",Positive
1186,action packed  exciting and well acted  everything you should expect from a marvel movie and then some  simu liu and awkafina make a great combo and its always good seeing tony leung on screen  also good to see martial arts incorporated into the mcu ,Positive
1187,this movie could have been great  it has stellar choreography and visuals  but the character development  dialogue  and casting ruined the entire movie  every 10 minutes  there is a loud pointless raspy comment made by awkwafina  this ruined the entire movie  almost every joke and line was forced and cringe ,Positive
1188,first off  tony leung steals the movie  he's great as shang chi's father and the head of ten rings (and not the mandarin)  the movies starts as kind of jackie chan style action flick and morphs into kind of kaiju movie  kind wish it remain a straight kung fu movie  not a big fan how the finally scenes is huge cgi fight  i guess it wouldn't be an mcu movie without a cgi fight i felt the inclusion of wong was little force in the middle of the movie ,Positive
1189,watch it it's very good  it has the best fight scenes in any marvel movie ever with cgi on such a huge scale you would think it was an avengers movie  the music could be better as it lacks in that  but the action and the characters make up for it ,Positive
1190,best mcu movie so far in phase 4  more action  more adventure  and more fun    if you've watched and did nothing  i don't know what you just watched ,Positive
1191,it was amazing the fights the ten rings everything just wow ,Positive
1192,marvel productions are anything but boring  the film had good representation of the chinese culture and good visuals  but the plot was very indirect  full of gaps and unexplained things  shallow characterising  it's a certain thing until it turns out to be something else the next second  quick shifts in the plot  a bit of forced comedy too  and the lack of interesting hooks  this is a marvel disappointment ,Positive
1193,this one is a very solid entry into the marvel cinematic universe  great action and story that catches up with characters like wong and abomination  the movie definitely feels different than other marvel films and origin stories as it gives the villain some motivation that is understandable overall  the film is definitely one to watch  and is a great setup film for future mcu projects ,Positive
1194,usually i write a lot more in these reviews  i'm a 'see it on the first showing' for every marvel movie and series   and this has left me without any superlatives  amazing  10/10 ,Positive
1195,marvel studios apparently doesnt learn from its mistakes while they are profitable and makes another movie with tons of jokes instead of focussing on character development ,Positive
1196,this movie have a different and best action of all marvel movies    25       it is very beautiful vfx and cgi ,Positive
1197,not much to say it's a marvel movie see it for yourself  i went too the theaters and enjoyed this movie so much  i was never bored  don't get me started with the cg and characters also cinematography ,Positive
1198,all i can say about shang chi is that it is something fresh the actions sequences are very well choreographed  the music is pretty good and the performance of the cast does not disappoint ben kingsley as trevor is a total waste of the actor's potential marvel once again does not give a proper arc to the villain and so i felt nothing for him (and even shang chi) when he dies at the end the main problem with the movie is that it does not give a good motive for shang chi to become a superhero the film (like most superhero movies nowadays) is focused more on the super part of the character than the hero) ,Positive

1201,i would like to say that this is just a fantastic movie  the film has a lot of colors  an interesting and cool plot  the actors have worked out their roles to the fullest  leaves pleasant emotions after viewing  i advise everyone for an evening in a pleasant company or family circle  10/10 ,Positive
1202,"i will be honest  after the previews of this film i was not very enthusiastic  i didn't know this character from the marvel universe either when the movie started i quickly got a ""crouching tiger hidden dragon"" vibe  and i didn't mind at all  since that has been my favorite asian movie for a long time the film tells a beautiful story  does it with sense and humor and the fantastic special effects that are characteristic of marvel i quickly felt a bond with the three protagonists  and even the bad guy i could sympathize to a certain extent when the film was over i noticed that i immediately thought that this story could go much further i hope for a sequel!",Positive
1203,i sincerely doubt stan lee would be pleased with the way his character was totally remade for this crappy movie  it's truly bad unless you're a millennial and grew up playing video games ,Positive
1204,i wish marvel shows some balls with different genres  had so many expectations from this movie  wished its not yet another mediocre marvel movie  half way through i felt indifferent not gonna watch another marvel movie until they move the goddamn needle ,Negative
1205,"leon liang is a great actor known to asian audience and i didn't know his english was this good  and as expected  the acting was natural!the character of shang chi's dad really stole the show   you get to understand where he's coming from and instead of a pure evil being like the comic books depicts  he's now just a man in flesh & bones and desperate in getting his lost lover back the action was really good considering yuen wah was in it he probably contributed a lot there  it feels like a jackie chan movie (even the iconic scenes of fights in the scaffolding is there!!!) and there's not stupid angle cuts and stuff like shots of a fist and then another second someone's flying  instead you get the complete scene where multiple ppl are fighting and there's no offscreen cuts over all  the breakdown:
graphics: 9 (lucas studio was behind it)
story: 7 5
action: 8 5will watch again  probably will buy the 4k bluray as well ",Positive
1206,honestly some of the worst acting i've ever seen  actually unwatchable  i understand hollywood has to be diverse but get actors that can do the job! the worst marvel film ever and there has been some right stinkers  just stop now disney  it's too much  4 films a year  4 series  save your gd ideas and make one or 2 good films don't waste your time ,Negative
1207,good movie  fun as it has to be a superhero flick  great martial arts scenes  cgi was pretty decent  good actors and performances  the story wasn't what i was expecting  but you can't put the whole family drama that the main character has in 2 hours  what really bothered me was awkwafina  wtf? what is she doing in there the whole time? i'm tired of these silly non important characters that ruin everything  she should've stayed in california and disappear  fun movie tho  also    disney stop ruining our good stuff!!!!!,Positive
1208,"disclaimer #1: i'm simply burned out on marvel  i'm a lifelong fan of cinema  but i'm not a purist to the extent that i feel i have to choose between scorsese or superheroes  sometimes i'm in the mood for one and sometimes i'm in the mood for the other  disclaimer #2: i was an avid comic book collector from the time i was about 10 until i was about 38  in fact  i made an oath to myself in my younger years that i would never stop loving comics and comic books  disclaimer #3: i'm now 46 at the time of this writing  i've done a lot of growing up since i stopped collecting comics  and even more growing up since i was 10  i'm not a kevin smith  kevin smith is a loser  and this is just my opinion  so take it however you want  but the adults running around living for this endless stream of cinematic crap  doing youtube reaction videos for trailers  and their subscribers are also losers  (i'm trying for the guinness book record of downvotes here )i tried to give this movie a chance because it was free on disney + (which i only have for my 6 year old daughter) and i was bored to death within 10 minutes  not just bored to death but knowing i was wasting my time on just more juvenile garbage  so i turned it off  then i was with my daughter  and i thought  ""aha! i know just the movie she would love to see!"" and guess what? she thinks it's amazing so there you go  losers  all of you grown people are delirious over a cartoon for 6 year olds  congratulations oh  and i've been to san fran  and it was a rathole 15 years ago  i hear it's even rat holier now  talk about your completely unrealistic childish fantasies   the portrayal of san francisco in this as anything less than a dumpster is the epitome of it ",Positive
1209,marvel ne poora china bana diya!whr the hell is xi jinping in this?can't digest this movie in marvel universe!its a shame          aisi 10 chudiyan humare yaha sab ladies pehenti hain ,Neutral
1210,"how can i describe how much i love this movie?! i loved it! by far the best superhero movie of the year (until spider man: no way home comes out) i grew up reading marvel comics (thanks dad for the many visits to the local library)  that's how i became a huge fan of spider man  batman  superman  the avengers  etc  and shang chi was one of those comics i read growing up  i watched so many bruce lee movies and wished that he was still alive to have at least played shang chi back in the day  but then i got my wish this year!i really enjoyed the story of this film and it gives the backstory of the ten rings organization  as depicted first in 2008's iron man  tony yeong was amazing as wenwu  the og mandarin in the comics  he was just a father that wanted to reunite with his family and bring back his dead wife to be a family again  and i loved simu liu as shang chi  he bodied the character very well and i loved the banter between him and awkwafina's character  i thought awkwafina was gonna be annoying at first  but then i grew to love her character  i'm happy that shang chi and katy weren't love interests in this one  but i don't mind if we see them as a couple in the next one (and there will definitely be a next shang chi film)  it was a surprise that i get to see abomination back in his true comic accurate form! and wong fighting him?! come on  that's awesome! ben kingsley was a surprise to see  i loved him in this more than when he was ""acting"" as the mandarin in iron man 3  i really liked shang chi's sister  xialing  who is a badass by the way  i loved the story and the characters and oh my god  the score and visuals was stunning!i loved the choreography of the many styles of kung fu  the fighting was just spot on from what i've seen watching the bruce lee films  and i got to admit  wenwu was an amazing villain  i put him up there with thanos  killmonger  loki  mysterio  vulture  red skull and ego the living planet overall  i give shang chi and the legend of the ten rings a solid 10/10 ",Positive
1211,the chinese characters pictured in this film feel weird and very few commons with the chinese people living in china  neither do the language/dialects they choose to use in it i won't call it stereotype but would really appreciate it if people don't keep saying this is about promoting chinese culture besides  martial arts are not magic to the common population in china ,Negative
1212,suffice to say  i enjoy all sorts of superhero movies  they're just so colorful with everyone dressed in otherworldly costumes and above all that  i even get to see creatures which don't exist and would never in my lifetime anyway  shang chi was slightly different in the sense that thought it started off showing the past of an immortal man  it moved to modern day america and focused on two friends who were as normal as any millennial you'd meet outside on the streets today  it got wierd soon after though  as it should my favourite part of the movie was how the redemption arc for ten rings worked out perfectly  he really wasn't that bad as a father to begin with i'm looking forward to more from this franchise ,Positive
1213,i was told the first scene was epic  i thought it was boring and somewhat ridiculous  i get that the rings were powerful but you just can't run full force into an army solo  i know his force followed but there is a point where he throws a soldier into the air and the others just watch  i would also like a dubbed version  action movies with subtitles are not good viewing to me ,Negative
1214,within the first fifteen minutes  this film manages to cram in some second rate cgi shots  a horrendous wire fu/ballroom dance debacle  and the reinforcing of several stereotypes about asians  no  thanks ,Positive
1215,a movie which you have to watch with your brain switched off  if you are someone who looks for a half decent plot and storyline  don't waste your time!!there is only one marvel movie which is worse the crap known as iron man 3 which is why it's not surprising there is a link between it and this train wreck ,Negative
1216,waited for cinemas to open from lockdown  and this movie was amazing to watch on the big screen  the story is great  the actors fit perfectly  the action scenes are crazy good  the camera movement in the film in fight scenes is absolutely phenomenal!,Positive
1217,after being disappointed by black widows' solo outing and not knowing anything about a minor comics character i feared for shang chi  but i was not disappointed straight off and you get a cultured vibe honouring asian film and tradition and you get superb action and charismatic characters all well delivered by a strong cast reminding me of jackie chan in his heyday  the martial arts is fast and creative  shang chi feels really grounded and fresh for the first half of the film and it's good to move away from too much wild  but then the second half blends asian folklore and marvel fantasy to truly deliver a spectacle  without having to explain itself too deeply the consistent nods to dr strange remind you that other dimensions exist and people can bend powers in believable ways whilst it may not have needed to go so far onto fantasy  any true marvel fan knows this is just another tuesday  the performances are strongly delivered and shang chi is likely to become a new fan favourite ,Positive
1218,"i've never been the biggest fan of marvel movies  however shang chi is a legit bonafide classic  it's like goonies meets harry potter  never ending story   meets okja crouching tiger hidden dragon   meets princess mononoke    meets the secret garden   meets the raid   and every akira kurosawa film (it's a lot more in depth with legit asian film history then that but i need films you knew) it's a legit a+  10 out of 10  👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿 up for the whole family and for art appreciators  it's seriously the best blockbuster movie that reps the craft and uses the best medium for storytelling to the masses (film) of the last few yrs  it mixes adventure  fantasy  mysticism  non cultural appropriation2non americanized martial arts  every aspect of classic cinematography  oscar winning acting with up and comers  non cheesy non forced humor for all
ages  and superb pacing and storytelling  it makes every other marvel film look like trash  it's like a pixar x studio ghibli movie but with real life actors   it's tugs on the nostalgia heartstrings through emotional suggestion w/ a hint of that original feeling; you remember that genuine hope/amazement that's always missing with the ""in your face recycling"" of the exact same bs in every other modern blockbuster leaching off the nostalgia tit  it's really something special ",Positive
1219,i have seen this movie 4 times now and i think it gets better with each viewing  i am a big marvel fan and this one definitely didn't disappoint  perfect combination of action  humor and heart  simu is amazing in this film and i really look forward to seeing him in a project with tom holland  anthony mackie and sebastian stan! solid job destin daniel cretton  can't wait to see the disney plus show!,Positive
1220,you'll get: vibrant colors & mographyou won't get: blood  hardcore and feeling of being an adult watching something that wasn't made for kids it's ok  it was always like that ,Positive
1221,it's very meh    the cgi is very cringe at times  but it has its audience  i get that  just didn't care for the characters  the plot  the mystery  nice to see trevor slattery though  and the fight scenes are cool  it definitely has its audience which is cool  but so far it's 0/2 for the new marvel phase (including eternals),Positive
1222,fair origin film  generally  marvel's character introduction films are slightly above average affairs  they need to introduce a character that some people may not be familiar with  this usually leads to a lengthy stretch of the beginnings of those movies to be slow  this movie  however  felt like it kicked off fairly quickly and maintained a decent pace  after the ramp up to infinity war and endgame  and bombastic  wild action in them  this movie feels like a step back  however  you need to keep in mind that this is the beginning of a new story arc in the mcu  build up is necessary  in that regard  this movie is a success with that said  i do have a few gripes awkwafina grated on my ears and nerves for the whole movie  a personal preference  i don't remove a star for that many of the action sequences were well done but filmed with the cameras too close  had they been filmed from a greater distance they would have been more impressive and flowed better overall that's pretty much it  i found it to be one of the better origin films  nothing spectacular  but it was very watchable ,Positive
1223,enjoyable movie  not sure how if you don't like iron fist on netflix how you will like this movie though  it's the same ideas almost same writing  glad mcu is fixing the 10 rings and the mandarin    sort of ,Positive
1224,as a huge fan of the ip man and marvel movies i feel that this movie was a beautiful balance between insane action and beautiful backdrops and wonderful mystical powers  growing up watching old school kung fu movies and then finding superhero movies on my own and loving them  i feel this movie is a perfect blend of everything i want from modern action cinema ,Positive
1225,this movie has everything done right   comedy ( it's funny and hilarious)   action ( graphics and fighting sequences)   background music   sound tracks excellent direction  screenplay   good chemistry between the actorsmovie is totally worth it ,Positive
1226,this was great to watch  and up to the middle i was thinking this could be one of the best marvel movies  the action and story was great the only thing was the ending seemed a bit typical of a lot of not great marvel movies  just a big fight to draw it all to a conclusion  guardians  winter soldier and loki seem totally memorable for the characters more than the epic conclusion was a great movie  but marvel have done more interesting ,Positive
1227,"at first  it felt like i am watching not a mcu movie: it felt just different clearly  shang chi targets the china market and invites us to embrace the chinese culture and suddenly  i liked that part about the movie  i've watched few chinese movies and yet i like this one a lot pros:
cool action  scenes and music  actually a decent plot  a thorough backstory (given the movie runtime) cons:
what i really dislike in recent mcu movies is that there is always that one person who is damn silly and ridiculous but is never fun for me: they are always apparent and it's totally clear what's their role in the movie   to make you laugh by their silly jokes and them being sort of 'the third wheel'  i feel cringe  sorry speaking of visuals and unique creations: it didn't impress me  instead  it felt somewhat underwhelming  i am not saying it was terrible but i definitely seen better vfx production in the mcu and my expectations are higher than what we get in shang chi in conclusion  shang chi and the legend of the ten rings impressed me and at the same time slightly disappointed me in the end  it was just a good one for me ",Positive
1228,xu wenwu might just be marvel's best villain  he has done unforgivable things  but motives are entirely sympathetic  the movie does a great job of showing him as a human being and not just some agent of evil  part of that is the writing  but a huge chunk of the credit goes to tony leung's performance all of the performances are top notch  despite taking place in such a heightened reality  they all feel very grounded and human  the friendship and love between shang chi and katy in particular feels completely natural  especially in those scenes at her home in san francisco hong kong action films have a reputation for a kind of creativity that a lot of hollywood films lack  traditionally a hollywood fight scene could change it's setting  or the people in it  and you wouldn't notice a difference  because they're planned without taking the character or environment into account  in hong kong action they use the character's clothes  everyday objects  parts of the environment  so that particular fight could only have taken place with those particular characters in those particular environments  hollywood's gotten better at it over the years  and shang chi is a wonderful example  you couldn't transplant that bus fight between shang chi and razorfist onto a dock  or swap out razorfist for bushwacker  they also go all in on the balletic wuxia style fight choreography  with water and leaves and other elements of the environment flowing along with the fighter's movements like all mcu films  it drags a bit in the tail end with it's very long battle filled with cgi performances  the use of large empty arenas   the gate platform  the lake  the sky   makes it feel a little less grounded  and a little more hollywood than the other battle scenes  it would have been nice for them to have some more distinct features for the characters to interact with   statuary like the story wall shown earlier in the film  for example  an especially wasted opportunity for the parts of the battle taking place in the village  which was full of architecture and decoration that could have been put to creative use  but there's still enough quality fight choreography to keep you interested there's also a couple of fun post credits sequences   i was already all in on any shang chi sequels  but these were wonderful teasers for what may be coming ,Positive
1229,if this movie's reviews are legit  then there is no hope left for humanity poor script  no substance  overlydramatic for no reason  a ridiculous mix of us comedy and chinese action could only take 48 min of it and i gave up ,Negative
1230,"it is a story of self discovery  full of great character arcs  glorious fight scenes and the cinematography  choreography  plot   it could not have been done better  simu liu really shines as the main character: he brings so much charm to the role that it's easy to grow fond of him  cgi and the fight scenes were stunning!the perfect start for phase 4 (i know  the start is with black widow but is something ""old"")marvel hasn't made such a masterpiece since black panther ",Positive
1231,awesome all star all asian american cast  100!! this is the best marvel film they have made  beistifl scenery and the martial arts fight scenes were such a breath of fresh air from the typical scenes we normally see ,Positive
1232,action scenes are really well choreographed but this movie i felt brought nothing novel to me  i didn't feel thrilled or excited while watching this movie ,Positive
1233,action packed movie with comedy    and the kamehameha     ,Positive
1234,"if mario puzo or truman capote were to write a fantasy it would feel like this  or if lewis carroll were to write a crime drama it would feel like this  ""shang chi"" is  in essence  this sort of fascinating  singularly unique and audacious combination wrapped up in a wildly entertaining martial arts film  ""shang chi"" feels like no other mcu production because of this interplay of seemingly dissimilar elements  but  where else could one possibly come across such an engrossing mix than in the marvel cinematic universe  where a raccoon once sent e mails to a russian assassin? that's the beauty of ""shang chi;"" it propels quite enthusiastically and energetically into this vast inexplicable new terrain which only stan lee and his fellow artists and creators could have envisioned or foretold  an extraordinary offering from marvel studios  ""shang chi"" is a must see!",Positive
1235,nothing new  typical storyline  weak and all too familiar coupled with some bad dialogues  and that all was drowned out by the special effects galore  yeah  the cgi takes center stage   well  almost the whole stage the casting doesn't quite work for me except for tony leung  he was great  ben kingsley  michelle yeoh and the village leader were there to sell tickets  they were unnecessary big names in small roles that could have been filled with lesser names  the main roles however   could have been better  simu liu and awkfina lack the star power  the attraction  the draw was this a bad movie though? not really  it was entertaining enough although i lost interest somewhere near the hour mark  it was already obvious by then how the story will unfold  could have been much better ,Positive
1236,"technically strong movie  all action scenes are amazing    cg was superb  fun and emotional mixed entertainer   
welcome on board a new av✨💥✨r  
over all shangi chi awesome ",Positive
1237,yes  put kungfu  dj & instrumental music and awsome graphics in a blender  i'm gonna chug it down even if it turns out to be broccoli or walnut smoothee ( or kashayam in my native language)  the story is plain  but these things didn't make it noticeable  a grand welcome to the new avengers (hopefully) inductee ,Positive
1238,one of the best marvel's film but in india it should be released in 3d for the best experience otherwise it is a good movie ,Positive
1239,such a very beautiful movie in all aspects  there's a good story  there's an excellent acting  there are really funny jokes  and i was shocked when i knew that the budget of it is just $150m because the cgi was perfect and it's really hard to do but they did and they well done  at the end it's a very good debut for a new hero into the mcu and i can't wait until i see how the future of shang chi will be with the rest of the avengers ,Positive
1240,all in all shang chi is a decent and amusing superhero movie but it doesn't offer anything more than that  i have to admit that marvel and daniel cretton have done a good job on combining eastern (more specifically chinese) culture  myths and action style of filmmaking with normal western superhero cinema  action and fighting scenes are pleasant and innovative as we all have expected  the cast and performances are also very good and among the positive aspects of the movie however  despite this progress  the script and characterisation are still the same old thing  the movie begins very well but after one hour it becomes just like all other marvel films  sudden changes and developments in characters  illogical decisions  unexplained details and predictable ending makes the movie completely forgettable  for me  the cgi is still not 100% compelling and gets annoying at some places ,Positive
1241,perfect casting  great flow throughout  solid story and character development  great movie to take the family to watch  provides many topics for conversation change for the better  start doesn't dictate the end  see the good in all  cherish our loved ones and many others  for me the mark of a really good movie is the can't wait for the next movie and i can't wait for chapter two!!,Positive
1242,this film was beyond what i thought it was  yeah it has some forced jokes and some pacing problems but these get overshadowed by the rich story   emotions and actions  the first half gives you a good setup and stunning hand to hand fights while the second half gives gorgeous scenes   creatures and fights   the dragon fight at end was just wow and the way the rings were used sometimes like spiderman and sometimes an invisible chair is so good   plus i think it has one of the great post credit scenes  it needs to be enjoyed in the biggest screen possible with 3d ,Positive
1243,there has been some great additions to the mcu so far this year and phase 4 is definitely an experimental phase; shang chi is no exception visuals are pretty great along with great characters and acting  shang chi himself was overshadowed by wenwu (the mandarin) in the trailers which didn't give you a good idea about the character but he shines in the film wenwu also manages to be a great villain  with a sympathetic drive to his villainy he manages to avoid the 1 dimensional template past mcu villains unfortunately fall into  his death put his story full circle the film also manages to do a lot of world building in its 2 hour and 12 minute runtime in an impressive and not rushed way trevor slaterey was a character that split the fan base in the middle when iron man 3 debuted but when we know the real mandarin exists his character can be less divisive  he still remains a hilarious character and they don't forget his position as a liverpool fan  his planet of the apes monologue was somewhat emotional for a kind of dumb scene and was well acted the action is brilliant especially for the bus fight  the final fight with the rings was a fun and unique fight however the great protector vs dweller in darkness was a good looking yet somewhat boring fight that felt as if it didn't fit in the film and the hand to hand fights were brilliant both credit scenes are brilliant and the mid credit scene is one of the best in the mcu with appropriate cameos that leave you excited for the future  it also connects the film to the wider mcu  the second scene was great and allows excitement for the sequel to rise overall the film is great and has some great character moments however the final fight ends in a chi mess that perhaps didn't belong in the film ,Positive
1244,the film really went well from beginning to the end  it was really great with the visuals  the bus action sequence was great and visually was a treat to watch  simu liu did great as shang chi climax is something which you should be most awaited for  cheers for the whole the team of shang chi ,Positive
1245,i must say this is definitely one of the better marvel instalments  its a fantastic thrill ride from start to finish were the ancient world of chinese martial arts intertwines with the ever developing marvel universe   jackie chan like martial arts brings comedy to the fight scenes and we mite be looking at the new hidden dragon here in simu liu who mite possess the potential to fill a martial arts void left behind by the masters lee   chan   li & yen  the ten rings are powerful and yet their power lies within the wielder so the balance between good and evil will depend on who wears them   hidden worlds   mythical dragons   magic & sorcery will it be enough to repel an ancient evil buried in time or will the 10 rings be possessed by a new spirit hidden in the heritage of ancient people  brilliantly executed adventure and gives hope to the marvel universe so i say more of the same for future projects because i was getting worried ,Positive
1246,the story suc*s literally     visual effects were pretty nice as usual  some lame a*s jokes and dialogues and          !ohh that's all!if you observe this closely  you will also notice this movie had the tendency of antagonizing male characters and making female characters look good(although no one would care for it as it's only bad for men)   also very typical of marvel    ,Negative
1247,it was really a great experience seeing this movie in cinema  great visuals  action sequences and story  there is also no obscene scene (kissing and sexual activities) so great from that prospective too  only thing that wasn't good about it was overuse of chinese language in this film  both mid credit and post credit scenes are amazing too ,Positive
1248,a little sceptical at first as this came in user the radar with no real build up and hype like previous mcu films  however  it did not disappoint  decent storyline with brilliantly choreographed (and obligatory far fetched) fight scenes post film credits setting up for the next dr strange and shang chi films  can't wait!!,Positive
1249,i fully enjoyed this film  it's good to see that phase 4 has some hope to carry on the mcu  it's got the good classic elements of marvel films while introducing new likeable characters and a fun story ,Positive
1250,the first 2 acts were funny and action packed and they had good villain so what's the problem the problem is i didn't know i was watching marvel movie till wong was in it  and the 3rd act with all the dragon stuff and the father turning good nice redemption arc but then they threw away good villain so he could fight a cgi monster wich by the way why couldn't his aunt defeat him if she knew the moves why did she teach shung chi it wasn't a satisfying ending and there wasn't a threat and all that crazy fighting for what all that soulsucker needed was arrow to throat (it's cool he's first asian superhero on screen but doesn't mean this was great marvel movie)but if was own movie i probably would have rated this higher it's not thor the dark world bad but it's between captain marvel and antman overall ok ,Positive
1251,i have seen best movie after endgame   awesome movie and great visuals   marvel you are beauty ,Positive
1252,easily the worst marvel film along with black widow  awful characters specifically katy  who's as annoying and pointless as jar jar or rose from star wars ,Negative
1253,i loved the aesthetics of the movie  the score  the acting  the story  one of the strongest marvel films i've seen in a long time ,Positive
1254,i didn't expect it to be good so the outcome was estonishing i really liked it was funny had great fighting the charecters were good the bad guy was good overall the movie was great ,Positive
1255,rush hour + crouching tiger + aquaman it might be the most entertaining movie since winter soldier the movie was almost great  but the standard marvel formula drags it down ,Positive
1256,so shang chi has an evil kung fu father with sci fi bracelets and an air bender mother  he leaves his father behind to pursue a simpler chilled life in sam francisco and then they the fathers organization attacks him and brings him back to have him help and get to his mothers home village  in the village he fights his father and wins and then fights anime looking monsters which are like dementors/ soul suckers  he gets help from a water bending dragon and defeats the king monster by performing an exorcism with his bracelets  acting wasn't amazing but let's all appreciate how cool morris was  probably the best character in the movie ,Positive
1257,finally! a movie that celebrates chinese heritage and contributions  and doesn't look down on all the beautiful art  culture  music and everything else this fine continent has produced  everything about this movie was phenomenal  the special effects were obviously mind blowing  but the acting was the absolute best part  i never saw a comic book movie with this much powerhouse performances  they all did so good  i will see this movie again and again  i can't wait for sequels! also so proud of simi liu for breaking all the stereotypes and painting the most gorgeous picture of chinese life  and everything it can be  such a riveting story from start to end  lovedddddd it ,Positive
1258,one of the best marvel movie i have ever seen  great job marvel  simu liu i love you  your performance is just brilliant just brilliant  magnificent  the story the action sequences the vfx cgi it's just great and i didn't expect the post credit scene this good  bruce banner captain marvel❤,Positive
1259,great movie with awesome acting and stunts  good jokes throughout the movie aswell  the story was awesome and im definitely looking forward to the future of the mcu ,Positive
1260,before getting into any of the review stuff  congratulations to the whole cast and crew of shang chi and the legend of the ten rings this film is unlike any other marvel project however  this was an absolute wonder the potrayal of the every character was flawless  perfectly casted each and every person visually very engaging  i loved the cgi it was amazing the chinese culture was very well demonstrated which was a beautiful scene to watch people should definitely go and watch this    it's worth the theatre experience very well done marvel studios with this film even though the pandemic is hampering with the collection    i feel like this has been a blockbuster once again congratulations to the entire cast and crew there's a new hero on the block!!marvel studios shang chi and the legend of the ten rings ,Positive
1261,for the first time  the fight with two people was so amazing  but the farther  the more boring  too many characters and effects have made the movie a mess and not very real ,Positive
1262,great action fantasy adventure with a compelling story arc  the storyline is great  a compelling villain  and an amazing marvel origin story  great comedic timing  great cinematography  and amazing fight sequences  the music in this was perfect for the movie and the character arc  a satisfying and awesome climax  a great action film to watch ,Positive
1263,an awesome action adventure fantasy movie with great comedic timing and a compelling storyline and character arc  one of the best marvel origin story's ever  satisfying climax and one of the best choreography ever  great cgi  music  and cinematography  a great compelling storyline that leaves you on the edge of your seat  the villain and hero have a great relationship that leaves you with mixed feelings about the good vs hero dynamic  in the end awesome film ,Positive
1264,the first 2/3 of the film are pretty strong  the story is well laid out and the battle scenes look good  the last third of the film is just typical marvel again  a boring cgi fight in which the brilliantly staged martial arts fights are simply forgotten beforehand in addition  i miss the character development of the main character shang   chi and the girlfriend of shang chi is just a gag relief where most of the jokes do not ignite  i also found the film too predictable to stand out is the villain  one of the mcu's strongest villains in my opinion ,Positive
1265,best movie ever  and best debut for marvel character shang chi and simu liu  i hope they make 2 more sequels like shang chi ii and shang chi iii and also in crossover movies  simu liu can be done he next back bone of mcu after tony stark and steve rogers ,Positive
1266,"i was surprised by how good it was i had great humor and good action and it had surprisingly good acting i recommend this movie to whoever says this movie isn't good you should watch overall a
good movie ",Positive
1267,it is a pretty standard marvel movie with a similar formula for their films so there wasn't something that really stuck out to me this time  the story is so so and there is way too much cgi  in my opinion cgi is very overrated and should only be used in correct circumstances  but cgi was all over the place and i was growing not too fond with the backgrounds and settings  the characters were pretty good though and i felt like marvel tried with this movie so i have to give it that  it's just there is nothing too spectacular to make me come back to it when there are plenty of other marvel greats that essentially have the same story ,Positive
1268,as title said  if later in a mcu movie  it is needed to watch it to know a bit more of his history then go ahead  this movies sucks  i have never been so disappointed with a marvel movie as this one  exclude those early early ones  let me point out a few probables  the story doesn't even make much sense  or even doesn't interested me  same old storyboard  similar run through  expected ending  nothing surprises me  second  the main actor simu  damm a lot to improvement  in acting skill  wise  watching close ups of his fighting scenes literally made this movie a comedy  the lack of expression  doesn't connect with the character  i'd prefer wen wu a lot more than shang chi  in actor of course  wen wu's actor is probably one of the rarest thing in the movie that would add points to the rating  i can tell he is very experienced  he can fully express the characters feeling  emotion and status to the audience personally can't believe they already signed a second movie with that main actor  but who knows what kevin feige is thinking ,Positive
1269,this movie is meaningful  one can be enlightened that human desires are the only thing that can trap a hero regardless how moral he is or how power he can be  when a life can reach the realm of no desires  nothing can stop him from reaching eternity ,Positive
1270,to sum up this movie  i can say it wasn't imposing  the characters did not feel entirely fleshed out  and the plot is just the usual formula of a hero action adventure movie  unfortunately  it does not cover personal growth and overcoming obstacles  furthermore  many plot conveniences push the story  rather than progressing and including the conveniences as something accidental this movie does not feature any known marvel characters and does not make the audience invested in the newly introduced ones  also  the film feels the need to make something epic happen on screen  after avengers endgame  the marvel franchise needs to one up themselves  therefore the antagonists of the movie seem a bit artificial and do not deliver a convincing reason for doing what they do in conclusion  this movie is mediocre at best and does not deserve a watch ,Positive
1271,i have seen it at the premier  3d is recommended  it seems marvel is siding toward mystic and magic instead of science  as i am a hardcore marvel fan since my childhood  i liked it  specially the bus fight scene  don't know about casual watchers ,Positive
1272,too long  too little story  bad cgi (except for the d*****  which was good)  too many hollow and/or annoying dialogues we were bored during the whole movie  painfully realizing how empty it was going to be after the plot is finally revealed  after 20 minutes of waiting where the heck this movie was trying to take us don't bother ,Negative
1273,"i didn't expect too much about the story and effects with the trailer  deep into the movie you will find an excellent ""matrix"" effects  deep story describing each caracter  awesome martial arts fights! a movie to enjoy from beginning to the end and after the end  waiting the second part!",Positive
1274,super disappointing  after the bus fight scene things just got worse and worse  once the flying dragon started flying around never ending story style it was over for me ,Negative
1275,this is one of the best marvel films  great visual arts  great story  wonderful family film  awesome movie ,Positive
1276,"not sure where to put this movie  the terrible cgi and bad general directing of the movie is a hard part to stay focused on   
it feels like the cringy sterotype asian wannabe bruce lee rip off the horrible cgi kicks in the fights and the general boring storyline from the starts makes it hard to say something good about this movie milking the frenchise in true disney spirit ",Negative
1277,i'll just start by the 2 stars lost  i hate movies that depict human like heros that don't bother to have any scratch or signs of physical damage when thrown on a wall by a super powerful hit from a vilan controling a rare artifact we are greeted with a true human being just trained to be good at receiving hits  that still does not mean his body has healing super powers or anti scratch skin  that's my top downfall for this movie as for the rest  the movie did an excellent job to introduce the story and plot while still keeping some mystery  it also did not spend too much time in the character development so the movie did not seem to have long scenes  special effects were well done  although  you cannot remove the lighting lacks of cgi when interacting with real humans i think this is a nice movie to watch because of a nice oriental twist to the marvel univers  refreshing with some solid foundations for futur movies to come  so good job on this movie and worth to watch even if you never watched a marvel movie  you won't get too lost in the plots since shang chi is a movie of it's own with a nice futur!,Positive
1278,this movie is an awful money grab from marvel that takes advantage of the typical stereotypes against asians the movie presents itself like some white knight movie that advances the portrayal of asians in cinema  when in reality it does the exact opposite by heavily utilizing the exact same set of stereotypes and motifs in the film this movie should not have been called progress for asians in cinema  but rather an insult to the asian culture ,Negative
1279,i went in with a moderate expectation thinking this movie would be the typical predictable disney film  but i was wrong and blown away both by the complex story line and the freaking awesome choreography martial arts  the film is exciting from the beginning  the acting and the chemistry between characters are captivating  especially between shang chi and katy  the cinematography is flawless  thoroughly enjoyed the movie  10/10 ,Positive
1280,film is great overrall  same story we all know but the way it told is engaging and emotional  first thing i loved in this movie is action sequence  every action scene is so damn good  the soundtrack is amazing  the characters are well written  even a smaller role is kinda memorable  vfx is great but not in high standards in final climax  its not that messy but notable  there are two credits scenes dont miss that  it does what it meant to do(entertainment)  cant wait for further mcu movies ,Positive
1281,"shang chi and the legend of the ten rings (2021)well what a pleasant surprise  very much in the style of black panther  this origin story was really great from start to finish i saw this at the 3d 4dx at the o2 and we were thrown about  blown on  rained on and every other sensation at every turn it was fab u lus!we had some great acting some great humour and plenty of ""magic""  for marvel fans after the lacklustre black widow  the disaster of the winter soldier  two goodens in a row what with snake eyes!the fight scenes we well worked through and the opening bus sequence was very memorable  i don't thing there was anything i didn't like about this movie so i'm giving 10 outta 1 ",Positive
1282,marvel was at its peak during the endgame phase now were at a point where marvel is trying to produce anything that looks like a super hero into a movie or tv series this should have been an exciting film and there is nothing wrong the cast but to be honest this film is a snooze fest  it is so long and drawn out i found myself looking at the time to see when it was actually finished  the main problem with this film is is tries to hard ,Positive
1283,i just re watched shang chi on disney+  and i enjoyed it as much as i did the first time in the theater  this movie redefines action in the mcu  and i hope it carries over into the new films going forward the first ten minutes are all in chinese with subtitles  yes  there is exposition and flashbacks in the movie as you're not going to understand the nuances of the plot  character motivations  etc  without it  it's called storytelling  get over it  there are references to cultural identity (as immigrants)  family  and love awkwafina and simu have great chemistry  menger is badass  tony leung is a legend and gives a wonderful performance as a complicated and tortured antagonist  there is great humor (not to everyone's liking it seems) and heart  my only critique is really the usual devolvement into the cgi battlefest that mcu movies always wind up becoming  but that's a minor quibble in a solid movie ,Positive
1284,imagine a movie with well timed jokes and action pacing sequences crossed with the magical world of asian mythology and kung fu and you got shang chi  10/10 ,Positive
1285,this is the first movie to see in theaters since covid 19 and let me tell you something  the movie is visually stunning and i mean the graphics  cinematography  and the colorful nature of macau  the acting was great and had some heart (better in my opinion than black widow) especially simu liu  awkwafina  meng'er zhang  tony chiu wai leung  and michelle yoeh  the soundtrack was very good  the film has some morals (something that i like to have in movies) like family and history protection  and the asian issues in america  at the end  it's a very good movie to see in theaters with family  i give the movie 10/10 ,Positive
1286,just came back from the theater  definitely great movie  another blockbuster and big win for marvel  hugely entertaining   it's as good as black panther shangchi original story line is about revenge and blood for blood  much more serious than other marvel themes  however  the emotions are diluted to the minimum because of his girlfriend kathy aka awkwafina  i guess that's on purpose  also mandarin aka wenwu his father is much less evil than the original  basically just a powerful guy losing mind for his beautiful wife  shangchi himself has a funny character as well  so it's become a popcorn movie but still deep with emotions  best marvel movie since the winter soliderthe only little regret for me is simu liu's outlook  man the face only deserves parking cars  i know jackie chan is also not good looking but shangchi to me is very handsome guy whose face is at least at the level of donnie yen  come on  he's a comic book super hero it's already making history by breaking record of labor day sales of any movie  and it's three times more  actually this movie is very hard to fail  you got michelle yeoh the female jackie chan  tony leung best actor in hk even china  awkwafina the best chinese/ asian american actress  fala chan very good actress in hk  etc  this is a dream cast like the new lakers ,Positive
1287,you could be mistaken for reading the title and thinking i was being sarcastic thankfully i'm not  just wow  i've been longing for that wow factor from the cinema since cinemas have reopened and this film gave me everything i wanted take away the fact that i am biased towards marvel movies (guilty) this however is just a fanboy loving that marvel have delivered once again  by that i mean top tier movies in the realms of black panther  thor 3  gotg  infinity wars  spider man just to name a few from not having any major comic runs  to coming to our screens with this is jaw dropping movie  i can only show nothing but pure joy  from the culture  the mythical folklore  the mix of past/present and let's not forget the secret garden this film expands on the marvel universe once again with an even deeper history this film gave me real belly laughs  real emotional moment  a fantastic soundtrack to match this is a genuine winner for this year and spider man may have his hands full beating what i can only describe as the best introduction to a unknown character since bp/gotg  shang chi needs to be a new staple in the marvel franchise with new stories moving forward  not to mention that fantastic performance from simu liu which has genuinely made me yearn for more of his portrayal!what an absolute treat and i've only watched it twice with a third viewing feeing more needed as the days go on 5 star all day  every day  bravo!,Positive
1288,i did not think marvel could put out more junk like winter soldier  this is as bad or worse  couldn't even watch  pure golden garbage  music  acting and special effects are horrible ,Negative
1289,i have no idea of what the story of this character is in the comics  but the way it was depicted in this movie was okay ish at most  and is barely entertaining  thanks to the usual aaa sfx not sure if this is supposed to please asian people with their full asian cast (i don't count cameos)  the same way black panther was to black people but i pretty much find it ridiculous everytime a movie does this sort of thing ,Positive
1290,seems movies no longer require a good coherent story anymore to be rated as a 'good movie'  just throw in some special effects and over the top fighting scenes and you are good to go  no matter how poor the writing might be at points the first fight scene near the very beginning made me think this movie was going to be something different  something good  maybe even a bit special as it turned out  it was definitely different when compared with other films made previously from the mcu  just not in the way i had hoped very disneyfied in the end  but the new modern day disney not the old one  they are certainly applying their own style to things now  great one for the kids    probably ,Positive
1291,the better mcu films feel like they could be a part of our world  with a splash of the fantastic  this film went full fantasy and was way too light hearted and sanitized i honestly felt little to nothing for these characters  which is a bit sad for how much feige was hyping it ,Positive
1292,this film would have been so much better if they didn't constantly carry on about how much better women are than men i cannot give examples without spoilers hollyweird must ruin everything they touch ,Positive
1293,this film felt refreshing and didn't feel too much like a marvel movie  felt like i was just watching a mythological modern film i had a good time watching it  only downside was some of the cgi felt very rushed at some points  but iwas willing to overlook it as i think it is worth the watch ,Positive
1294,this movie is very amazing  the special effect and martial arts stunt are very beautiful  this is one the best movie from marvel  a must to see the movie 2 times ,Positive
1295,the best amount of tension and humor  with a great storyline and great characters  loved it ,Positive
1296,besides a few good action parts which do not make to much sense sometimes  the movie plot is thin as rice paper and rolls on too common storyline plots used in hundreds of movies  add to that a few cringy moments and you get a 5/10  not worth more ,Positive
1297,as a marvel fanboy  this movie forms the plot for a big villian entering into mcu from multiverse  the rings are a beacon  and ita calling someone  maybe galactus or doormamu or something big and powerful  more power than thanos!watch it in theatres! all the actors are amazing and i loved awkwafina's role must  must  must watch !!!!,Positive
1298,this films starts off better than expected but then leans on clichés and lazy story writing for the second half the change of the rings to bracelets is not a good one and the guy that wrote the screenplay for wonder woman 2 should not be allowed to work in the industry again  let alone be hired for this film the fight sequences are good   the mistakes made for the iron fist series were not made again  despite this  this is alongside the black widow movie as one of the worst in the mcu  without doubt ,Negative
1299,"rings are literally bracelets  
so why are they called rings?very different than marvel comics
i guess it would make the villain too op awkwafina as the comedy relief & the main girl is interesting i was rooting for them to at least kiss at the end i hope they don't push her back to being just a funny friend in the sequel while having shangchi with new love interest wong cameo just cracks me up  that's probably the funniest part of the movie  a very pleasant feeling to have him included in this film trevor slattery  glad they included him in this movie too tony leung looks too mr  nice guy to be a villain  but a misunderstood villain  which is ok michelle yeoh   how can u not have her in an international martial arts chinese english speaking movie  how awesome!and the whole movie is soooo fantasy  more fantasy than black panther or other marvel movies i guess not having much expectation makes me enjoy it!7 8/10 ",Positive
1300,i'm burned out on the marvel and dc universes  but saw this on a seatmate's screen on a flight and was entranced immediately  omg  asian characters with universal sensibilities and wonderful powers! katy rocks!!! came home and immediately watched it   just ordered the soundtrack and 4k video  oh yeah  did i mention i'm 70 years old?,Positive
1301,it's nice to see the colors inverted  in this movie we can see the red (good) fighting the blue (bad)  the movie can have more potential in it  it's an unpopular oppinion that some of the actor's performance is poor we as marvel fans have been waiting a long time for this  and it's sort of disappointing by my oppinion ,Positive
1302,shang chi has a promising start with stunning locations with a nice martial arts movie feel  the fights were nice  of course we have some good cracks along the way  later on  we get into the main story line and that's where it starts to fall off  the jokes start to make you wonder why they are kind of forced into the picture because some of them are very lame  comedy worked good in thor: ragnarok  i really loved them  but here its just bad  that's all the main problem with the story is that *spoilers alert* shang chi and the villagers could have easily made his father understand about the whole soul eaters thing  that guy seems to have lived more than 1000 years and wouldn't he understand about the whole talking to the mind thing?one last annoying thing is that why the hell they are having two post credits scene as if they were any good  the last one never needed to be in the post credits at all  that's just a normal scene which could have been shown before the credits shang chi would may be entertaining for those who are new to the whole superhero movies  for others  it may seem very formulaic  doing the same thing with different (weak) stories ,Positive
1303,unreal  i've seen them all and this one is by far the best i've seen spectacular action and visuals unlike any other marvel feature film highly recommend if you don't even like superhero movies  this is in another level ,Positive
1304,nice light fun  great side story for the mcu that switches things up from the norm ,Positive
1305,"shang chi was an enjoyable marvel experience with a fresh perspective  but  there are some flaws the action sequences steal the show here no doubt  the fighting styles in the film brought so much freshness to the film  absolutely loved the soundtrack too the fantasy ""pokemon like"" elements is interesting and for the most part  actually felt like it fit with the story  however  it does go a bit too far  while the cgi was good  i think it was definitely overused especially in one particular scene which i won't spoil  simu liu puts in a solid performance and is a likeable hero  awkwafina is fantastic as the comedic relief and its going to be fun to see them in future films overall  a solid 7 5/10 and a worthy addition to the mcu ",Positive
1306,i really lovelovelove kungfu action movies n i reallyreally enjoyed this movie tremendously! i wud love to see shang chi 2 34567 ,Positive
1307,i was blown away by watching this movie in 4k and i really like the vfx and also the locations they chooses for this film  this movie is just amazing ,Positive
1308,loved the movie all the way though  but i am more interested in spider man movie <3 ,Positive
1309,this movie is by no mean nothing more special than a standard marvel movie  but where this story flawed the acting  villain  comedy and visual was amazing  loved this movie and felt like something new  something fresh ,Positive
1310,first off  this is a decent movie sure  there's a buttload of tropey nonsense  small furry disney creatures and all that  but overall it's a good mcu inclusion and simu liu is great  as are most of the other actors the story is pretty decent  although a little over the place in parts  and does a pretty nice job of including it in the overall mcu as well as adding some nice chinese mythical callbacks or whatever you would call them the acting is excellent  especially tony leung who i would say is the most relatable antagonist since marvel's daredevil and the superb kingpin however  there's some pretty bad parts too  awkwafina does well to not be quite as annoying as she's been in other parts  but is given way too much credit and screen time considering she's just shang chi's buddy and has no actual skill or reason to be there  especially with how's she's treated by wong later in the movie  why marvel needs her to be included quite as much i've no idea  especially considering how great shang chi and his sister were in the film lastly  the fight choreography  it is very good  an absolute tribute to the late brad allan and was a joy to watch  especially the close up work and the chinese weaponry which was displayed super well overall  it's well worth a cinema visit  it's a good film and doesn't deserve all the 1 star reviews at all ,Positive
1311,one of the best movies of marvel that i have seen! i never expect it to be this good  the training for this movie is so evident  the movie delivered!!! exceeded my expectations  thanks marvel for this movie! a legend!,Positive
1312,seriously  must watch  cause you gonna see a hole new level story and one of the best marvel movie story    there are something new & big coming with doctor strange   spider is coming in venom doctor strange coming in spiderman    now shang chi also introduced with doctor strange welcome to the circus!!!,Positive
1313,can't wait to see more of this part of the marvel universe  especially awkwafina  her and florence pugh are my new  all time favorite side characters  oh  and hailey steinfeld/kate bishop  excited to see more colorful  bad a$$ women in the mcu!,Positive
1314,"i usually review those movies that i loved and enjoyed watching  this review is a warning  the lead character who was supposed to carry the storyline fades and at last end up being an idiot the gfx and action scenes are cool  the only reason i rated it 7  this movie is way too overrated  if you watch movies like once a months give it a try you may like it  but if you watch movies regularly chances are pretty high you are going to get annoyed and exasperated at the end lacked chemistry  no drama  but had little humour  storyline!!!! please    i wonder if there is a complete script oh   forgot to add   maybe marvel introducing this character could be the reason of being overrated i'm pretty sure maximum viewers of this movie come from the ""dubbed"" community    yeah they get excited too much quickly   ",Positive
1315,this is the first marvel movie that i didn't bother go to the cinema for and i'm glad i didn't waste my money this is just a greatest hits of all the tropes that the mcu has falling into over the last few years to long  i fell asleep twice and had to rewind big cgi battle with no real impact unfunny sidekickmoving to far away from the source material to try a please a wider audiencelack lustre villain it's easily the worst marvel movie and they're clearly running out of ideas and characters maybe it's time to just rest the wider mcu then reboot in a few years ,Positive
1316,i really loved this movie  i'll admit  there's a lot left to be explained (where the rings came from  who the mom is  etc)  but the director and producers definitely got the chemistry  humor  and acting right the movie is just so jam packed with action  even with a complex story line  it had a lot of action (usually complex story lines have a lot of lead in and are slow to warm up  but this definitely was not the case)  and after watching michelle yeong be miss mean mom in law in crazy rich asians  it was so beautiful and wonderful to see her as nurturing auntie and just a complete bad ass with her martial arts (i missed her days of crouching tiger  i'll admit) simu liu was beyond amazing  his chemistry  humor  and not to mention the way he kicked ass on screen  was so damn entertaining  and finally  a movie where aapi are the heroes  what else could i ask for? the cherry on top was awkwafina's blunt ass humor and the way she broke uncomfortable silences with her awkwardness  gotta love it i'd definitely see this movie again  one of the best marvel movies i've seen thus far  i can't wait to see where the story line goes  what's up with the sister  and i mean   with wong being there  dr  strange's future appearance is inevitable  i can't wait!!! such a great cliffhanger ,Positive
1317,shang chi is a breath of fresh air  shang chi truly shows us the beauty of martial arts  i couldn't take my eyes off the screen ,Positive
1318,mythology  martial arts  action  super hero  everything were there  completely a new type of approach from marvel  visually it was a bless  story was good  actors were fine  can't wait for sequels and spin offs ,Positive
1319,"today i watched and find nothing special
nothing new and extraordinary ",Positive
1320,absolute piece of marvel  though story line is predictable it's well scripted with high visual effects  must watch to experience the power of ten rings ,Positive
1321,going into this the trailers had me excited but i was blown away by seeing it in imax opening night  definitely going again later in the week  it really deserves a rewatch ,Positive
1322,i thought that this movie was pretty good  i was very excited going into it  and it seemed like it was going to be a fun time  i was right  the fights were great  it was unique and the cg was really good (for the most part) and almost all the characters felt really well developed  however: i thought the pacing felt way too fast  it seemed like shang chi went from good martial artists to a master of these new abilities he's never learned before  also  the movie couldn't quite decide on the tone  half the time it was funny  and the other half it wanted to be dark  other than that  i thought it was a good movie and it'll be interesting to see where the mcu takes this character  definitely worth a watch ,Positive
1323,yeah it's a super hero film  i liked awkwafina  she was fun  simu liu is also pretty good  i didn't enjoy the end battle but i guess that's included with every one of these movies  i liked that awkwafina was just a friend and not a forced romantic interest  not enough real fights  and too much cgi ,Positive
1324,this movie vfx is very best  this movie story i best and his actions is very immerseive   i suggest to watch all this movie  and not marvel fan he also watch this movie ,Positive
1325,"that was amazing
i thought nothing would take my favorite marvel movie place from avengers infinity war but i was wrong  because shang chi took it!",Positive
1326,i will keep it simple is this a good action movie? yes  if you like classic old asian fighting movies  its perfect  simple story of hero that fight evil  it clishe  it have funny moments  it have some drama and it have good old evil vs bad theme is it good marvel movie? not really  i think most of fans of marvel are too biased and think that china bad  dont watch    plus it dont have much marvel easer eggs   is it good movie overall? its average at best  it have lots of plotholes  lots of clishe moments that not everyone like  lots of chinese styled themes that not everyone like  cgi is not really best  acting is not best for most of time  music is generic as hell  and ending is    not great ,Positive
1327,superb marvel cinematic universe movie of this year  and marvel is back and i love all marvel cinematic universe movies  in future spiderman no way home will come and current shang chi and the legend of the ten rings movie is superb  and in this movie fight scenes are superb  i love this movie so much ,Positive
1328,the best super hero movie of all time  this movie is simply incredible in all parts  music  scenery  direction  plot  even the dialogues are incredible  and being an asian american i felt represented by the film  basically incredible ,Positive
1329,"has few good moments before and after the interval few things i didn't like:1  long forced expositions
1 1 xualin and katey
3  convenience of finding morris
4  bmw car placement straight into the jungle
5  can't they fly over the bamboo jungle maze
6  superfluous acting especially the father ",Positive
1330,"it's a decent movie  happy that the comedic timing in certain scenes isn't overdone and it plays out to be a little more serious  the mandarin in the movie by far the best acted out character and the choreography of the martial arts is on point  the movie is probably about 15 mins too long just when you think ""oh it's finishing up"" there's more  there is a notable difference in the second act with the story going more rapid and pacing is definitely the movies biggest flaw  acting wise it's cool  nothing amazing or something you haven't seen before if you're familiar with marvel it's the exact same model as some of the other movies with it being about family (thor  black widow) wanna have a good time with the family or just a decent watchable movie? this is one that you'll like ",Positive
1331,one of the best mcu movies tbh i really liked the concept and story ,Positive
1332,"definitely one of the top 3 mcu films thus far  right up there with avenegers  and easily the best movie to come out of 2021  it has a quality to it that is hard to explain unless you see it for yourself and even if you are not necessarily a marvel fan or if you are feeling that ""superhero movie fatigue""  this has a more universal appeal that transcends that realm ",Positive
1333,the movie was awesome much better then i expected            action was awesome and the plot was awesome too      acting was quite good highly recomend seeing this ,Positive
1334,me consume all disney product  disney product never stop  me eat every one  i no care or ask just consume  open my mouth insert each product disney make ,Neutral
1335,it is one of the best movies that marvel studios could have made i hope they make the sequel a lot better!,Positive
1336,i give it a 10/10 because the movie was so well made  it may be not one of the best mcu movies  but it sure is a good movie  the acting and the cinematography is so beautiful  i like how much was in chinese  it made it all so realistic  i'm happy kate and shang chi didn't end up together or anything  they are good best friends and there wasn't room for it  the fight scenes are one of the highlights of the movie  wow  blown away ,Positive
1337,okay so i know black widow was good and all but this oh my god this is the marvel magic movie of the year i laughed felt a rush of action and adventure threw out the entire movie it's just flat out fun to watch like every marvel movie should be so much fun so much to enjoy i highly recommend it to almost anyone  so much enjoyment here ,Positive
1338,what an amazing movie  great work  can't wait to see what the future holds for those two characters ,Positive
1339,i don't what to say it is just too good  filled with different types of martial arts and fantasy  with a hilarious katy ,Positive
1340,honestly this movie is really boring  the best part of the movie was the end credit scene  if this is the future of marvel then it's going to badly  even the cgi in this movie looked like it was from 2010  i'm struggling to come up with anything about this movie that actually made it worth watching ,Positive
1341,the movie is very good in all the criteria it picks up  you'll have a great 2 hours journey with this movie  i'll recommend this to anyone who asks me! i have put my rating for different parameters of the movie guide for understanding the parameters: 0 = not even one bit present  1 = very little  2 = little  3 = not to much & not to little  4 = much  5 = very much positive messages: 4  positive roles: 4  violence & action: 4  adult content: 0  bad language: 3  consumerism: 2  drinking  drugs: 0 overall: outstanding!!hope this review helped you :),Positive
1342,i was hopeful for this movie  being that it had no ties to any other marvel characters  it had potential to become something unique  i was not given what i wanted  the main character felt like robots for the plot  they almost never have any emotions  the whole movie feels like your average marvel action movie  just a little less interesting ,Positive
1343,i thought i'd like the film  but i didn't expect it to be one of my all time favorite mcu movies! it's a mix of crouching tiger  hidden dragon and anything jackie chan  the action in this movie is as good as you've read  and easily the best action in any mcu film to date  simu liu is awesome  but the ending is so epic it's definitely worth the price of admission  as an english teacher i loved the self aware reference to macbeth  but the film does a fantastic job completing the hero's journey  great job marvel  you've done it yet again ,Positive
1344,just seen it and i have to say it not up to marvels usual standard it really feels that disney are making this film to tick boxes it's got a confusing plot and a frantic pace you feel tired just watching it my verdict is could do better ,Negative
1345,why are asians saying bro in this movie and a girl calling someone bro is a real turn off to the movie  asians are trying too hard to be americans  makes embarrassed to even be half chinese ,Negative
1346,"i wanted to enjoy this  but by god  it was awful it was just weak  unrelatable nonsense  i didn't care about any of the characters yes there was action etc but   
the tone was all wrong  it was played too much for laughs the liverpudlian guy seems like he gatecrashed from the film in the neighbouring studio; awkwafina's acting was just disappointingly bad and awkward  and the final battle scene was so so busy that i couldn't tell what was going on  at all it felt like it would never end a joke of a film ",Negative
1347,the simple  well choreographed fights were far better than any cgi battle mess which unfortunately took over the movie in the 3rd act  decent characters and mediocre at best lore make this a forgettable entry into the mcu ,Positive
1348,"this movie has great kung fu  wonderful story  good acting besides the usual special effects  i enjoyed this movie more than ""black widow""  the action would be home in any of the classic kung fu movies i hope the shang chi and the ten rings returns soon ",Positive
1349,just a mess  starts good but soon gets in fairy tale land  has the usual stop to have a heart to heart in the middle of a battle  more a poor take on lord of the rings for chinese viewers  no offense meant  if it had just been a better movie  slow middle and poor ending  the trailer is far better than the movie  don't waste you time  life is short  something that this film isn't ,Positive
1350,this should be not less than 8 5i am very impressed ,Positive
1351,the action scenes were on par with the crouching tiger hidden dragon and other awesome awesome kung fu movies that that came before  there was bruce bruce lee and jackie chan is jackie chan elements to elements to the fight scenes the comedy was not over the top or too much or forced into areas to break up the heavy drama  like the cape in dr  strange whipping away the tear hoodnmobie  better than i expected ,Positive
1352,after watching the mcu finally grow up some with the eternals (gloriously long and rewarding) i was suddenly very saddened to see that kevin feig would allow backsliding like this all action  meaningless bit of fluff to be released at nearly the same time can't please everyone i suppose  the great reviews this awful popcorn flick gets are impossible to understand even by the lowest mcu bar  was it some inadvised attempt at multiculturalism? leave great asian filmmaking to the masters who come from there if you are able to discern anything as being worth even a couple hours of your time or not as opposed to automated mcu franchise consumption  leave this one aside ,Positive
1353,shang chi was a great surprise! didn't expect to enjoy it as much as i did  it is ranked high up amongst other marvel's great blockbusters! only had good things to say about this film  great visuals  beautiful landscapes  action packed scenes as well as the martial arts were the best ever captured on the big screen  the film felt authentic to the chinese culture and the cast were perfect  the predominantly asian & asian american cast shows an important step forward towards cultural representation in these big budget blockbuster films  and it's nice to not only see asian characters presented with none of the all too common stereotypes  it was also great to see moments that allowed for strong women to have their time to shine without it feeling forced   the comedic moments and timing were spot on and added even more flavour to this great film a great start to phase 4  look forward to seeing these new characters and stories furthered in future marvel movies ,Positive
1354,this is a good movie i'm not denying that    there's amazing cgi  good music and a very promising premise  for the first half the movie does great  but the second half seems very weak  the characters start making whimsical decisions and the story starts feeling very rushed  i really wish they could have kept it together though  the movie was slower than most marvel movies and i was liking that fact too ,Positive
1355,i had read the advance reviews and was excited about the positivity and glowing feedback i'd seen  it means a lot to asian americans to finally be put in the spotlight  and by a juggernaut like the marvel machine no less went to see a late night showing on thursday  sept 2nd  technically a day in advance of the official release date  happy to say the movie did not disappoint  i've watched so many hong kong style movies over the years and the shang chi film making team did a spectacular job of importing that authentic  asian flavor of film making  they did the kind of research i've come to expect from marvel's creative team  and let this team leave their own distinct chinese style from using mandarin speaking dialogue in strategic moments  to the very distinct style of chinese influenced music (totally awesome!)  and the kung fu sequences on the scaffolding  which is something you see in many of the old school kung fu movies  michelle yeoh  in particular  acted in many a movie in this vein back many years ago the filmmakers did a great job of melding old style  authentic chinese kung fu cinema and themes (father son tension  motherly devotion  male prioritized over female  etc  ) with current asian american themes (underachieving children and over expecting parents  general confusion in american society) and combining everything in the context of a fantasy action movie with trademark marvel humor to lighten things up i was a fan of the special effects throughout the movie  and thoroughly enjoyed the ending sequence as well  like other reviewers  i loved the opening fight sequence between tony leung and fala chen  it's wonderful to see that tai chi   style of fighting introduced in a western  blockbuster movie crouching tiger  hidden dragon was a great movie but with shang chi  i think marvel achieved something more in melding disparate parts and taking on much more in bringing together cultures  generations and viewpoints in the context of a mcu superhero action movie  the next time we see shang chi  there's no doubt most of us   moviegoers of all colors and cultures   we will be happy to see him again ,Positive
1356,well  that's me done with marvel films  this was truly awful  terrible cgi  terrible script  terrible story  ben kingsley was the worst  i genuinely hoped they would all die at the end  and i thought black widow was bad ,Negative
1357,the fight scenes  creature designs and set are absolutely amazing  but overall story was sort of slow  visually stunning but yet i couldn't help but feel it's a bit overrated  it also felt less connected to the mcu than most marvel films and the first wong/ abomination cameo felt very out of place ,Positive
1358,i did not enjoy this film at all  badly written characters  expositional mess  terrible humor  cliched scenarios  this movie felt like a huge tokenism for asian people  it should have been named awkwafina and the legend of shang chi ,Negative
1359,if i could i'd give it a 7 4 then i would! it had the right amount of comedy mixed with action and a decent storyline  the plot was a little bit predicable  but not overly cliche ,Positive
1360,movie never left me hanging  liked all of it  good story and if there is a next one i can't wait ,Positive
1361,from start to finish this movie delivers  the acting is great  the writing is marvel (you like it or you don't  i do)  the action is brilliant  scenery  story  cgi: top notch if this is what p4 has in store for us  yes please!,Positive
1362,i came to theater with high expectation because people rated this movie so high     but why?i just saw this movie and i swear to god  i have never seen anything awful like this movie in several years  the storyline was so terrible nothing special  no any plot twist and no emotional moment but stupid joke  why they bring an old story line in any chinese fitting movie and also include this too? so lame next  i don't know is this hollywood movie or bollywood or a korean tv series? you will see what happens in the first 15m the cgi was unbelievable fake  especially bus fight scene  then the last fight scene so suck made me to leave the theater im an also an asian but i cannot accept this  they just want to slavery china and earning money  such a waste of time any money also risky while quarantines the brightest things happened was music pretty well  with the weekend  but only it  don't waste any time on this or you just a m fan boys ,Negative
1363,"this felt lightweight as far as mcu movies go it was like watching an episode of the current kung fu"" tv series (olivia liang)   but with a bigger budget that olivia liang ""kung fu"" tv series is excellent by the way   great script  acting  and fight scenes one expects a movie like ""shang chi"" to be much  much better  otherwise  what's the point of going to the movies?",Positive
1364,frankly  terrible movie  forced jokes  the storyline was weak  the antagonist who was hundred years old was even weaker  i could go on and on if they thought that including acrobatics in the action scenes was going to make this movie better  well  let me tell you i've seen lots better in low budget martial arts films a waste of time and money  a movie marvel that doesn't feel marvel  yes i regret investing time and money to watch this movie  marvel can i have my money back?,Negative
1365,this is by far the best choreographed mcu film to this point but that by far doesn't mean that this is the best mcu film  also wenwu is by far one of the best mcu villains of all time because of how much character development he had throughout the film the train sequence and the battle ring arena are by far some of the best fight scenes in the entire mcu alongside this abomination's long awaited return in this film that really helped bring the battle ring arena sequence to life  alongside this razor fist really makes every action scene he's in feel threatening due to his unique appearance and abilities the only reason why this film only gets a 9/10 in this film is because of how ridiculous the final battle in this film was as it really didn't fit within the film and really felt a lot more like a final showdown in godzilla monster battle compared to an mcu film  if they had just used wenwu as the main antagonist for the final battle it would definitely have a 10/10 form me ,Positive
1366,great movie  very good pace overall and great balance between chinese style movie  marvel cinematic and contemporary characters and humour  after seeing the trailer  i wasn't in a hurry to watch it but after watching  it has definitely changed my opinion overall loved it!,Positive
1367,i finally took the plunge and went to cinema for the first time since 2019  the movie was highly entertaining with engaging characters and a good story too  the action and fights scenes seemed very well choreographed and the special effects were a joy to experience on the big screen it was a marvel film that didn't feel like a marvel film  which shows how versatile the mcu is becoming i was highly impressed to see and hear characters speak in their native language  a risk as many people don't like to read subtitles  but being an avid fan of asian cinema i was quite happy and comfortable to do so overall  a highly entertaining and fun film from marvel i highly recommend it  a+++,Positive
1368,"the worst marvel movie by far every thing was awful every thing
katy character and her line doesn't make any sense she shoots an arrow with practicing just one night
she's a normal girl and yet she sings the song when she's about to be killed really??the funniest part is the enemie of shang father know that he doesn't wear the rings and they come and killed his wife and they didn't know that he can wear the rings again really????totally a waste of time ",Negative
1369,the main story is totally not well built like mulan  pure disney shxt  i rate this 7 only for the acting brought by tony leung and seeing bruce in the first post credit scene ,Positive
1370,good movie  i expected no less from a marvel movie  i recommend it to everyone who likes action movies with a good story we are introduced to a character who has not yet appeared in the films and narrative arcs are created with this new film in addition to the many references throughout the film  it doesn't let the viewer get discouraged with the dialogues ,Positive
1371,a must watch for mcu fans and fans of martial arts movies ,Neutral
1372,this was a fun  thrilling  funny  emotional ride  from the acting to the cinematography to the effects  i can't commend the creators enough  this may be my most favorite of all the mcu movies so far and is an awesome beginning to phase 4 ,Positive
1373,i watched this today not expecting much  but how wrong i was  loved the action  loved the visuals  you could tell ben kingsley was having a blast  everything about this movie was perfect ,Positive
1374,i was going in with not much fate in this movie  but i got proven wrong  its something quite fresh and unexpected  some scenes in the first 45 minutes are a bit weak and could be preformed better  the last hour or so is the absolute best  (they could've gone into more details of the rings themselves and they might want to rethink the cast next time) the music on the other hand was okay it was the final battle where the music stood out  the cameos are crazy! i have to give full points to the hair and makeup department and the costume designs  the costumes where awesome! the movie doesn't try hard to be the best   and it doesn't need to because its already pretty good by itself!marvel did it again!,Positive
1375,was super excited going to see shang chi and i wasn't disappointed  the shang chi childhood back story scenes were amazing&very well done  the action/ fighting scene were also do well   a overall good movie straight out of the mcu playbook  when it works it works&more than not it always works for the mcu   please start taking notes dceu  and a epic post scene cameo by captain marvel and bruce banner  ,Positive
1376,was hopeful the story with a predominantly asian cast would have succeeded as well as black panther did in the marvel realm for a non white dominated cast  but this was such a disappointment  and what a lost opportunity! the cast was literally the only redeeming thing about the movie  otherwise the script and cg effects were so bad that i just lost interest in the movie and stopped paying attention  it seemed like probably 95% of the movie was filmed in front of a green screen and someone did some really fast cheap animations to fill in the rest  after watching a movie like dune (2021)  where you never once get distracted by poor special effects  i know what is possible and i just can't escape into a cartoon world anymore  even the costumes were cheap  like they could only afford two rolls of fabric and were supposed to believe that everyone coordinated their outfits and wore brand new clothes all on the same day? and awkwafina's character was pointless throughout the entire movie  so they gave her a purpose at the very end that made no sense at all for her character  the interest in quality was not priority for this movie at all  and really strays from the marvel films' reputation unfortunately  such a bummer ,Negative
1377,"i feel all the high reviews are paid    
the story has so many loopholes  shang's chi father has a chopper  he can use them to reach the village  why wait for the path to open ",Positive
1378,"this movie had my attention from the very beginning with the action  storyline  ""comedy""  and awesome realistic graphics  disney did a really good job casting simu and the other actors  definitely a must see movie!",Positive
1379,what a pleasant surprise  i went to see this movie with absolutely no expectations  i was surprised at how good it was!stunning cinematography  spectacular visual effects great storytelling  funny dialogues amazing choreography for the fights you root for the characters and feel their emotional journey it isn't a movie that stays with you  haunting you  but it's an enjoyable watch!,Positive
1380,one of the best origin films in the mcu  and one of the best marvel films overall  10/10 recommend ,Positive
1381,it's seems after avengers  marvel has nothing more to show us  everything about this movie is boring and horrible  it tries to be another doctor strange but it failes  bad comedy  bad acting  bad story    ,Negative
1382,best marvel movie in the recent times! great action and just enough humour rather than the usual marvel ott  strong character development makes them relatable and connected  nice pace with beautiful fight scenes  impressive overall!,Positive
1383,marvel and its magic    just watch the moving picture and watch till you jaw drops  ,Positive
1384,i was amazed by this one !!the soundtracks  the visuals !!loved everything in the movie every moment was so entertaining   i really enjoyed it ,Positive
1385,the movie was so pointless    the plots doesn't make any sense at all  overall bad cgi  bad jokes hijack the only meaningful scene from the story that ruins the scene completely  the whole movie was like it was made for 5 year olds  everything just happens with zero logic at all  i know people love the mcu but praising this kind of childish movies it just lowers the overall future marvel movie standards ,Negative
1386,i was not expecting to enjoy this movie as much as i did  i'm a sucker for a good martial arts movie and for traditional oriental music but we saw what happened the last time marvel tried to do martial arts    (iron fist)this movie is without question in my top 5 marvel movies! the action is incredibly choreographed and there is not an overabundance of it  the score is beautiful and i have found myself listening to it regularly since i saw this film  character development is top notch  all of these things needed to make a great movie is wrapped into a nice package sprinkled with that marvel charm we have come to love over the years  i can't stress how much you need to see this movie ,Positive
1387,so recommended i enjoyed this movie a lot  stunning cgi and cinematography  and i liked the cast and the story welcome to the circus shang chi :),Positive
1388,went to cinemas after year and half  totaly worth it macau fight scene stole the movie ,Positive
1389,i really liked this movie  the story was good  so were the fights and effects  also  how can you not love simu liu? i love him from kim's convenience but he blew me away in this  canada proud! <3 ,Positive
1390,"horrible movie
waste of time  money  every thing
if you like to watch something fantasy that really haven't valuable thing to offer  that's your type of film ",Negative
1391,i had no preconceived ideas of what this movie would be but i was very surprised and delighted  it's probably one of the better standalone movies from the marvel verse  i definitely enjoyed it more than ant man ,Positive
1392,it's one of the best marvel/origin movies to date  can't wait for what's next  it was action packed  hilarious  and emotional  family at its heart/core  the story was epic  visuals were great  it redeemed iron man 3 and ten rings  wenwu was amazing  one of the best and memorable marvel villains  simu liu shined as shang chi  it was made for him  his portrayal made shang chi an instant fan favorite  co stars were also amazing  they portrayed their roles perfectly  especially  xialing and katy  such great characters  a must watch ,Positive
1393,i went into this movie with a real open mind and i have to say that i was kind of disappointed  for me  the acting felt below par and the story felt very slow moving and didn't really go anywhere  i loved the fight scenes though  it was really cool to see pure hand to hand combat and martial arts be the centre of a mcu film  overall i was not very pleased walking out of the cinema  i didn't feel attached to much of the characters either and there was no pace to the movie ,Positive
1394,"this movie is fabulous  
writings for every character was brilliant  action sequences were beyon my imagination  worth watching   phrase 4 begins with a blast ",Positive
1395,from the story  the development of it  the choreography  the comic treats at the right time    it's just different from all the mcu which makes it refreshing for the fans  so many disciplines involved  the action and what it makes you feel while watching is what makes me want to dedicate a little of my precious time to watch a movie  this one is the movie of my 2021 ,Positive
1396,you may (or may not) find shang chi to be a fun movie to see in theaters  the film is full of tropes  from the narration over an origin story  to an inner city urban flip on an distinctly asian character  to the cgi we're to assume is real (that never quite does translate as real)  this well intentioned film about discovering who you are doesn't seem to know for sure what it is  for example  there is tie in to the larger marvel universe  but almost out of corporate necessity to set up subsequent movies versus narrative need to set up a deeper story inside itself  there's also more profanity than other films  often used as a momentary gag that doesn't advance the plot  even the final sequences land in dark places that confuse the family storyline versus clarify it  if you're looking for a fun night out  perhaps you and your crew might enjoy this film    or you might crave something more significant ,Positive
1397,it had the potential to be one of the best marvel movies i've seen with its music  great action sequences and cinematography  but they wasted it  there are so many silly jokes and no scene made me laugh except for the ones in fake mandarin  let's come to the character of kathy    the acting of the woman is bad  the character is unnecessary  if it wasn't in the movie  nothing would have changed  it is also absurd that someone who has probably never seen an arrow in her life can become an arrow master in one day  the scene where shang chi's parents fought was not a fight but a dance  it was really bad  that's it  movie isn't a bad movie but it could better ,Negative
1398,"having seen the trailer for the 2021 marvel action movie ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" i must admit that of course i was going to watch it  but i feared it would just be another run of the mill over the top cgi fest but barred of proper contents marvel movie  yet  i opted to sit down and watch it  on the notion that it was a marvel movie  but also because of the cast that starred in it ",Positive
1399,"i mainly checked out shang chi due to the hype surrounding the movie  with all the rave reviews coming out i felt like i was going to see another blockbuster like avengers end game  boy was i wrong  the movie had some pretty visuals and some ok dancing type action sequences  but that gets a little old halfway through the movie  the lead actor and the villain have the charisma of a ""wooden plank "" i found myself trying to stay awake and make sense of the non sensical plot  and big battle in the forest near the end with the dragons that come out of nowhere  bottom line  i'd say this would be a perfect free on demand movie you can catch at home  or maybe redbox ",Positive
1400,shang chi was amazing!!!! one of my top favorite marvel movies! i cannot wait to see this again (and again)!!!the fighting was beyond superb  the depth of acting was heartfelt and was the living embodiment of the movie  simply the best marvel origin story to date  well done!,Positive
1401,for a guy like me  that grown up watching jackie chan's kung fu movies  this film was a wonderful experience!besides all the perfect fight scenes and amazing special effects the story telling was terrific  i was completely moved by shang chi's story and his family's and the ending was awesome as well! i don't have too much to say  just a wonderful feeling that this movie gave me!,Positive
1402,sure it is over the top at times  it's a cartoony fantasy movie and a well made one at that!not a huge fan of the last end credits scene (why does there always have to be a set up for a new conflict)  but it is what it is ,Positive
1403,good work  lots of money was given to the right people to create the right movie  from choreography  to story  to cinematography  nothing disappointed  top 5 marvel movie for me hands down ,Positive
1404,watching this move was like watching a clown act in a circus ,Neutral
1405,one of best solo hero films from marvel  good action last 30 minutes are bang on  martial arts action in whole film  nice story  emotional combo  binds you in the story  nice cast  acting  bang on  sound tracks are good  vfx are good  post credit scenes are good ,Positive
1406,this was a great movie  i really enjoyed it from start to finish ,Positive
1407,marvel tries to show only greatness of china  and half of the movie doesn't have any action very boaring movie  total waste of time  no comparison with dr strange movie and ironman movie  this is (minus) 10 star movie ,Negative
1408,i went to the cinema to watch this movie in imax 3d and the money was definitely worth it  honestly this is my favourite stand alone film in the mcu  the visual effects are outstanding  as well as the fight scenes and some good comedy though :))  i recommend everyone (not just marvel fans) to watch this movie ,Positive
1409,"i'm no marvel fan but this film didn't meet my (very poor) expectations i thought that it was boring through out with fight scenes of pure cgi helping me get through it  the end fight scene was standard meeting for marvel but everything else was disappointing  again marvel never produces phenomenal films but with this the acting and comedy (more so the comedy) was so boring and mundane nothing got a giggle out of me apart from my friend making fun of the film it's self  with this i believe that shang chi could have been better  fight scenes were ok and nothing impressive just ""theme park cinema""",Positive
1410,this one is for sure top 3 marvel movie's to action packed  no time to be bored attitude definitely worth to watch it amazing fx and good storywaiting for more come on disney part 2 next christmas ,Positive
1411,i actually enjoyed this movie  i thought it was very good  it was very action packed and the tension too was there  the acting was also very good   i would be very happy if they make a sequel ,Positive
1412,wow  i came into this film with mediocre expectations and i was absolutely blown away  one of the top 5 films of the mcu  great themes  well written leads  good chemistry between characters  top notch vfx effects  and the fight scenes were stunning! they were giving winter soldier hand to hand combat + modern martial arts w/ a twist  everyone needs to watch this film!,Positive
1413,"this movie doesn't really know what it is supposed to be  a drama? a fantasy flick? a superhero movie? a bromance? a comedy? it tries way too hard to appeal to every possible viewer  that is why it achieves nothing  it started well with some really awesome martial arts scenes  but then the story got more and more confusing  there were more holes in the plot than in swiss cheese  for instance  a 14 year old trained assassin apparently got bullied at school   really?? and why was this guy who played a british actor even in the plot? the moment he showed up was the moment i was done with that movie  and then there were the over the top magical creatures who probably were supposed to get some ""awwws"" from the female audience  but the most disappointing thing to me was  that the more interesting and more badass sister got treated the way women typically get treated in hollywood: she got totally ignored  why did the male hero get all the rings? she did deserve at least half of them  it's male storytelling at its finest  as usual ",Positive
1414,i have to say it  hollywood is pretty honest in this movie and tells it as it is: as a woman  you can be badass and tough and strong   but you will always play the second fiddle  it's outraging  although the plot was a mess and this movie was all over the place   this was the true message that came across  the mother and the sister were the strongest characters  yet the mother had to give up her powers when she married this horrible man and the daughter   despite being overlooked all her life mustered up the strength and motivation to become a great fighter  although she was way stronger than her brother  she ended up with nothing  while her brother is now the master of the rings  a real slap in the face of every woman and every girl who is going to watch this movie  oh  and have i mentioned the awful plot?,Positive
1415,all movies have flaws  but i really liked this movie and its very enjoyable  there is a lot more chinese dialogue that i thought there would be  which is amazing to me as a big budget hollywood film  but some of the translations were a bit off simu liu is very talented and likeable  the legendary hong kong superstar tony leung plays wen wu (aka the mandrin but he said it was made up by others)  and meng'er zhang is amazing  even though xia ling was her first movie role  the action is one of the best things about this movie  especially the hand to hand combat ,Positive
1416,been playing darksouls game series and really nice to see dragons and souls creatures  the cinematography  environments are pretty awesome and beautiful  kind of felt different than marvel style movies like dark vibe ,Positive
1417,been playing darksouls game series and really nice seeing dragons and souls creatures  the cinematography  environments are pretty awesome and beautiful  wish for dc like this; moving forward and new characters ,Positive
1418,the film has action in it  but its not only about fighting  there are bad characters  who are indeed not entirely evil  there are good characters  who are not without mistakes and weaknesses  besides i loved the storyline  the characters  the acting  and loved the music  i do not give a damn about the colour of the actors skin in any of the films  it is an awesome film  thats all ,Positive
1419,i just simply love how beautiful this movie is! the actions  the visual  everything!,Positive
1420,an absolut entertainment  funny  emotional  action packed  acting is good direction editing very very good  other techniqualities are good    al last a powerful origin story ,Positive
1421,this is the most visually stunning film in the marvel universe  it features the most impressive physical fight scenes yet in the cannon  but most of all the plotline and script are faultless   a perfectly balanced epic journey  the performances are pitch perfect  it's a chic  fantastical juggernaut  with exquisite heart  i'm going to return to it time and time again  simply because of how enjoyable and entertaining it is  i cannot wait for the next shang chi film! wow!! love this story!! fantastic! i hope they re release this in theatres when the second film comes out because it would be phenomenal on the big screen ,Positive
1422,"let me start off by saying i enjoyed the film a lot  however i feel like katy's character (i don't remember what exactly her character's name was) is almost unnecessary  i understand her whole thing is comic relief  but i personally didn't find it funny  it's almost like they're trying to appeal to one specific demographic with her character (which i understand and i'm just not the target audience)  but everytime she makes a joke it's like i'm supposed to just wait for it to be done so the story can continue  if her character was completely removed from the movie  nothing would change and that's the biggest problem  she doesn't add anything  and when you have to watch a movie with a character he adds nothings but time to a movie  it gets a little annoying  also  the arrow? there's no reason she should've been able to make that shot  i don't care if i have to ""suspend disbelief""  it makes no sense ",Positive
1423,"liked:
the action and fight choreography are very  very well made  and was as able to follow the actions clearly  honestly  all the fight scenes are very well made and reminded me very much of jackie chan's movie  such as in rush hour 2 a scaffolding fight happened in this movie  this is most likely because supervising stunt coordinator  brad allan (which the movie dedicated to) was a member of the jackie chan stunt team  the train fight scene may be one of the best of the mcu  in fact  a similar fight happened in captain marvel but it couldn't top this disliked:
katy doesn't have a good backstory  the fact that she just hangs around with her best friend  travelling around macao then wen wu's fortress and to ta lo  later in third act was then be able to shoot an arrow right on the dweller's throat  the writers could've simply mention her archery or something related to her backstory so that her skills would make more sense the cgi final battle between the great protector and the dweller was way over the top and obscured by thick grey fog  couldn't follow the scenes much ",Positive
1424,this has done excellent work and it's vfx is aswome in last battle scene vfx is so much realistic and it's main actor is from china is also acts good ,Positive
1425,this movie was phenomenal  we cant expect more from a solo superhero mcu film  everything was perfect  all the scenes were great  the graphic works were so eye catching!! the dialogues specially the joke parts were great  in this movie they portrayed the family drama in a fantastic way  the action scenes are eye touching too  also some parts were emotional when we almost cried    if any of you who have not still watched the movie and reading this comment my first suggestion will be please don't miss the mid credit scene  your mind will gonna blow up!!!,Positive
1426,this movie served as an introduction to a brand new character and a whole new world as we learned about all sorts of magical places  i felt a connection to the characters all the way through and really loved the new places and concepts  really excited to see more of this character and place ,Positive
1427,my expectations for this movie was low  maybe it's due to the fact that there wasn't much hype around it but men it delivered awesomely ,Positive
1428,didn't know what to expect from this movie  but it didn't disappoint  it caught my eye  and when you catch a viewers eye  it means the movie did something right ,Positive
1429,this was an amazing movie with good action and magic  i loved the idea of the ten rings being there since the beginning and more lore behind it  most importantly     trevor slattery ,Positive
1430,"compared to other action/kung fu movies  i think there's more impressive than those fights but even then; it still works  they well introduced martial arts and 10 rings and i'm impressed of how they use it in fights but i kinda want to see the unique powers of each rings (based in the comics)  still  it's entertaining  visually stunning and it's out of the mcu's pattern which is great  however  i'm not convinced of the mandarin's motives  it kinda lacks evilness ( ""she"" is his weakness and that's why he's been easily manipulated by a beast and that kinda sucks)  everyone's scared of the mandarin but in this movie they gave him too much of a heart  in spite of that  it is still a great movie  i enjoyed it recommended to everyone ",Positive
1431,go an watch this movie in theaters   the story effects action  comedy acting everything are awesome  ps : and you will get 2 post credit scenes ,Positive
1432,a visual treat to relish!1  the vfx was  of course  brilliantly executed and the details were so very intricate 2  the cast! they absolutely stole it 3  the story was beautifully written with a perfect pace and placement of scenes 4  the absolute winner for this movie was the soundtrack  the music fit the narrative extremely well and i as an audience was totally soaked into it  also  mcu's new style of patently crafted melody for each scene depending upon the narrative mood was an absolute delight to watch 5  completely  worth every penny a 10/10 for you shang chi!,Positive
1433,loved it all  the comedy  the story  the acting  the special effects  a new character of marvel with a lot of potencial  hope to see a lot more of this in next movies ,Positive
1434,nice start for asian power in mainstream us  very first superhero  the movie has really nice cinematography and choreography  the fight scenes were excellent  director really knows how to create a suspense  already marvel standard now  the problem with this movie is that everybody important is good person  there is no bad person in this movie  so there's not enough conflict  at the end  they have to come up with a dragon out of nowhere to be the big boss which doesn't quite make sense  by the way  liang chaowei is really fashionable and young looking in this movie  great for people in his 60s  liu simu delivered a good performance ,Positive
1435,this movie blew me away with the effects and how beautiful it is   the fight scenes were so greatly choreographed and the tracking cinematography was just perfect and made the scenes flow so well   the backgrounds were just perfect and very aesthetic   the chemistry between the characters was just perfect and the jokes were funny  its so good to see a platonic relationship between a man and a woman   it is definitely worth a watch at the cinema ,Positive
1436,i thought this was one of the best storylines that marvel has come up with in a ong time   it was good to see that they focused on and martial arts within the film ,Positive
1437,i think the best way to describe this movie is the matrix meets kung fu pandathis is a great movie! the action sequences are spectacular and even though there is lot going on in them  unlike some other epic battle scenes in movies where you lose track of what's happening  these are filmed in such a way that it's really easy to follow and make out what's going  the cinematography is spot on with plenty of slow motion which is just as well because the speed these guys move is phenomenal and breath taking at times  bruce lee would approve the acting is good all round and the characters a good and relatable to  over all it's a visually spectacular experience and all fans of marvel or martial arts will enjoy it ,Positive
1438,simu is very professional with his acting and i was pleaded to see a friend get his chance i worked with him year's ago good job  very surprised it was very good ,Positive
1439,after a long time finally marvel a very masterpiece of of mcu     but i have only one issue that is no introduction of ten rings in movie what is ten rings   power of ten rings noy a single hint was there   but this is the one of the best marvel movie ,Positive
1440,as someone who loves the marvel brand and is skeptical about its future regarding political messaging  this was a pleasant surprise  if the new phase 4 marvel movies are of the same quality i'll be very delighted to sit back and watch what else marvel brings to the table for viewers ,Positive
1441,this is a awesome movie  the fights and story are awesome and i really liked the soundtrack  too much jokes but still awesome  the fights were one of the best things in the movie and the cgi was too  i really liked simu liu in this movie  my favorite part was the fight at the end it was just awesome  this was my 5th favorite marvel movie i think ,Positive
1442,i honestly had no expectations watching this movie because i've never heard of shang chi in any of the marvel comics definitely surprisingly fun to watch  action packed! definitely recommended!,Positive
1443,this movie is rated way too high for what it's worth  it's all too predictable in a negative way  too boring characters  too boring story  too little action and too bad! everyone should watch the movie for themselves but don't fully believe in the high reviews!,Negative
1444,the story wasn't too bad  i didn't understand his sidekick  she was annoying and kind of ruined the movie for me  i didn't see the need to have her in there  the fighting was subpar  totally predictable especially people with weapons  you could tell when the swing was gonna happen and where it was gonna be placed  they need better choreography ,Negative
1445,we just finished watching eternals and we had to re watch shang chi to recover  if i could rate this 11/10  i would  there are not words to describe how good this movie is  simu liu is a breath of fresh air in the mcu  casting was fantastic and they all complemented each other beautifully  all the humor hit home  action sequences were brilliant  this is a home run all the way ,Positive
1446,"as for the plot  it seemed to me that when creating it  such paintings as ""black panther"" and ""spider man"" were taken as a basis    it feels like the creators thought: ""so  we shot ""thor"" about white  we shot ""black panther"" about black  let's now shoot about asians    and add a funny partner there like a fat man in spider man?""  that's how the script for the film ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" (2021) was born by the way  the script seemed to me somehow unfinished  it feels like they could think over more thoroughly and capitally  but apparently  the deadlines were tight and it turned out the way it turned out    therefore  the final battle looked as absurd and ridiculous as possible    and so  the film could well claim the success of such masterpieces as ""iron man"" (2008)  ""thor: ragnarok"" (2017) and ""guardians of the galaxy"" (2014) nevertheless  there are a lot of fun and dynamic moments in the film  there are also very touching and dramatic moments available  if the script were a little more elaborated  i could even let a stingy man's tear   in general  despite all the disadvantages  i give the film a well deserved 5 out of 5 i recommend watching it by 85% if you're still thinking about going to the cinema or not  feel free to go  the film is not boring  dynamic  cheerful and touching  there is a conflict between fathers and children again ))so  i'm very glad i watched this movie  which reminded me a little of such a dc picture as shazam (2019)  which i also recommended for viewing in general  if you have watched all the above marvel and dc movies  you will definitely like this picture as well  very beautiful and bright graphics with oriental flavor ",Positive
1447,a slow movie with snarky comedy  scenes are slow by being full of dialog  watchers may be confused about what is going on in this plot because of slow dialog ,Negative
1448,this movie is fantastic! it is full of action and you also get the see the return of the mandrin   the real and the fake one  i highly recommend this to mcu fans   it has mythical creatures and even the abomination ,Positive
1449,i really enjoyed watching the shang chi origin come into place  in my opinion the storyline was presented amazingly and the backstory is interesting  the ending with the rings and shang chi getting introduced to the avengers left the audience with questions that will soon be answered  very exciting  overall it's an amazing film  graphics  cast  chemistry and much more  very recommended by me  not the biggest review but i don't want to spoil the movie too much ,Positive
1450,this movie was an utter mess  i was excited that a kung fu super hero was taking the stage but had little hope it was going to be good  the backstory is garbage  not only is it stupidly cheesy it was unbelievable  the style couldn't make up its mind  things clashed to often and seemed half hazardly assembled  the sisters character was so unbelievable i came to wish she wasn't in it at all  though i thought she was one of the better actresses  akwafina is so over used these days  it's like we have to use her for any disney movie that has an asian actress in it now  and she's not a very good actress     tony leung   how can you mess up a movie with tony in it? somehow this movie managed to take everything about kung fu and make it boring  especially the finely post credit scene  terrible  this should have been my favorite marvel movie and it is sadly my least favorite ,Negative
1451,it was fun  beautiful  and different  very watchable and rewatchable which is an important quality in action movies  go see it while it's in the theater because it is a pretty set film best seen on the big screen ,Positive
1452,this movie felt more disney than marvel  i enjoyed it but felt the cgi and second part of the movie let it down  the fight scenes in the first half of the film were excellent and then it got silly in the second part  maybe worth waiting for it to appear on disney + or dvd ,Positive
1453,this abomination from disney and marvel takes the worst of both worlds and marries them for the home box office  the over the top disney scenes and songs are reminiscent of tangled and cars  mix this with the cavelcade of senseless  plot less action sequences marvel is known for and you get a half baked movie that leaves you frustrated with every new scene ,Negative
1454,this film breaks the marvel mold with its action and fantasy aspects  you can't prepare for what you'll see on screen  just fantastic in every way ,Positive
1455,if you are a fan of the character  you will love it  marvel is opening up to new realms and its going to be intense    next up eternals let's go!!!,Positive
1456,this marvel movie was the most disappointed movie i ever seen ,Negative
1457,"it's a story about love  have courage to respond to your calling  and letting go  great acting and the whole package of the whole movie is awesomely done  though i don't think the marketing of the film is good  for almost zero campaign regarding this film is seen prior it debute  another thing worth mention is chinese people just won't fight or even threaten to ""kill"" his/her parent  not to mention to even fight in front of parent's tomb  marvel could have avoid the fighting thing in the shrine  since chinese culture just won't allow anything disrespectful the ancestors at all the story line of wenwu(tony leung)  his character and his love towards his son and daughter is obvious  and leung did a great job acting as a chinese stubborn strict father who's afraid his legacy will be lost and desperately want to build an empire to conquer all  he loved his son and let his son do whatever he wanted for ten years  and though he had it all  wenwu realized he can never get over his wife and he wanted to see her so badly  he became delusional and knowing it's not possible but still wanted to break the gate in talo the story of why webwu is like this is solid  but shangchi wise  is not  the movie would be better if shangchi showed a bit of affection towards wenwu and his sister  also  in ancient chinese society  women often has to learn to play music  sewing  or painting and play chess  shangchi's sister could have done other stuff  rather than peeping aside and not being able to learn anything in her childhood  since wenwu supposed to love her as well  in regards of wenwu's power and money  it shouldn't be hard to find his offsprings proper tutor cgi wise is intriguing  you will see some characters from ancient chinese shan hai jing  it pretty much like jurassic park in marvel universe btw  we need more tony leung in hollywood ",Positive
1458,after a promising and colorful opening in a magical forest  the movies meanders  it is like a lesser disney movie  but with a few good fight scenes  the fight on the bus is maybe the best  the lead actor is good  but he is given little to do; same for akwafina  so many scenes in the first half are shot in low lighting  for no good reason  everything else is meh or plain silly ,Positive
1459,"another lame attempt from disney own marvel to cash in on an old school marvel character  completely ruined another character that has a 40+ year history  story base on little to no facts and showed little abilities of the character  if you cant get the story right just come up was a totally new character i'm so glad i got out of comics back in 2003 disney is doing nothing but ruining the history of everything they touch  i should have stayed at home and watched the netflix movie ""kate"" and saved my money  even ""jolt"" had more action spoiler jolt and kate were better movies ",Positive
1460,without a doubt the best action sequences in a marvel film and the best action scenes too  one of the best marvel films also  a great story and great acting  loved this film sequel please!,Positive
1461,"my preconception of this film was ""meh"" as i didn't feel it would be a significant entry to the mcu canon  luckily my 17 year old son really wanted to see it so when i suggested an impromptu trip to the cinema that was the film ""we"" chose it's tempting to make comparisons to ""black panther"" as i felt the representation of chinese people and culture was similar to the african representation in bp but it stands alone in its own right and there are some great call backs to phase 1 which i won't spoil  mcu fans you won't be disappointed ",Positive
1462,"as a marvel hater i want to say this films is awesome  is not the terrible ""joke every 5 minutes""  i loved it  all the action and history is interesting ",Positive
1463,the acting was good  the story was easy to follow  the visuals were amazing! the fight scenes were really fun to watch  highly recommend this is a great action movie to add to your collection  i hope to see simu liu in more movies awkwafina was great  as usual  love her!,Positive
1464,so beautiful  i just loved it  the acting is great  the story line is good  the villain makes sense and has depth  i'm all for it  probably the best marvel movie so far in my opinion up there with guardians of the galaxy  the humour even made sense  the scenes outside the sisters fight club were shot so well and the foo dogs were just glorious to see ,Positive
1465,"to clear out the reviews fight  i believe that the situation is like this:if you love martial arts you will love this film  if you are chinese you will probably like it  and even more if you live outside china if you are a huge marvell fan you will like this movie or at least tolerate it all the rest will probably be disappointed it is still a marvell film  and the quality is good  the story is less good  and at many points loses any common sense even for a ""superheroes"" movies that initially lack any sense  marvell could do better at least with the story ",Positive
1466,this is a really good uptake on a marvel movie  its definitely not like other movies in the mcu  the different cultural aspect makes it a fresh approach and the action scenes are stunning  the story is marvelously portrayed  its a simple story but the direction is amazing and the screenwriting and the vfx team  they did a great job  i loved this movie ,Positive
1467,one of the best action movies till date one advice to dc fans: stay away from giving negative rating out of jealousy  if you hate marvel so much then stick to your dc comics and movies  avoid giving false reviews and ratings to marvel movies it's not gonna bring marvel down ,Negative
1468,it's a cool chill movie it's not overdramatic and it has fights throughout the entire movie  not just the end what i loved the most were the visual effects the dragons looked epic and the dragon battle was really cool the movie also had some fun comedy in it it's an entertaining movie with great visual effects don't expect a unique storyline ,Positive
1469,first part of film was ok  but got bored when all the mumbo jumbo started  watched eternals last week  that went the same way  got up to wash the dishes half way through if i have to watch a superhero film  give me avengers and guardians every time ,Positive
1470,i really wasn't expecting this to be so good but it was  and more so  just when you thought that end game had wrapped everything up you can see yourself getting sucked in all over again ,Positive
1471,dragons are real  just see this movie  dragons  are  real ,Positive
1472,no real feeling for the characters  some weird ways the movie attempted to make me care but i didn't when a certain character dies i was disappointed as i thought they could've had a better arc ,Negative
1473,so so boring movie didn't expect this from marvel    so much annoying movie ,Negative
1474,flat storyline  over the top picturing of the creatures  doesn't feel anything or looks anything attached to marvel movies at all apart from the loveable wong  feels like watching movies made by china production companies that made that matt damon the great wall movie  disappointed!,Positive
1475,finally after much procrastination  i've decided to give this movie a watch  that is after disney+ had added it to their listings all i can say is  i was glad i didn't fork out money to watch it in the theatres  period  it's just another disney movie where you walk out of the theatre and ask your kids what they have learnt from it  and for adults  you could generally pick out very generic learning points easily i was very surprised that eternals received more criticism than this movie ,Positive
1476,i watched this movie because people praised the action scenes but seriously  you have to be a complete martial art movie noob to be impressed by this stuff  most of the scenes are obviously fake and full of cgi  the fun thing about martial art stuff is to watch actual athletes doing crazy stuff  you see with this movie that the main character isn't a skilled martial artist to begin with and it becomes embarrassingly obivious with the fight scene with michelle yeoh  who is an actual talented fighter  they had to cut multiple times and add cgi magic to make him look good  they lost me completely when they started to go crazy on cartoon fantasy and cheap chinese lore  it's a dull and generic movie for people who have watched a lot of asian movies  i give 4 because at least it's not woke ,Positive
1477,this movie has been much anticipated  but in my opinion it fell short marvel to me is absolute gold (along with the dark knight saga) this movie lacked humor (apart from mr slattery)  cgi was way over the top and wire fighting was too obvious  as a kung fu movie  this failed ,Positive
1478,"mcu now is in a very strange phase when the universe they've built now is so huge that their movies almost completely stopped working as standalone pieces (aside for a few exceptions like thor 3) shang chi brings asian aesthetics to the table which is kinda new for the universe  and it's done quite well  they've managed to present a whole new world inside the one we've already had at this point throughout this one short movie  they've packed it with alright characters  adventures and action  so as a piece of the bigger narrative this movie is quite well made but to me it falls short as a standalone picture  it feels so formulaic at this point that it hurts sometimes  all the twists are obvious from miles ahead  the threat of ""the end of the world"" is so regular at this point that it's impossible to be invested in it and the stakes don't feel significant at all and i hate the fact that even a well made movie like this one leaves you feeling empty after watching  it doesn't bring a feeling of completion which i think is one of the most important parts of cinema  even wong tells something along these lines in the end: ""it was only a beginning  now you have a very long journey ahead of you"" i'm for one kinda tired of this never ending journey  and almost want to stop watching anything new from the mcu  so that i don't feel this never ending cliffhanger moment ever again light 7/10 to this movie  big donkey ass/10 to the mcu ",Positive
1479,so tired of this creature appearing in plot lines by now  felt there is nothing original in the story  very predictable story  not very strong performances from most actors  the lead was great but the rest of the cast felt lackluster ,Positive
1480,"i found this story to be incredibly moving and i absolutely loved the story  my partner and i spent the entire ride home comparing notes and gushing about the acting  anyone who says ""the acting is ok"" is using that bs to support their overall dislike for the film *or* they've recently changed their meds  i was surprised at how well awkwafina's character fit into it all  she was an anchor for the main character to the life he ran away to  she had purpose   especially in the end they all had great character development and i loved the story  the antagonist killed it and he just layers upon layers  the main characters acting was outstanding i cried through a lot of this film  at several points i asked myself why the hell i was crying so much (wait    did i recently change meds?!)  maybe it's the family loss that hit home  they brought in other characters from the mcu and it was nice seeing so many other movies threaded into this i'm surprised at anything less than 7 stars  this film was great entertainment and i'll be first in line for the sequel ",Positive
1481,it just missed the mark  it was certainly watchable   entertaining and enjoyable but for marvel something wasn't right  could have done more with wong & abomination   it was just a little too predictable and a certain character was almost jar jar binks like but just saved in the end  hopefully another in the future but with some more depth of character ,Positive
1482,shang chi has the best combat action sequences if compared to any of the previous marvel films story was great visuals and cgi are awesome  watching it in 3d feels like i am entering in another world all characters are perfectly played by the actors ,Positive
1483,"review of ""shang chi and the legend of the 10 rings""  the newest from marvel and what a sensational one ! technical fight scenes  strong martial arts/kung fu  lots of humor  elegant moves and original language  our main hero and heroine are chinese  so we can expect some traditional karaoke scenes and perhaps a dragon or two  based on one of the marvel comics  let's leave it to that  there's no need to compare the book with the film  just enjoy both the story itself is a classic love story  the things we do for love  but as always we have the battle between good or bad and the grey area in between  whoever owns the 10 rings will be the master of his fate  invincible and troubled at the same time  power comes with responsibility this must be the 12th time for me to fall in love with tony leung  all over again  such a charismatic actor (from the film ""in the mood for love"") as always intense and charming  his intriguing smile is a trigger to be more careful  it's an exclusive quality  is he serious or are you the next victim? no doubt  he's always in control of every character he plays  here  he's the badass  xu wenwu  with a big lust for power and he has the 10 rings to help him achieve this never ending hunger for more  but there's more to him than just being strong headed and bold  when he meets his opponent  a female force so overwhelming   it awakens tenderness and modesty in our villain  that's how you win  use the yin yang  it works every time  there's more to life than just battle and gaining power  victory has many shades and combined with love  life becomes paradise  however  this is a huge action movie  so brace yourself for lots of twists in the storyline  with surprising animals and hidden secrets in some people's hearts  they are all fighting an inner battle  holding grudges and making the same mistakes every time  why are they hurting inside? we have to look at the ghosts from the past   because ""you can't outrun who you really are''  and that's the centre of all the action  our hero chang/shaun has a troubled journey ahead  becoming himself  restoring his given powers  reconciling the past with the present in order to obtain the balance of the world  and that's exactly what marvel does best !! with beautiful fight scenes  all fully orchestrated with calculated blows and kicks  such graceful  exquisite and delicate moves  like a perfect dance  and who else than michelle yeoh  our martial arts diva (from ""crouching tiger  hidden dragon '') who has elevated her profession to an allround level  it's such a pleasure to watch her in fight scenes  she has an elegant and experienced style  new star on the horizon is the other fighter xia ling  she has the badass attitude  it comes natural to her  she delivered great action the women fighters are equally blessed with skills (usually in chinese historical drama)  with the exception of awkwafina (plays shaun's pengyou/friend)  she has other know how and she's good at it  so no need to compare  if you put all efforts together  there might be a chance to defeat the enemy tony leung has such an important character here  his acting is quite impressive and in a pleasant way he takes the limelight from our hero  who seems okay with it  not sure it's because of the storyline  or his status  or even his image on the poster  he's literally the boss there  that's probably the power of the 10 rings  whoever wears them will rule the world  but beware of jealous competition and deceit in the name of love  even in the marvel universe rings are magical  centred around great powers and endless possibilities  they are worth living or dying for  all in all  a very interesting and action packed movie  very entertaining  very smashing/thrashing and a very good one for a date night  or see it with your friends/family  enjoy the ride ! must see !!",Positive
1484,the movie is nice  with everything  the graphics and effects  the story is not so great i was expecting a lot from this move  but i was left unsatisfied ,Positive
1485,sure it was an entertaining average marvel installment  but  to me  nothing more  it's not very grounded(even for marvel)  they quickly move away from the very good fight choreography and in my opinion they don't do the mandarin justice  marvel is in a rut story wise  they haven't hit a home run since endgame  i hope they're going to step up their game ,Positive
1486,i really liked the actors they casted for this movie but i felt they did not focus enough on developing the characters rather than just throwing a bunch of cgi at you  the cgi was some of the best i've seen don't get me wrong  but it heavily shadowed the most important part of any movie: the plot  more time needed to be put into that aspect and the amazing marvel cgi will follow  seems to be a trend with some marvel movies  just making it really boring when you go deeper than surface level ,Positive
1487,this movie was amazing  one of marvel's best  i love when marvel makes an action packed movie  yet contains an important message about family and overcoming grief  i'm not sure if this is the best for children  as the ending  and the incessant sight of death may be a little much for young fans  additionally  the editing and cinematography are by far the best i've ever seen in a marvel film ,Positive
1488,i admit the script was pretty cheesy and basic but everything else was quite brilliant & beautiful  this is coming from a marvel fan  the action and scenery made the movie  not sure how awkwafina was invited to join team in the end  she doesn't have any skills or does she?,Positive
1489,from the beginning i was fooled believing it would be a cliche origin story but completely shattered my expectations by the end  this movie is extremely fun and will leave you stunned by the end  the choreography of the fighting was flawless and give no disappointing action scenes  there aren't any groundbreaking performances especially by the lead  this doesn't take anything away from the film though and i am confident he will improve and become more comfortable  don't leave during the credits!absolutely needs to be seen in theaters! great movie ,Positive
1490,went to the theater for michelle yeoh and tony leung  but wowed by simu liu  a rising martial art star with different outlook  awkwafina is funny  pleasantly surprised to see ronny chieng!love the visual and music  like the plot  and will wait for a sequel not walking away with a lot of deep thoughts etc  but enjoyed the movie ,Positive
1491,the vibe of the film is just so nice and i don't know why  action scenes were great especially the martial arts  good villain  you understand why he does those bad things  there is also humor in the film but it always stops at the right moment  so yeah it's a lot better than black widow ,Positive
1492,this movie is not for everyone i would like to preface this by saying that i was really thrilled to have an asian superhero on the big screen  the trailers looked fantastic and i was hoping marvel/disney could supplement the visuals and fight choreographies with a good storyline well set into the preexisting mcu unfortunately  i was a bit disappointed the visuals are stunning as expected  the fight scenes are great too  but the story is a mixed bag it starts off as a family drama between shang chi  his father and his sister  that would all be good and indeed it was  i really enjoyed the first half or so of the movie  even despite the main villain (or supposedly the main one at that point in the story) being a bit bland in my opinion  certainly for a 1000 year old conqueror and mastermind wielding incredibly powerful artifacts of unknown origin (sidenote: the rings turn out to not do much beside being hurled at enemies like projectiles with cool light effects; in other words their powers are really not explored or represented well at all) the second half (when they discover the mystical village) is when things go absolutely bonkers  if the story kept revolving around the family of the protagonist  it would be all good  but for whatever reason someone decided to throw a complete oddball into the movie in a form of soul eating demons (?) which  without much explanation or backstory (the only thing we know about them is that they exist)  instantly assume the role of the main bad against whom everyone (including the previous main villain and his henchmen) must fight  at this point i was just sitting there amazed by the visuals and absolutely confused by what was actually happening as i wasn't sure if the main fight was shang chi against his dad  shang chi against the soul eating demon  the great protector dragon against the demon  shang chi  his sister and his friend katy against the demon   you get the point the camoes of other mcu characters also felt forced  wong was fighting abomination  sure  but why? we never find out and it's hinted that they are actually pals  does that mean secretary ross just occasionally misplaces abomination for friendly sparring with a sorcerer then? captain marvel and bruce banner also appear  briefly examining the rings which apparently have some kind of a beacon in them  again  completely out of nowhere but perhaps a promise for the next movie where we might actually find our what the hell is going on with these things (which again seem only as a collection of cool deadly mini frisbees in the movie) am i glad that i went to watch it in a cinema? yes  do i think the character has a lot of potential for the future movies? absolutely  but as of right now  shang chi has been one of the most underwhelming introductions of a new superhero within the mcu to date ,Positive
1493,i would give 9/10 for it if they were fully speaking chinese   i am eastern european   can we stop making every movie in english and just use foreign language where it can work   i don't wanna watch naci speaking english   or russians speaking english   it takes the beauty of cinema ,Negative
1494,this film contains everything you hope for in a marvel movie  acting  direction  cinematography  music everything has perfectly blended in this film  martial arts action sequences with magical mythical creatures and comedic sequences and family sentiments  it is a complete package  it has created a new look to marvel from other movies  and it is one of the best marvel movies  definitely marvel phase 4 movies are gonna be lit  and this movie has done a great job in introducing it ,Positive
1495,i dont enjoy marvel movies anymore but this plot was enjoyable since it wasnt as predictable ,Positive
1496,the guy that played gandi  now deminished to a mearly clown  i thought these marvel movies where supposed to be for teenagers and young adults  but i realize that it's just for little kids    it's all too forced the empty story   ,Negative
1497,"in terms of history  i think it has the essence of each marvel movie that is to leave with more questions than answers  of course  of course they are the origin of the rings   the awesome post credits scenes leave the window open to a possible sequel as well  from the character's entrance to ""the avengers"" i think this movie shows that the mcu is being renewed in this new phase and that it brings us many surprises  the scene where abomination and wong appear are incredible! the special effects are crazy  each marvel movie is improving in terms of visual effects ",Positive
1498,i love shangchi becasue the story is good also the fighting  very recommended to watch   🙂👍,Positive
1499,all movies mixed and made   a king with one super ring that controls nine rings given to nine kings: lord of the ringsa king loves a tribal princess; of the two offsprings  one flees away from home and buildsa fort on her own wish: frozen 2trained thoroughly in martial arts in a building on a hill: kung fu pandaall dragons carrying fish and feeding the alpha lying in a dungeon of a hill adjacent to water: how to train your dragon ,Positive
1500,i really wanted to love this  and it had some great elements  especially in the front half of the movie  some excellent characters with great interactions and genuine laugh out loud moments but eventually it morphed into a predictable and very underwhelming story  i was really hoping for a clever twist or unexpected plot element but was letdown and came away a bit disappointed looooots of various martial art styled fight scenes  so if you like that you'll love the movie ,Positive
1501,i enjoyed watching it   didnt expect that but i really liked it   and the fighting scenes were awesome   great movie   lots of martial arts which i love so im giving 10/10 ,Positive
1502,it was my first movie in theaters after endgame and i should say it was a bang  it has the best balance in fun and as well as adventures  its the best start of a new phase  i loved it i saw it on 8ts 1st day of screening and i can properly say it that marvel was the only one expected by us to take us to theaters and they proof it by this movie  its a must watch in theaters thanks ,Positive
1503,great origins story welcoming into the mcu  this movie is a hit!shang chi has an awesome blend of story telling  action and adventure and brilliant visual effects  characters are very likable and this movie will make you laugh and make you feel just the right amount do yourself a favor and don't listen to the bad reviews  just go see it ,Positive
1504,i convinced my friend to go see this tonight based on the high score and positive reviews  but the movie turned out to be a real let down extremely predictable  no suprises whatsoever  the jokes never really landed for me and most the characters invovlved were there soly for comic relief  hocus pocus jackie chan martial arts scenes that has no anchoring in reality main antagonists motives were very unclear  did he simply go mad after 1000 years of sanity? and main character learned how to use the rings better than his father after 10 seconds  what the actual? very unlikable side characters introduced  what were the studio thinking going into this?very obvvious that they cramed in the monster fight at the end just to have visual spectable  disney animals everywhere  this is without a doubt the most goofy marvel movie as of yet visual team did a great job though with the cgi  therefore 4/10 ,Positive
1505,appreciate the character played by tony leung chiu wai of xu wenwu  his acting  charm and charisma was so brilliant that even though he was the villain  he empowered it with his acting skills the movie has exceptional choreographed action choreography that we have not witnessed since captain america: winter soldier  great sequences of martial craftsmanship ,Positive
1506,"great balance of action and story line  well acted by the cast too  i hope this character will fit in well with the marvel movies  jokes were nicely timed
and not over done  recommend watching ",Positive
1507,tony leung i will no longer be a minor in a few months :),Positive
1508,"this was my initial first thoughts before entering the cinemas  ""am i going to enjoy it? will it be filled with cgi crap?"" well yes  but no  it was so beautifully done  that it made me saw wow at the end  this is something that you would wanna see in the theaters  it was so beautiful i even got posters for free of the movie to remind me of it  it's a movie you don't want to miss  seriously!",Positive
1509,despite my high expectations  this movie was still better than i thought it would be  the post credit scene blew my mind and the cgi effects are top notch  woul recommend everyone to watch it❗❗❗,Positive
1510,clearly only people working for the film have rated it high   trust me don't wast your time or money  its 2hrs ill never get back   acting was terrible  only decent thing about the film was the special effects    ,Negative
1511,1st off people expect too much these days and dont know how to have a good time  this marvel movie just beat avengers to me  just saying i loved the bus fight!,Positive
1512,best action and sci fi movie ever  pliz go and watch this movie  it's one of the finest movie of marvel  marvel do good job ,Positive
1513,u don't think people are ready to watch chinese tradtional fight from marvel also main story was weak otherwise plot was expected and boried also i was very excited to see new marvel movie put its looks like they are goinf done and the glory time is done another dissapointed after black wideo ,Positive
1514,not the best but not the worst marvel movie  somewhat forgettable  but still enjoyable  the humor helped ,Neutral
1515,i went into this hoping for fresh ideas but with low expectations and boy was i surprised  this film was amazing! the casting  script  acting and everything else in between  marvel really smashed this ,Positive
1516,the movie's cgi and action sequences were top tier  but the story and writing  the most important parts of a film  were predictable and simplistic character motives were shallow and stereotypical and i was not emotionally invested in the family or any individual character  once you understand that the movie is about family  which you can pick up right away  the plot  conflicts  and resolution are entirely predictable the movie had its classic marvel funny moments (diffusing tense moments with surprising humor)  but i cringed in plenty of scenes too  this movie had a poor ending with little emotional catharsis  the ultimate conflict was resolved with cgi  magic  and deus ex machinas  like the average action blockbuster  which might have been acceptable if it had emotional depth or moral complexity  but it didn't overall  the movie was a typical superhero film about family bonds with kung fu and dragons  as much as i love the chinese representation  as i am chinese  the movie itself was disappointing ,Positive
1517,the movie provides an excellent experience for the whole family  one of the best  if not the best  origin stories in the mcu  amazing cameos and mind blowing action  this one is for any die hard marvel lover or action seeker  the actors produced some of the best on screen performances we have ever seen in an mcu movie  keep up the excellent work exciting times head for the super hero movie lovers ,Positive
1518,i think shanchi was perfect for the film and he deserves a great score  i saw the film and it was wonderful  i suggest you to see that there are excellent and perfect actors in the film ,Positive
1519,what can i say  marvel + mythology is almost always good  and the fight choreo is perfection  good characters  well paced  with good sets and a great premise ,Positive
1520,"tbh i m not really into the marvel's  but this one looked really good and fresh  so i had high expectations but was also ready to be disappointed as  well  it's a marvel but  omg  it was way better than i imagined !real and very well choregraphed fight scenes where not everything blows up  badass women who are not shown as inferior and  thank god  are not sexualised  dilema ""the bad guy is a bad guy ?""  good humour (thank you awkwafina !)  respect of the asian culture (at least not huge mistake and direct disrespect but i m not an expert) and good ending where the spectator is satisfied but it still let the possibily to other stories so  yeah  great movie !",Positive
1521,if you want cgi and epic fight scenes this movie is for you but if want anything else you will be disappointed ,Negative
1522,very great choreography  every fight tells a great story and the movie grabs your attention and doesn't let go  only reason that this isn't 5 stars is that the final act did what black panther did  became too superheroy and got distracted by cgi battles rather than getting into a great family battle between father and son  still other than that the movie was fantastic and more people need to go see and support this film!,Positive
1523,the fight scenes were passable but the plot was incoherent nonsense  the dialogue was hammy and clichéd throughout  the whole thing was a naked  cynical cash grab pandering to the chinese market and nothing more than that ,Negative
1524,this is making the future of the mcu look even greater than it is ,Positive
1525,watch this in theaters! it was a great storyline with well developed characters  the entire cast was fantastic and it had moments of humor and seriousness seamlessly blended in! loved seeing an asian superhero who rocked it!! he was brilliant ,Positive
1526,this movie supplied everything needed to be a great movie  beautiful culture  great storyline  incredible choreography  and straight up bad ass fight scenes  overall great movie  and must watch  finally a well written movie comes out!,Positive
1527,wow  what a stunningly beautiful movie  incredible fight scenes  beautiful cinematography  amazing story and villain  loved every minute of it  marvel has done it again!,Positive
1528,to be honest i wasn't much interested to watch this movie even as a marvel fan  but my friends forced me to watch it and now i am guilty    what was i thinking to be not interested in such a masterpiece?? even the 1 star reviewers liked this movie they just dont want to admit it ( in my opinion)  my advice for the poeple who are going to watch it is please make sure that the first time you watch this movie should be in theatres its just a whole different experience ,Positive
1529,shades of crouching tiger hidden dragon in the fight scenes  beautiful cinematography!but c'mon aquafina is cringy! please no more  i was hoping she would get sucked up by the soil sucker demons   ,Positive
1530,this movie is really good and not quit as expected  as a marvel fan  i was afraid it would end up like black widow  but it was way better  there is a good upgrade in marvel villains compared to other solo movies  it has the marvel solo hero movie formula with marvel regular comedy which was a good hit in some points and disastrous in others  the background music is fantastic  a mix between modern and classic chinese melodies  the acting was between ok and very good  the worst thing about this movie is the cgi especially at the last third of the movie  the world they established was wonderful but i feel like some details about some characters were vague especially regarding the mom  at the end  it is a good marvel solo movie and a quit upgrade regarding other marvel solo movies ,Positive
1531,"love everything the visuals nature  action  acting everything on point
best superhero movie of the year he'll yes
new fav avenger shang chi ",Positive
1532,a refreshing return to theatre going normalcy! the movie feels different from the previous marvel movies and while i had low to no expectations from this movie  i was iron man'ed into falling in love with this movie and the character that ai formerly knew little about  the action was awesome the visuals both practical and cg were awesome and the story wasn't over complicated or too simple  saw it with friends and we enjoyed it start to finish  simu liu and awkwafina have great chemistry and tony leung chiu wai is very relatable and relatable as a villain and person  over all i love the movie the most for feeling both down to earth and human while also being full marvel wonder  like iron man  the way it opens a wide and beautiful future for marvel leaves me optimistic and excited ,Positive
1533,amazing personality  amazing personality  amazing personality  character is not very funny  i love the character  i love marvel and the heroes  thanks marvel ,Positive
1534,this new marvel movie is so outstanding post credit scene is mind blowing  i am shocked  i waiting next part of shangchi movie no spoilers anyone request go and watch inthis new movie marvel universe ,Positive
1535,good cg that's all  as a chinese  i dislike this moive not beacuse any stupid political or racial reason just because the film script is too old fashioned  too boring too illogical ,Negative
1536,a tough film to watch  struggled to keep my attention throughout the entirety of the film  the marvel movie formula did not translate this movie well no amount of cgi effects could save this movie from the dull plot with any luck this movie will not have any continuing role in the marvel franchise worst marvel movie so far? i think so ,Negative
1537,awesome movie    to be honest one of the best marvel solo films everrr    ,Positive
1538,good in certain moments  and those moments were very few ,Positive
1539,i watched the movie in real 3d  the 3d part was wonderful  but that's where the wonder ends  the storyline was  well there was no storyline  there was no depth to the characters  2 hours into the movie i was hoping that it would just be over already  very disappointing movie ,Positive
1540,mcu aside  this movie stands alone as an epic masterpiece on its own! the fight scenes were visually stunning  great acting  great story highly reccomend!,Positive
1541,"its was great  finally after so long we got to experience good origins story  i know kevin feige will nailed it even after lot of people thought its gonna flop the movie is like a mixture between western and eastern culture afterall the protagonist is an asian living in american the raw choreography is the best in the mcu  better than winter soldier  the cgi fights is not bad but i think they should do more of the raw realistic fight scene more because its the most appealing part of the movie tony leung is so charismatic even if he is a villain  i can feel sympathetic to his character  the new mythology is cool  the fantastic beast is awesome too
i hope we can see a sequels ",Positive
1542,the cinematography in thsi film is absolutely amazing   filled with beautiful landscapes and animals  the dragon fight seen was beautifully done and idk how the average rating isn't higher to be honest the film was amazing ,Positive
1543,the marvel studios once again makes a movie that uses jokes instead of making a good character development ,Positive
1544,overall it was a pretty bland movie  the plot was uninteresting and boring  there's not as many fight scenes as you'd think  most of the characters didn't have a lot of personality  and shang's girlfriend was incredibly annoying it had it's moments though  there's a certain character that brought some fun scenes to the film it's definitely one of the lower tier marvel movies  but it was still worth watching ,Positive
1545,"shang chi will likely be heralded as the ""chinese black panther "" but in truth  this is the film black panther wants to be when it grows up  easily top 5 in the mcu  and probably competes with guardians of the galaxy for my favorite of the bunch there are several nods to the wider universe  and if you're a die hard fan  they'll be quite rewarding  but they never distract from this mostly self contained story this movie is at times seriously  laugh out loud funny  but it never falls into the trap of allowing humor to undermine its emotional moments  ben kingsley and awkwafina give particularly standout performances  and if the latter's  shall we say  overt comedic style can get grating for you  know that not only does she deliver it in small doses  but she also has some surprisingly heartfelt moments  too perhaps the most spectacular feature of this movie is its stuntwork  there are multiple incredibly long  exceedingly well choreogrphed fight scenes  there are some which are the most creative  crazy  acrobatic fights since jackie chan's glory days in hong kong cinema  others take clear inspiration from the dance like wirework of wuxia films like crouching tiger  hidden dragon  even borrowing one of its lead actors for one of them  throughout  the camerawork is clear  without the rapid fire cutting that pervades much of hollywood  the cinematography at times takes wide angles to really showcase  rather than mask  its stunt performers  at other times  the cameraman is treated as another performer  right in the heart of the acrobatic choreography while the the practical stunts will get lots of attention  the visual effects are just as beautiful  taking full advantage of the blockbuster budget  there are elemental effects that prove that a live action avatar: the last airbender movie could work  there are creatures that range from cute  cuddly animals to monsters that would make kaiju films jealous  this movie even pulls off the difficult trick of making energy based sci fi weapons seem raw and visceral in the center of all this spectacle is a surprisingly resonant personal story about a broken family  tony leung gives an incredible performance  making a millenia old  super powered warlord not just sympathetic  but even relatable  the titular character embodies one of the film's central themes of bringing together aspects of disparate influences to forge a unique identity  the other lead has a similar story  but hers is arguably even more compelling all in all  shang chi is a film that does just about everything right  and it does so while bringing its own fresh take  not just to the mcu  but to hollywood filmmaking in general  they really knocked it out of the park with this one ",Positive
1546,the action definitely carried this movie  the fight scenes are great  but the writing is a bit weak and the final fight (between the monsters) was kind of boring  overall it's good fun and the best piece of marvel entertainment since endgame ,Positive
1547,bad acting  boring story and incredibly cheesy  i didn't bother watching it all  the random woman that's in it throughout is purely irritating  honestly don't waste your time and don't trust its 7 star rating  i'd rather watch banana man  complete rubish ,Negative
1548,"this movie is so goddamn frustrating  sometimes it's great and then it just goes down the predictable hole and then it just gets worse and worse just wow the acting was meh for the most part  nothing crazy  gets the job done but wow tony leung knocked it out of the park  i didn't know him before and as soon as i saw him i felt something different and sure enough i was right  he was the best part of the film without a doubt  great villain  10/10 probably the second best villain in the mcu right after thanos  if not just as good  then (minor spoilers ahead) the film decided to throw him out and go for cgi monsters  the cgi in this film is good when showing small cool looking magic effects but the fight scenes and stuff were so bad  i remember seeing this smoke near the end near shang chi that was so bad it felt like it came out of a b grade indian film that used a free vfx pack  disappointingly bad cgi  the final villain was disappointing  i just can not feel for a villain that can't even talk let alone have a good past  it's just a monster that wants to kill everyone  could've just watched godzilla and had more fun  this film could've been special  but no it just makes itself much worse than it needs to  the protagonist sucks  i did not like him (or the villain was so good that i could care less about the protagonist)  his sister was sort of cool but they could've done her better and actually made her cool  she's just the ""female empowerment"" character  a forced character with forced scenes and don't get me started on the comedic friend  she's horrible  ruined the film for me even more  her jokes are bad  her voice is annoying and she gets together with the hero in the end  wow what a surprise! if they made the film just about the father i'd have given it a 10 because it was that good  sometimes it feels like 2 different people wrote this  one wrote the father's part and the other wrote the main storyline  the humor is 5/10  hits sometimes and sometimes i cringed  just no  ben kingsley's parts were a joy to watch  even as a comedic character here he commands the scene  he's just too good the soundtrack was also frustrating  the score itself was pretty damn good  it's clear that when given the tools that the composer is used to  they will make something great but wow were the electronic themes bad  some fight scenes had edm scores and they were horrible  and the songs just wow  they were horrible  they just don't hit the same  mixed poorly (not that strong sub basses) and just overall not as cool as quentin tarantino's or even martin scorsese's ones the fight scenes are also like the film  frustrating  cgi parts are horrible and some shots had such weird lighting that it was hard to focus because the light behind was like a neon light/from a board and had weird colors and like the shots just weren't good enough  the fighting that was done by the mother was pretty cool and the fighting with the masked guy was pretty cool too  the one which happened in the building  the choreography was nice the girlfriend becoming an archer was expected and it just destroyed me  it was so bad  she's supposed to be no good at life and then now she's a master archer? they trained for what  2 days at best and shang chi is a master at martial arts or something?i'm just complaining about this film this much because the villain was just ruined by this film  he was just too good and this film did not do him justice  i hate this film but can't truly hate it because of the villain ",Positive
1549,really nice concept with great direction  teams work & vfx  i really enjoy the movie 🤗,Positive
1550,the film was good but the final fight dragged on and the build up to the fight was too long and i got bored of the martial arts like an hour in ,Positive
1551,generic super hero story  fails to connect emotionally with the audience  i have seen a 6 minutes short anime film named 'shelter' and it could connect with me in such a short time  however this 2hrs long movie failed to get me emotionally connected to any of the charecters  just some good looking mindless action sequences  expected more:(,Negative
1552,just odd movie  clunky acting  lazy story telling  it deep ended so hard towards the end  yes i know its a super hero movie  but soul sucking godzilla sized dragons? friend who has never shot a bow trained enough to be the only than manages to interrupt giant soul sucking dragon with one arrow? guy with 1000's of years of experience with the rings  defeated in short order by guy who has never used them? and then proceeds to know exactly how to use them? to kill giant soul sucking dragon weird movie really was ,Negative
1553,i was blown away with this movie! it reminds you of an old jackie chan movie yet still being modern enough to bring in a new audience  the acting is great  the special effects are amazing and the fight scenes     omg they are the best fight scenes i have ever scene in a movie!! and the soundtrack to go along with it is just perfect all and all this is a great addition to the mcu and i'm excited to see where they go with shang chi next in the mcu ,Positive
1554,    and that's at least the minimum you'd want from this type of action film  and that bus scene  whhooo! i also loved the mixture of languages in some scenes (i don't have a problem with subtitles)  all of the leads are well cast  as are several supporting characters  and the script is pretty tight ,Positive
1555,great action and aventure movie  easily one of the best mcu movies and that is a lot to say ,Positive
1556,shang chi and the legend of ten rings i good can help marvel's 4th phase to get better ,Positive
1557,the fight scenes would be better if they were more grounded in reality  instead of the dragon thing  you have a character who's been introduced for the first time  and you shouldn't add bunch of other elements to it 7*s for andy le <3 ,Positive
1558,"""simu liu"" really brings everything to life and embodies shang chi to complete perfection  almost as if he was born for this role  to a point where he will become marvel fans new favorite  and in my opinion  is on par with the casting likes of ""roberts downey jr"" (bold statement i know)  but along side ""simu liu"" actress ""awkwafina"" will also steal the hearts of many fans  bringing many smiles and laughs to viewers faces and becoming something so much more then just a side character  fans will route to see her more and more in the future future the actions scenes are nothing but bliss to see  perfectly choreographed fights that really capture the style and heart of martial arts  the special effects are beautiful to the eye and in the last two acts will simply blow you away and introduce you to a new world to see and new life to capture you and completely immerse you into the world of shang chi as for the story  shang chi carries alot of weight and heart  that will provide many laughs with its humor but will also pluck the strings of every ones heart  with out saying to much  shang chis story is something of a symphony with its story telling  what could of ended up being a basic story  end up being a deep  thrieving with life  story with plenty of meaning  with a broken family at its heart  each character has their story  taking their different paths back to be whole again  some fans my leave with a tear or two as a whole  marvel manages to yet again  provide us an amazing cast to embody its iconoc comic characters and bring everything and every one to life on screen  shang chi  is a consistent adventure from start to finish and provides nothing but pure mcu entertainment at its finest  and will leave fans begging for more of shang chi ",Positive
1559,i wasn't expecting much when i first heard about it  but the storyline is one of a kind and i definitely enjoyed the fight scenes ,Positive
1560,just watched the movie and i am speechless  the fight scenes were absolutely perfect and made my jaw drop  the character's were perfect and the little bit of comedy that was added made the movie even more amazing  if i could watch this movie again for the first time i would because the experience was out of this world ,Positive
1561,brought to you by the truth tellers film is great overall and in this genre at least  is one of the best all year round that has been generally lacklustre  definitely a good movie to watch as it does what it is supposed to in that it is generally a setup film for something bigger in the mcu like many of the other marvel films in the mcu  they have to start somewhere  as an origin film it does it very well and perhaps the best origin / starting film for superhero movies that is full of action  decent story that is somewhat predictable (as it is for most origin stories) though generally fresh  fun and great characters  definitely one to watch final verdict   does what it is meant to do and provides the entertainment while doing it ,Positive
1562,generally speaking  the story has nothing special to me  but still good and solid  what i really find outstanding are many of the action scenes  the action and cgi in the final act are amazing  definitely one of the best in the entire mcu i'd like to point out the soundtrack  it's really good ,Positive
1563,this movie was perfect  allot of action plus allot of comedy  this is the funniest marvel movie ever  also the storyline is pretty good  considering that this movie used to be a comic and now it's a movie it's pretty good and they did a good job on it ,Positive
1564,as a positive thing  i liked the idea of combat without using so many and sophisticated weapons ,Positive

1567,"people voted 8 10  rly? for what? story line is primitive and the gaps filled with some martial arts  ""and the legend of the ten rings"" there was no any legend at all  just rings which give some super powers we see them in the begging of the movie and at the end  producers added ben kingsley and benedict wong to tailor shang chi to other mcu movies  but it feels so disconnected like billy bob thornton as a santa in bad santa  michelle yeoh is playing crouching tiger again  it's so sad that hollywood does not give her non kung fu roles  she has talent for sure in short  after 1hr i started to check my watch because the whole thing was so boring i just wanted it to end ",Negative
1568,this is the movie im waiting for  next level of visual effects in shang chi ,Neutral
1569,this movie is so good  its the best superhero movie of 2021  i am not a marvel fan but i watch some marvel movies like 'loki' but this movie is just in a another level sooo goood just love it ,Positive
1570,fun  solid blockbuster elevated by its sensitive treatment of culture and the migrant experience  the fight choreography was excellent  best i've seen in a while   dynamic  engaging  fresh  the soundtrack was also incredible the film takes care to depict the lives of millenial asian migrants  including all the karaoke (!) (source: i am an asian millennial migrant)strongest point of the movie is the always superb tony leung  who really brings the character of wenwu to life  one of the best   honestly  the best  marvel villain to date  my only wish was that michelle yeoh had a bit more to do on screen ,Positive
1571,great movie  lots of surprises  the plot isn't predictable  main characters are great  love the fight scenes   not gratuitous but well choreographed and entertaining  multidimensionality of the antagonists is intelligent  sir ben's role is humorous  post credits are great  great dynamic between shang and katy  can't wait to see where this leads next  marvel needs to continue in this trajectory as opposed to other directions of inclusivity  which end up being exclusionary to many people ,Positive
1572,like the title i typed  i was not expecting that at all  with the lack of advertising and no hype except from the shangchi actor himself i was expecting a low budget film with no plot but instead i got a fine course meal with a side of surprisement  i watched with amazement at the acting skills  the fighting skills (the training and hard work)  the music (was lit af  it gave me into the spiderverse vibes )  the unsuspecting plot  the comedy  the characters and cgi  all of it was amazing and i will definitely watch it again and can't wait to show it to my parents  well done shangchi cast and crew you've out done yourself!,Positive
1573,"i would say that i really enjoyed this movie i' mabe a big comic book fan     but would say it would be a fun movie for action film lovers  if you are one that loves to watch the end
credit scene i don't think that there was much excitement was already predictable i'm used to the post credit scenes giving a surprise so other than that great movie !",Positive
1574,10/10 this is my new favorite marvel movie  it has incredibly choreographed fight scenes  so much humor  and a really strong sense of heart and love  i missed movies like this ,Positive
1575,this is a nice movie and as expected i am amazed of the variable fight scenes  congrats to the director for the various stunts and breathtaking scenes  the characters also played well ,Positive
1576,i really enjoyed the soundtrack  i thought it was a beautiful mix of modern and traditional music  the film itself was very well done  the cgi and animation was great as well as the acting  the story line and origin story was very though out and was very interesting ,Positive
1577,typically  there's a line to be drawn between mixing genres  and to a certain degree shang chi and the legend could easily be categorized as being just another knock off of the crouching tiger  hidden dragon type chinese legend tale but thankfully  marvel were (more than ) able to avoid that mistake  they achieved this by making sure to meld only the best aspects of chinese martial arts culture with the best aspects of marvel universe  superhero tenets i won't include spoilers  suffice to say  this turned out to be an epic display of action  fantasy  thriller and just enough lighter humor to not come across as try hard  cheesy in all  if you're a fan of both chinese martial arts  fantasy legend and marvel universe  you will almost definitely enjoy  what i can easily see (imho) as becoming a classic ,Positive
1578,   suddenly  unexpectedly  and before us is one of the best creations of marvel in its entire modern history  lasting already 14 years! a colorful  interesting  tasty  emotional  spectacular and bright spectacle should not leave anyone indifferent with a 'plus' sign  even though this character is not named      by 2021  the 'marvel' projects have reached such grandeur and scale that local producers can afford to experiment with certain characters unknown to the mass audience  but probably known to ardent fans of this huge comic book universe  'the eternals'  'shan chi'    how many more new movie characters and new surprises are waiting for us?! of course  it is difficult to say  however  given the frank failure of the first and the success of the second  everything is not so simple here! we will dwell on the second in more detail (for obvious reasons)!!   this film  which is more than 2 hours long  tells us about such magical accessories as 10 rings  which give their owner unknown power  strength and immortality  at the same time  family joy/tragedy/joy is unfolding before us with numerous rather big flashbacks to the past  where the same 10 rings play a central role  without which  as judging from the title of the tape and its viewing  we will not get anywhere! as it turned out  we are in for a bit of fantasy and mysticism  a couple of familiar characters from previous 'marvel' projects  a certain secluded area like wakanda (only now with an asian tint)  as well as a colorful spectacle and  in principle  a very  very high quality film    ,Positive
1579,"it was so full of potential  the opening sets a great foundation for the movie  with a fine fusion of the distinct aesthetic of ""wuxia"" (chinse martial art) and western/modern cool ass elements  and great action parts  the movie could have became a unique and refreshing piece  instead  it ends up as a cliche superhero story that attempts to discuss the chinese cultural significance and understanding of family  but fails to do so in depth  countless plot tools that barely make sense  such as katy being able to hit at the evil creature's face  or the mysterious abrupt awaken of the dragon when summoned by shangchi  are employed to conform to the typical expectations of a super hero movie  the costume design and mythical creatures at the end further worsened the movie experience by wiping out completely the remaining wuxia atmosphere  which in my opinion  is the best part of this movie  shangchi and the legend of the ten rings really doesn't live up to my expectations of mcu's phase 4 works  it's watchable  but i wouldn't recommend it ",Positive
1580,i went into this knowing 0 about shang chi  never saw him in any of my comic reading as a kid or anything (i read punisher  helstrom  hulk and ghost rider!) so i didn't know what to expect  and let me tell you    it blew me away the visuals   stunningthe action   flawlessthe casting   sublimepossibly one of my fave mcu films  and i was pleasantly surprised by this!,Positive
1581,the 10 rings was the best weapon in marvel movies  the animation and action was beyond amazing   ,Positive
1582,as an asian man  i really wanted to like this movie  but it was just not good  i fell asleep multiple times during the movie and my kids didn't even want to finish the movie  unfortunate ,Negative
1583,wow   disney has seriously rigged the game here  noticed most of disney movies now are full of fake reviews which are written by people of slightly better intellect and a little more fancy than good old one liner fake reviews   however you can still spot them by their rather generically customized statements this was a pretty average movie and could be a 4 but just to counter so many fake reviews i tried to give it 1  it initially gave me error if i selected anything lower than 7   wow  but after pressing it constantly  it allowed to go lower  the movie itself is pretty average  extremely cliche character development and ordinary action ,Positive
1584,first of all i'm glad marvel did an asian movie so called legend of ten rings  cgi is perfect  casting actors and actresses from china is the right move  but the main casting and supporting just don't click  plus the story like feels like the writer doesn't have a clue on chinese culture or just finish up as school homework kinda of storyline  if marvel plan to add this story and character into future sequence  huge mistake!!!,Positive
1585,i mean this move was just a fun ride from start to finish with secrets and just really good nods to asian mythology ,Positive
1586,honestly one of the best marvel movies made to date  up to par and could even surpass black panther  the acting (especially tony leung  the dad) was incredible  along with the visuals  soundtrack  storyline  and writing  loved how they actually spoke chinese in the authentic scenes vs making them speak english the whole time with an accent  true to the asian culture  and definitely did us proud!,Positive
1587,the visual is stunning and the action sequence enjoyable  other than that  there is no other redeeming quality  plot is meh  non american actors other than michell yeoh dialog is dull and seemed be going through the mills  even awkwardfina is really awkward  the main protaganist looks like winnie the pooh  i believe this is targeted at the taste of a certain demographics and seems to be the dominating market force of the movie industry these days  rip ,Positive
1588,shang~chi is absolutely brilliant  go see it at your earliest convenience  the fight scenes were almost balletic & i was on the verge of tears & roaring with laughter at some parts  i came out of the cinema feeing the same way i did after seeing black panther  this film was so needed  easily straight into my top5 mcu films ,Positive
1589,there are a lot of times that i noticed bad cgi or simple errors like car that lost its mirror and mirror reappears in the next shotunstoppable bus is a big clichestory jumps too much and characters was weak for my liking ,Negative
1590,too naive plot for so many violent moments the movie was too many times cringe worthy some good flights awful ending it's looks like marvel often now gows for more young   sometimes very young audience ,Positive
1591,finally i'm penning down my thoughts about this movie  the anticipation took hold of me knowing that tony leung is finally getting his hollywood break    that gave me euphoria  imagine this was the first movie that i've watched in the cinema after the outbreak    imagine the excitement  right?but heads up to self  never enter a cinema hall with skyrocketed expectations or else you'll get hit by devastation  oh dear  what went wrong? how i'd wish the film strayed away from those typecast and stereotypical characterisations of the asian community  we don't need to be fed with such storyline  i was hoping destin would go deeper on a more profound route of cultural reality and beliefs  not the whole 'you need to ace in life with a great job  not working aimlessly as a parking valet'  then we have an extremely dubious role in katy  there was no clear indication of her personality other than being his sidekick with no power or ability and of course  a jester to the narrative  i would either buff her role up or omit her out completely by replacing katy with a worthy character like xialing in terms of character prominence  she should have been the chosen one to cross over with shang chi at the end  not katy  and i was left baffled by that  a worthy mate for drama and action  no? the saving grace of the film was the wealth of experience and weight carried by tony leung  michelle yeoh and ben kingsley  they tried to strengthen what can be seen as a potential yet flawed narrative  yet their brilliance was cornered by the weaker leads my verdict? any sequel without tony leung? count me out   ,Positive
1592,"shang chi  is an excellent kung fu movie  and it's the less ""marvel"" movie of the marvel movies  i mean that as a compliment  there's not much connection to anything else  not 50 characters included for no reasons  not a ""check it out guys  it's gonna be so cool in the next movie  i promise!"" vibe  that damages the story it's basically a less poetic and less romantic ""crouching tiger  hidden dragon""  michelle yeoh (still friggin awesome and butt kicking at 59 years old) is even playing in both movies there's pretty colors  fantastical elements  comedy elements    but under everything  there's a cool story of revenge  of abandonment  of murder  of family and grief  well  it's a great kung fu movie  not a formulaic super hero movie simu liu is really charismatic and the fight scenes are awesome (some still sucks  though  because of too much cgi) the actress that plays shang chi's sister is great too and i hope we see her in more movies well  everybody is fantastic in the movie (especially ben kingsley) it's been a while that i didn't loved a marvel movie so much and it gives me some optimism on what can still happen with the mcu ",Positive
1593,i did not have high expectations for this movie  like many  i wasn't familiar with this hero going in that being said  the choreography in action scenes was phenomenal  definitely the highlight of the film for me if you're a fan of film  you will enjoy this beautiful movie ,Positive
1594,so much of this movie looked incredibly fake  a movie like this could've been more focused on martial arts but instead it's bright flashy colors in scenes that look fake  the dialogue was corny as well but i didn't mind the story  even if it was poorly paced  i don't know if the budget was lower  but it seems to me that  as with black panther  when one of their films is built to include a new culture  the cgi has been awful  maybe because they spent less as a lack of faith? regardless  not a great movie  3/10 ,Negative
1595,i was wondering what marvel/disney will add to a kung fu movie; absolutely nothing  might as well call it shang chi and last dragon makes no sense at all  plot is very weak  and the movie makes predecessor and successors really problematic after introducing this childish universe that actually wont fit anywhere in the chosen story lines ,Positive
1596,"movie is heavily overrated and doesn't bring anything new in mcu  poor dialogue and stereotype acting and dragons seen previously in so many movies  i neven understood how someone masters kung fu only after hearing something philosophical like ""know yourself"" or something self discovery in so many movies  the good old kung fu so adulterated with cgi that it looks terrible  there were some good performance by ben kingsley and shang chi's girlfriend (funny expression) but rest of the cast was ordinary ",Positive
1597,"the good
trevor returns!the first asian american fantasy/martial arts movie (?!)some decent looking cg creatures and fxthe usual marvel references to other moviesthe post credit scenethe bad
the script puts a lot of emphasis on the variety of locations as the adventure unfolds  unfortunately somehow forgets its characters need to show some believable ""emotions"" too  so  basically because of this  there   firstly   is no real depth in character development and   secondly   as a consequence no chemistry between any of the characters at allthe story is extremely foreseeable and doesn't have any surprises which wouldn't be a problem  if the story is at least presented in a manner that actually was exciting and engaginga completely underused tony leung who doesn't even need to act at allmost of the fighting choreography felt a bit amateur ishsome asian clichés are really presented as clichés (karaoke  not understanding the 4 sounds in mandarin  underground fight club)the hiphop music parts were actually more annoying than fittingsome of the language spoken mixes us english with some mandarin words  but they are somehow never translated (qingming jié!?) so  what's the audience of this film? chinese american teenagers? american teenagers? everyone?!the humor is often very flat and one dimensionalthere will be a sequel   for people who want a brainless family film with the usual ""hero needs to suffer to be strong"" storyline  give it a try  for anyone who wants a much more fun chinese wu xia/fantasy series  go watch ""douluo continent"" (not the animation)  a low budget drama  but it's comparably funny  well presented and the characters are actually likable  plus good fx and an interesting and complex ""magic"" system!sorry  shang chi  hope your tie in into the expanded marvel universe will give you better roles in the future ",Positive
1598,the plot is mediocre  the acting was particularly awesome  special effects was above average  but not superb relevance to the mcu  it's very intriguing if you are a marvel fanboy/girl (just like me)  you gonna like this one (unless you are being subjective to certain casts or film crew) if not  just watch it for fun and leave if you don't like it ,Positive
1599,phenomenal! absolutely phenomenal! i was worried going into this movie wondering how shang chi was going to fit into the mcu  by the 23rd minute    i had a fair idea  by the finale  it was crystal clear  the doors of what is possible in the mcu has been truly kicked off it's hinges!guaranteed come monday morning  kids around the world will be busting their parents chops to get into a martial art class  marvels newest addition to the live action roster will have the same impact as bruce lee and jackie chan had on many here growing up  it's a certainty action scenes are aplenty and jaw dropping  i have seen way too many martial art movies but this for sheer creativity is up there with the best  score is beautifully written  story although predictable  does what it needs to do without grinding the movie to a halt  acting is top notch especially with the lead simu liu and tony leung chui wai if i had one bad thing to say about it  it's this    i had to procrastinate either going to the toilet or urinating myself on the seat! yes it moves that fast  an extremely easy 10/10 phase 4 is off to a flyer!,Positive
1600,first half is good full of life chemistry between chracters is so great but second half is messed up bad script  lousy dialogues overacting and so predictable ,Positive
1601,"cliché upon cliché terrible acting terrible dialogue terribly boring plot so dumb possibly one of the worst movies ever made  worst than green lantern      
i wanted to stop after 20 minutes  i should have ",Negative
1602,"after watching this movie in the theater  i thought  ""wow  that was not what i expected  it was more visually appealing than i thought it would be""  at 2nd watch  i really was impressed how rock solid the story was  i loved the way they humanized xu wenwu and made this a tragic love story  the acting was amazing when it came from the amazing actors (obviously)  tony leung  ben kingsley and michelle yeoh are legends and acted accordingly  simu liu will rightfully be a superstar because of his performance  i want to see more of meng'er zhang  i think that she has huge potential  my only disappointment was how quickly death dealer died  andy le is an awesome performer combining everything  this may be my favorite marvel movie of all time    and i didn't even mention morris!",Positive
1603,this could have been a great movie  but it wasn't  it began well and ended well  everything in between was pretty lame  disney has the disney plus platform where they could have built up this character since no one really knows who shang chi is  unfortunately  disney didn't do that so most of the minute i'm just left wondering why do i care  with so much asian culture to pull from i wish disney would have done more  3 out of 10 stars  other reviews i'm sure are paid for ,Positive
1604,what an amazing movie by marvel studios! i was hyped for the movie since the first teaser and the movie actually exceedes my expectations  marvel has been showing its marvelous magic since ironman  and shang chi is another diamond in the crown  after the end of mcu's phase 3  fans were eagerly waiting for a big movie  black widow was not up to the mark and eternals also disappointed majority of fans  but chang chi filled their gap  the action scenes were fresh and engaging  martial arts combined with chinese mythological powers makes these action scenes more interesting  character arc and story building were satisfying  they were not rushed or slow paced  whole movie was engaging till the end  i would love to see another movie of this franchise ,Positive
1605,i was pleasantly surprised by the twist and turns in the plot  great acting and a great script! a very good movie! a very well balanced storyline and spectacular special effects  and great martial arts scenes  i also liked the comedy ,Positive
1606,"while i wouldn't sit for a rewatch  shang chi was a fine feature film  the action sequences we're for the most part solid  highlighted by an early duel between two masters of martial arts which took great inspiration from the light and flowing fights of traditional asian movies a la ""crouching tiger""  on the other end of the spectrum was the rushed and dull car escape about two thirds the way through  many other parts of the movie fell along a similar spectrum: our protagonist and his sister were rich and flowing characters  while their friend katy and much of the supporting cast felt rushed and dull  additionally  the movie spends a significant amount of time painting lore and background knowledge while skirting around essential questions  like  ""what is the function of the 10 rings?"" ""what is the prejudice between xu wenwu and the residents of ta lo "" and ""did shang chi actually get stronger in his late training sequence?"" the writers seem to feel that a lot of things needed to happen for the movie to work  and while the rush between characters  moments and events isn't clumsy  it is rarely very satisfying ",Positive
1607,i couldn't take my eyes off this film  acting was superb  awkwafina brought the comedy and simu liu was just the perfect protagonist   warm  relatable and kind  marvel really pulled all the stops in creating this masterpiece  the fight sequence between xu wenwu and leiku wu at the beginning was so stunning   fighting incorporated with dancing   it was truly wonderful  can't wait to see this unravel onwards  great job!,Positive
1608,i thought the storyline is fine  the chinese (& unfortunately some japanese) elements incorporated shows that they did a lot of research  and it didn't feel pandering  the set and the special effects during some fight scenes are absolutely stunning  i also thought the dialogues about remembering your roots and your name not only represents an important pillar of chinese morals  but a timely message that a lot of immigrants can relate to however  i think tony leung's acting completely stole the show  so much that it completely overshined shang chi's story arc  from start to end  i was way more invested in his performance and his character  while his death felt rushed and left me wanting more  i also thought it's a pity that the sister's story arc got set aside for awkwafina's  because it could be so important to shang chi's character development i thought the storytelling at the first half of the story is surprisingly captivating  and i wished the second half didn't lose that element to incorporate more fight scenes  but i enjoyed it overall ,Positive
1609,"this movie is better than other ""super hero"" theme movies  fighting scenes moved to a new level  incredible moves of different martial arts styles looks awesome  and of course a pinch of humor in a right moments but it is quite predictable  you start to watch and you already know who will become who and so on overall  it is well done movie filled up with awesome special effects  great storyline  totaly recommending to watch ",Positive
1610,for thousands of years they were guarding the gate and it that thing was killed that way  soo easily !!!!! really ? although  the biganing was good  nice action but lateron there was nothing new  marvel is much better in concepts ,Positive
1611,this movie made me sad  it is the first time i felt that they made a movie long after credits scene  this should not have been a movie on it's own  theese characters could have easily have been introduced inside a bigger story  the plot was sooo weak and the bad guys lacked personality completely  the dragon and the soul eater fight was aweful  it gave the marvel universe nothing at all  this movie will have a very hard time fixing up a sequel nothing to engage the audience  mediocre visual effects as well  very unlike marvel standard  on the whole  a weak movie ,Negative
1612,i really enjoyed this movie  my son and i went to see it saturday of opening weekend  and i am so glad we did  the cinematography and choreography create a visually stunning movie  with a lot of wuxia mixed in for scenes involving the mother and her people (thing crouching tiger  hidden dragon)  with some more traditional mcu fighting in others (the bus scene and the fight outside the skyscraper!)  simu liu is adorable and wonderful  and although i am not a fan of akwafina i will say she did a good job in this role  and michelle yeoh is always beautiful and engaging in everything she does  however  for me  tony leung was amazing  he conveys so many emotions effortlessly  he is not a remorseless killing machine  he has a purpose  and although misguided  he believe in it  he's also smoking hot so he has that going for him  this movie reminds me of black panther  both have strong story lines and are visually arresting  and they don't need the entire mcu to move the plot  i would highly recommend seeing it; you won't ne disappointed ,Positive
1613,"movie started out solid but just got more predictable and mediocre as it went a long  the acting was good and the visuals were great but the story is essentially the same cookie cutter we have seen a million times it really feels like marvel is 0/2 post end game with this and black widow the other thing that forces the score down for me is bri larson's insignificant cameo (she just is not good for her role and has zero charisma! and the forced ""girl power"" moments  what ever happened to just showing strong female characters without having to ""tell"" the audience   it has now become the eye roll moment of marvel movies would not recommend paying to see this and would wait for it to come to disney plus ",Positive
1614,amazing real action  not sure if actor simu liu knows martial arts at all but his fighting scene surely makes it look like he's a possessed martial artist  funny & beautiful  the beginning taichi scene was so pretty and soothing  worth every penny! 3d is a must ,Positive
1615,i have just arrived home from the cinema  whilst i have seen the majority of the mcu movies many times  i hope i never see this one again  it's beyond me how some people can give this high ratings  there were some good actions scenes which generated the 2 stars but that's as far as it goes  i like ben kingsley  but what was his character doing in the movie?   it was completely out of place and had a ridiculous story line as to why he was there  however it did add the funniest part to the movie where he thought the apes in the original planet of the apes films were actually apes  my wife  who is a big mcu fan  also thought it was poor  my 11 year old son thought it was ok because he was proud of himself for recognising wong & abomination  i am going to cheer myself up now by watching ' the face of fu manchu'   that's go a proper villain in it ,Positive
1616,omg  i love superhero movies and all but this one? the worst i've seen  feels like a cheap production  bad humor  script  special effects    this is a 4 stars movie  max ,Negative
1617,this was so epic on so many levels  far surpassed any expectations  the story was fantastic  visually stunning  and the fight sequences were phenomenal! my favorite marvel movie in a long time  outstanding  so excited for the rest of phase 4 ,Positive
1618,very very bad movie  its just a martial arts movie where everyone has powers and is special  even the friend of the protagonist in less than 3 days turns into legolas    ,Negative
1619,well it is a good movie with a great cast  but the 10 rings( the weapons and the group) seemed secondary to the plot  yes they were there but was not a driving force towards the plot  marvel knew they dropped tge ball with the mandarin but buried it more with this  seemed like they put ghostrider and and iron fist together  the villige is k'un lun in a sense  mystic village that is only accessible during a certain time period  and the soul eater is pretty much dark heart from the nick cage ghostrider  still a good movie  just borrow to much from other marvel properties ,Positive
1620,unfortunately its just another dime a douzen superhero movie nothing is different with this one  typical predictable story  cool cgi and thats about it cgi good like they usually are for these types but personally thats all there is you can predict the next scene before it starts and you can predict the ending perfectly on point if you've been watching superhero movies has for shang chi  theres nothing different  i got bored half way through and came back just for the ending  wasn't impressed all that much i think these should be released directly to streaming platforms  that would be a better fit ,Positive
1621,this movie have little comedy like ant man  this movie have to been in you guys watchlist ,Negative
1622,"the movie is long and kinda boring but it has great comedy
a hand to hand fight like jackie chan
it contains a very wonderful fantasy world with dragons ",Positive
1623,i went to watch shang chi and the legend of the ten rings last night and it does not disappoint at all this is a character i am not very familiar with in regards to the mcu  however  having watched it  i hope we see more of him sooner rather than later the film starts with how shang chi's father wenwu discovered the 10 rings and used them to topple governments and change the outcome of certain world events  then how he wants to try and find the mystical village of tao lo as this is the last area of the world he hasn't conquered eventually finding the entrance to the lost village he finds a young lady guarding the entrance  in time they fall in love and he gives up the 10 rings to be with her cut to 1996 and they're living in married bliss with baby shang chi having been born and his sister soon after  they're given two pendants but their mother as we discover that she was killed and her father took up the 10 rings again we then discover a grown up shang chi (or shaun as he is now known) living in san francisco as a car valet with his friend katy (played brilliantly by the actress awkwafina)  as they're travelling to work on a bus henchmen sent by his father attack him  what follows is a very well choreographed fight seen and lots of destruction realising the pendent has been stolen by the henchmen shaun races back home to his apartment to grab clothes for a flight to macau  to try and save his sister from losing her pendent not wishing to miss out  katy insists on joining shaun for the ride  on the flight over shaun explains he is not the man who katy thought he was and explains his past when he arrives in macau he goes to the address on a postcard which he assumed was sent by his sister  it turns out his sister runs an illegal fight club where huge amounts of betting takes place inside and online shaun is already well known thanks to a youtube video of his exploits in san francisco going viral  he also finds out he is going to be the main attraction and lots of money has already been bet on him a fight is already going on and a familiar face is taking part  i will not spoil that bit for you  as he goes into the ring the opponent appears and it turns out to be his sister chaos then ensues as the same henchmen have arrived at the illegal fighting den after the second pendent  the fight scenes which take place on scaffolding between shaun  his sister and his fathers henchmen are breath taking and it really makes you feel as though you're high up on the side of a building they're eventually captured and taken back to their former home  when it is explained that their dad hears their mum calling to him and he believes she is still alive but being kept captive by the elders in tao lo  he must go and find tao lo but can only find the correct path once a year and that time is soon meanwhile he locks all 3 up in a dungeon as they will not help him go and find their mother  what follows is absolutely hilarious as an old character from the iron man franchise makes an appearance while they're in the dungeon they're introduced to a creature from tao lo called morris and they find out from this creature that there is a much quicker way to get to tao lo  so  stealing a car  they head to the lost village upon arriving they meet their aunt who is also mourning the loss of her sister  they are told about and ancient evil that eats souls and many cities fell to it and was only defeated by the help of a dragon  shang chi and xialing are given dragon scale armor (a gift from their mother)  katy trains with a bow and arrow and shaun trains with his aunt to learn the dragon magic fighting style the 10 rings then attack the village with shaun fighting his father first on the side of the lake which he is then sent crashing into  while unconscious under water he learns his power can call the guardian dragon meanwhile at the entrance of the of the cave where his father believes his mother is calling from  his father can be seen trying to break into the cave  which eventually releases bat like creatures that suck up the souls of individuals continuing to try and release his wife  wenwu releases the mother of all beasts and a battle ensues  sadly we see wenwu killed as his soul is sucked out by one of the bat like creatures  but  not before himself and shaun battle it out against each other  upon his death  the 10 rings are passed on to shaun  the battle comes to an end and the villagers mourn the loss of those lost in battle we then get taken back to san francisco where shaun and katy are telling their story to two friends who look at them as though they're going mad and in fact one complains that she is having the mickey taken out of her the closing scene sees a popular character appear and both shaun and katy follow them  which gives a clue i suspect as to how phase 4 will pan out in the future of the mcu there are two closing credit scenes  one where we find both shaun and katy in a building and other marvel characters have appeared  again  this shows where the mcu is going the second involves his sister   but that is all i will reveal as this will also show what i think is going to be the direction of the mcu there are little snippets within the film that also mention past events  can you hear and find them?overall this is a brilliant film! some very good special effects  the music score is good  some very funny characters too  i think this is a very good start to phase 4 and miles better than black widow as my title suggests please ignore the 1 * reviews on here  i suspect they're dc fans in disguise trying to make mcu look bad  but  by all means read them and make up your own mind by going to watch shang chi and the legend of the ten rings  i don't think you'll be disappointed ,Positive
1624,i was truly hyped for this movie just by seeing the bus clip and the trailer  i'm a huge marvel fan (not a comic reader)  so i didn't know anything about shang chi  only heard about him  after seeing this movie  i was truly amazed  it was funny  the action sequences were very amazing  the fight choreography was awesome  reminded me of jackie chan  cgi was amazing i gotta say  after seeing the movie  shang chi is in my top 3 favorite marvel charachters  and the best mcu movie for me its worth watching  don't listen to the negative reviews  go see it ,Positive
1625,this was a kung fu movie  and a classic marvel movie  wrapped into one  the smartly placed humor  the superhero emergent story  the spectacularly choreographed fight sequences    it's truly a masterpiece that i'm happy to watch again and again ,Positive
1626,i saw this today at the bfi london imax with my 14 year old and his friend and we all enjoyed this immensely! its thrilling & races along at a great pace from the first scene! it is the perfect mix of action fantasy & lighthearted comedy with a decent story line to bind it all together  one could say another typical marvel movie churned out of their factory production line  however  i felt that this one really is miles better than so many of the recent ones due to the incredible martial arts fight scenes  they are so fast it's really exciting to watch  i also enjoyed the fact that i didn't recognise any of the main actors other than ben kingsley (who is hilarious) this often makes a movie much easier to get into than when it's the same old super star faces  no hesitation to recommend   great for the kids and the adults too ,Positive
1627,i didn't have high expectations going to a marvel movie but  i can't believe i am saying it  it was really entertaining and a very good movie especially the acting  i hated when the dragons entered the story and i hated it more when they fought  switching from a nice story and buildup to end up with some stupid unnecessary fight similar to got was an extremely bad idea ,Negative
1628,the story telling  the act of tony leung  the chinese elements this time are really authentic and didn't make me feel weird for i believe the very first time from watching the hollywood movie  whether it's the creatures  family relationships  even the language speaking this time is really legit  this is such a great movie ,Positive
1629,no one to really write reviews but after seeing this thought i would tell people how good this film is   i thought i would like it a mix of martial arts and marvel but it far exceeded expectations   it's fun with a great story and fantastic action but the comedy bits are hilarious a must see for any marvel fan 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻,Positive
1630,different to black panther  who had been already introduced in civil war  shang chi is presented from scratch using an arch we're all already too familiar with  but adding lots of new characters  martial arts and a glimpse to a new universe inside the mcu  although at some moments abusing the use of fantastical elements  ben kingsley and awkwafina provide the comic relief the mcu has gotten us used to  super enjoyable!marvel might have its own highs and lows  but it always delivers ,Positive
1631,bland pandering to the chinese market with mystical martial arts and nothing explained  there's no tie in with main marvel universe that drives plot forward  just pointless cameos that amount to a shrug emoji from the other mcu heroes  don't pay to see it if you can avoid it ,Negative
1632,awesome! i enjoyed it a lot  visually entertaining  this is the best from marvel since the end game!asians rule! i just wish they included more cast from north east and south east asia! it would have been an even better representation!10/10! a great labor day weekend movie treat!,Positive
1633,props to dianey/marvel on making a differwnt movie! it seems like it's embedded a lot of fighting styles (eg  kung fu) into one movie  this is different from a traditional marvel movie  thus  makes it amazing!,Positive
1634,i am so glad theatres are open where i live and what a visual treat this movie is  from the characters to the battles and everything  this movies is a must watch in theatres (sorry for bad english),Negative
1635,"the dialogue of the entire cast is trash  it creates so many plot holes and is amateur at best then the sister hardly says anything throughout the movie so much so that you would think she can't speak the action is fine  the world and ""home"" is fine but geez who the heck wrote this ",Positive
1636,as a non marvel fans  i give this movie with 10/10 score  beside the good acting and fighting style  i found this interesting culture where the chinese fiction culture was storied moreover  i watch this movie because there's one of my favorite actress  yeah she is awkwafina who always look like silly wherever she roles any movie oh yeah one more thing  honestly  all the fiction animals on this movie are disgusting ,Positive
1637,"great action  great sci fi  great scenario
another wonderful movie just has been added to the mcu ",Positive
1638,"this is just a bow to china from marvel  and that's it  half the movie is just daddy issues and forced racial jokes the other half is chinese mythology and tribute to kung fu movies    only a cameo and an after credit scene ""connects"" the shaun dufe and whatever the hell thosw rings are to the mcu  loosely   ",Negative
1639,well    this movie is far from my optimistic expectations and also far from my pessimistic expectations  in case you don't want to read the rest of it  it's not bad but it's still not really good  in case you want to however  just keep reading shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is frankly an overrated mediocre formulaic marvel solo origin movie that succeeds in terms of action because of course it does and a very formulaic yet fair job in terms of plot but fails a lot in terms of character the action: at this point action scenes and choreography for these movies should only be noted if they are surprisingly awful  i mean like come on! a major studio owned by none other than walt freaking disney that has enough money to buy the sun itself makes a movie about martial arts in the 2020s and you expect anything but sheer awesomeness?! oh don't get me wrong  it's marvelous (pun intended) how much passion  talent and hard work has gone through this the plot: the plot of this movie is like the plot of frozen ii  star wars' sequel trilogy  no time to die and captain marvel  a plot that independently judged  isn't that bad  it has a narrative that isn't too full of plot holes and enough explanation and backstory to make it seem more grand  it even has some supposedly dark and emotional moments  however  just like the titles named above  it really is in fact a formulaic plot put together seemingly by a bunch of marketers who wanted to sell a product more rather than tell a story  almost every single plot point can be easily predicted 5 sequences beforehand  the majority of the first half's plot is alright though  the plot of the second half of the movie however is honestly shallow and empty because unlike the majority of the first half it needs the audience to care for the characters and that is really where the movie drops the ball the characters: the characters in this movie are either really really formulaic or they just don't do anything that would leave an impact  you got the protagonist  the dude this movie is named after  shang chi  who despite being much more energetic than the posters and trailer thumbnails suggest is truly incomplete and by the end of the movie is yet to be properly introduced  let's compare him with ant man  in 2015's ant man you get a decent story you might not fully remember a week later  you get a villain you might forget a day later and you might even argue that most of the supporting cast is also rather forgettable  what you can't deny though  is that the movie introduces you to ant man  you know what he's mostly like and you know what impact certain events can have on him  in shang chi for instance there is a scene where shang reveals to ms  comic relief that he actually went after the man responsible for his mother's death and killed him when he was still a teenager  now this should've and would've been a fantastic character reveal if only we really knew what shang chi is and was like and how he has changed from his dark past or even if we had gotten to know and appreciate their friendship so that we would've wondered what this reveal means for their friendship  instead we don't know any of those and therefore that so called shocking reveal is merely like a fact made known to us  shang chi spends most of the movie dealing with random things that he's either thrown into or pulled into  everything he does in regards to even the storylines that involve his family are as if everything is just a list of facts thrown in  we don't get to know what he's like deep down  what he alone feels for his friend  his sister  his mother or his father  we don't know what he's thinking or if he's feeling something and is trying to suppress his emotions with he's training  he just says that they did this and that to him or his sister  that his mother was nice and his father like this and that again as if he's just explaining backstory  if instead they had him explain it rather emotionally vulnerable to his friend in a time of loneliness and not fully as how things were (his point of view and not exactly what happened) it would've evolved his character  him and ms  comic relief's friendship and maybe even his sister's and his father's characters if they got to reveal their perspectives  the sister is truly meh because you could just straight up edit her out and maybe keep her for the sequels and all you'd miss would be some boring shallow women can also fight messages that btw are so primitive that it's actually mildly insulting that the creators felt like their audience actually needed such messages  there are some good ideas behind the father's arc that got me a little interested at first but again  we don't really get to be in his shoes and really feel what his powers and centuries of knowledge and lust for power do to a person and what having a wife that changes such a man for the better can look like  we're just introduced to all of it as if it's just a list of facts that needs checking out  ms  comic relief aka awkwafina embodies a certain percentage of what is wrong with this movie  she's an annoying good for nothing comic relief who moves along with anything just because the movie says she's shang's friend and also because the creators knew that adding a comic relief would bring some more money  oh and did i say good for nothing? well fear not because also as a boring cliché the useless comic relief must all of a sudden out of the freaking blue become useful  she just freaking learns how to be legolas with some training and takes down a full blown threat to humanity with a one of a kind trick shot another big flaw of the movie is it's sometimes unnecessary over the top moments  the bus fight should've just been a cool fight in the bus but then turned into this huge mess but it was still okay  what dropped the ball in this case was the huge soal sucking creatures that were all of a sudden shoved into the movie and were immediately represented as a threat to the world or the universe or something  this didn't work well because of 2 reasons that are very connected to each other one is that in the mcu we've come to see so many avengers level threats that having another and expecting it to be good must be done in a newer and more creative way  just putting a big monster is very unimaginative the second and more complete reason is that just like no time to die the movie spends most of its time reveling in what seems like a personal territory for the protagonist and then all of a sudden the threat is worldwide  both no time to die and shang chi would've benefited from a more personal and grounded environment  bond is in the end a british agent and shang chi is a warrior with a dark family past that keeps coming back to him and having him take down a cult led and created by his own father which still seems like a huge feat and there's no real need to amp it up by adding magical dragons and monsters  at least if like the suicide squad 2021 they built up the huge worldwide threats from the beginning the audience would've had more time to have a grasp on how grave the situation would be had the protagonists not stopped it in summery this movie isn't bad and can be at times entertaining and funny but it definitely disappoints it's premise  oh and they also did a good job handling the relations with iron man 3 without taking anything back and ben kingsley was truly superb ,Positive
1640,"to be honest the trailer didn't lure me that much  but being a marvel fan  and being really curious what will happen in this phase  i went and boy!this was so worth the money!it ticked all the boxes what i look for in movies it has a storyline that's interesting  it's also relatable i ab so lut ely love the mythological themes in this and how excellent the special effects were done to bring them to life!so the fantasy theme and mythological themes  but also the friendship and family balance and developments were really nice to see!acting work was fantastically performed and  because marvel  the level of surprises and humor was well above level 10 of appreciation for me (""shang chi?"" ""present!"") i am very curious what the future will bring plus the music and the camera work was amazing (the camera dude did the matrix too  so that's definitely a big win) last but not least  i was afraid of the disconnection to the avengers or other superheroes  but this was referring to our former and older avengers in a very smart way and at the very last; it left us with enough and good questions to keep us peaked for the upcoming films!",Positive
1641,is this marvel? or a really bad computer game  acting was not great  camera work was all over the place  my girlfriend liked the fluffy animals and fight choreography (more like dancing)     i think i now may have brain damage ,Negative
1642,very genuine film  i guess all we were waiting for a new avenger in the crew  the combats and images of this film are amazing  the main character has all the qualities to become a good element in the avengers team ,Positive
1643,the mystery of the ten rings and it's operation was the best thing this movie had going for it  only to be spoiled by cheesy  predictable end of movie sequences and poor characterization  weak ,Negative
1644,throw your expectations based on the marketing and promotional material away  this movie is fantastic  yes  it is focused on the asian culture  no  it is not forced  it actually is beautiful the fighting choreography is fantastic  you like martial arts movies or martial arts in general? go see this one the music is great  the humour is great  actors are cool  ben kingsley has a great cameo  the story is cool  the ten rings will blow your mind  two post credit scenes that will blow your mind and a great soundtrack where black widow felt like another movie of the same marvel formula  this movie has some great surprises and worlds that are fun to explore oh  go see it in theaters and don't wait for it to arrive on disney plus if you have the option to do that  the visuals are stunning 9/10 ,Positive
1645,the whole movie is just a sequence of fillers more less completely useless for the story  katy is the worst character in the marvel universe the movie would be much better without her  i am disapointed and would defintely not reccomend to anyone  the final fight scene was cool thougg ,Negative
1646,i don't know why people giving bad reviews but this movie is a good one to watch the cgi  bgm  action there slots of plus points in the movie the ending 30 min is a rampage  don't fell for negative reviews enjoy it with family and friends ,Positive
1647,i liked the characters but this is a superhero film  the action wasn't great and they never explained the powers of the rings  it's hard to know how much to appreciate a fight when the power of the rings are unknown/limitless  the last battle is a let down as well and could have featured the main character more ,Positive
1648,first i had some concerns just about the fact that shang chi is a complete new carachter we never met before and new surroundings  well this movie is an emotional rollercoaster  worked out beautiful  with just the exact humor  great actors  very detailled fightscenes  and besides the story is very beautiful  it's about getting justice for their lost mom  and this makes it breathtakingly beautiful ,Positive
1649,another dissapointment from marvel  poor writing and characters development  the story is very not toucing  a movie made just to check a box that is was made ,Negative
1650,totally disappointed  had no preconceptions to follow so watched openminded  sorry to say 2hrs wasted  compared to this crouching tiger a 10  weak story line and characters  i rate all jackie chan films higher  hung out till very end just to see finale      no wow factor  was disney buying marvel a good idea?,Negative
1651,i really enjoyed this movie  the actors were really strong  i liked the fight scenes  it's about time marvel had some martial arts with an asian background in it  the plot was good and seemed to flow well  the humour was good  they tied it in well with some post endgame comments and hidden things in the background  i really hope they continue with this movie and possibly a new avengers movie  the only parts i didn't like were minor and it's toward the end  but i'm not spoiling it  it is definitely worth watching though  i want to watch again ,Positive
1652,if you're here to decide if you should watch it or not  i must encourage you to watch it just saw the movie today  it was great men  the graphics team has done amazing job  and the fight scenes are awesome with the cast of superb acting skills  in other words it is a masterpiece which marvel fan expect ,Positive
1653,shang chi is a culturally accurate film that manages to blend itself in with the marvel formula it's packed with great action  great photography and a beautiful soundtrack the characters are certainly good enough to care about  the story is quite simple to follow  but where it's less good for me is in the decisions made by shang chi's father and ben kinsley who appeared in iron man 3 also feels unnecessary and is basically just like a simple comic reliever character but overall  shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is one of the better marvel movies  with the best action and fantasy elements ever produced by marvel studios ,Positive
1654,this movie just aims to the chinese satisfaction all characters  fantastic beasts  cultural factors come from china  even when somethings appear in japan  malay etc    culture  however the writers still bings its china meaning is there only china in asia!?,Positive
1655,shang chi was hyped so much and i thought it'd be a great movie  something new for the mcu  but it's more or less the same sort of plot  same sort of characters  same sort of disappointing villains  marvel are getting into this 'thing' where they make you think the villain is one thing but it ends up being something else and i'm not really a fan of that  cgi was laughable in some parts but not all that bad  refreshing movie though  some of the best fight scenes we've seen so far in the mcu  they went with the whole family thing  we've seen it a thousands times  but they did a good job at it  was pretty emotional at parts people who are rating it low for being 'boring' have been spoiled by infinity war and endgame thinking there needs to be hundreds of cameos and all the avengers in every marvel movie  grow up  this is a solo movie  simple as  same type of people who rated black widow low because of that  it's not as bad as some people are saying  it's a good introduction movie for shang chi's character and the post credits also leave room for the next mcu projects to come  could develop into something great if they do it right ,Positive
1656,i found the movie enjoyable in parts but there were some boring parts too  it's definitely not a 10/10 movie  in fact nowhere near  it's a decent film that doesn't take itself to seriously but like all of these type of films it's predictable ,Negative
1657,amazing performance from simu liu  so glad that the first asian led film was such a success  hopefully it paves the way for many more plot line was excellent  can easily be watched as a standalone  while still connecting with the mcu for ultra fans ,Positive
1658,do not watch this movie  i repeat   do not watch this movie  you will never get these 2 hours back  do not believe the high ratings   they must be fake  i cannot even believe why someone would rate this anywhere near 10  this is far under 5 in my book  jesus            ,Negative
1659,for the whole film i was glued to the big screen  a unique origin story which at its heart people might say it's a generic hero backstory with a predictive rise to power  but that's exactly why we love these films! amazing fight scenes and the visuals throughout were beautiful  it's exciting to see the introduction of other much more different universe in the mcu  overall this film is beautifully made and an absolute joy to watch  with a great soundtrack too ,Positive
1660,"being an asian  i was expecting this movie before film starts  film is cool  but it always fight fight fight for reason i can't understand exactly it looks like a movie spent a lot of money 
besides that  nothing in there it's disappoint me and i don't recommend it ",Positive
1661,a well made hero and villain  a great watch in the theatre!,Positive
1662,let me start by saying damnnn  marvel made an absoluut banger of a movie  it has one of the most developed antagonist in a marvel film and the cgi is just stunning to watch  let alone a very good story and all the great fight scenes from beginning to end i had one big smile  if this is the first film of phase 4 then i can only expect bigger things to happen of course if you are a marvel fan go watch it!! but also if you are not this is in my opinion the best marvel film made and definitely worth your money phase 4 is destined for greatness ,Positive
1663,having grown up with marvel comics   yep  through the 70's!   i've been a fan of everything that the mcu has produced  however  this film is a move away from all that has come before and may be taking the franchise in a new direction not overly impressed or entertained  very predictable storyline full of cliches  maybe it's one of those films you need to watch a few times before it grows on you  unfortunately  i don't think i could put myself through it to find out 5 stars and i'm probably being over generous ,Positive
1664,"well in short
this comes under my top 5 worst marvel movie
my god   nothing interesting in this movie  not even the final battle😑
there's like no suspense at all
and the main characters going to learn everything in like minutes  no need of training  just be main character😑",Positive
1665,you keep waiting for this movie to get better and it is thoroughly disappointingly not a marvel movie nor does it get better  it ties in a marvel character  but it is pretty pathetic  mulan was 10x better and that's saying a lot  don't bother wasting your time or money watching this; especially if you're expecting it to be even remotely marvel ,Positive
1666,entertaining  great effects  costumes  humour and cast  a fan of simu's from kim's convenience so happy to see him get this monster role!! akwafina is an adorable comic ,Positive
1667,this is just bad  mummy 2 bad  lifeless empty floaty cgi   like the cgi you'd get in a computer game cut scene from 15 years ago with the actors green screened badly into shot  then there's the script and a racing poorly paced story  even if the actors were giving their all it couldn't save this    i might've rated this higher if i hadn't already had to watch black widow this year    not to mention crap like mortal kombat and snake eyes its on that level just stop marvel  take some time off think about your product and come back strong  ,Negative
1668,it was such a awesome movie!!!!!!!!! i want to thanks marvel ,Positive
1669,awful film i wish i could get my money back  waste of time just awful ,Negative
1670,it's so amazing to see more asian and female representation of films   this film is a representation of marvel's ability to adapt  adapt to different cultures  languages  race  that they are able to create new story lines  but also branch them together  i have to say  amazing cast too! i can't wait to see what else marvel has to bring out  i hope other studios take inspiration and follow suit  people enjoy different yet relatable  and this film didn't disappoint!,Positive
1671,oke i saw the suicide squat yesterday and just saw chang chi and the ten rings   this is why i love marvel so much  they know how to make something so stupid  really fantastic  what a difference! and how the story lines also come together nicely  i am proud  in addition  it is also wonderful to see japanese fighting scenes again  it was a party  thanks marvel ,Positive
1672,best movie marvel made imo and probably my best theatre experience ,Positive
1673,what it is is wushu action entering marvel universe i you like martial arts classics from asia this is a film for you  if you like action and creatures it is for you  if you like subtitles and mythology and want 2 hours of escapism go see this ,Positive
1674,marvel has finally released a movie that isn't a complete abomination action was heavy in the film  with great choreography and clear shots  the villain of the film was well put together  there was no ambiguity or salvation fluff  the chinese sequences and actors of the film were excellent  however  the american counterparts performed poorly; some viewers may find the american humour entertaining  for me  if awkwafina's character was omitted  the movie would've been an 8/10 it's a long film  but it's worth a watch if you're into martial arts and superheroes ,Positive
1675,"shang chi has a great tone  engaging characters  mostly solid action and a good script  this movie is at its best when it sets itself apart from other marvel films  and at its worst when it adheres to the formula  shang chi himself wavers between being an engaging  relatable protagonist and a boring run of the mill hero type  one thing this film excels at is storytelling through action  some of the intimate kung fu scenes are giving us a lot of information  story and emotion  most writers will emphasise the phrase ""show  don't tell""  and this film often does just that to its credit  katy is sometimes a funny and relatable character and sometimes annoying  the gags are kinda good in this movie too for me  the highlight of the film is most certainly shang chi's father  he's human  he's charismatic  he's powerful  he's kind  loving  harsh and violent i think the latter parts of the film get a little dull and by the numbers  as if they took all the things that worked about black panther and just transplanted them to an asian theme overall very different from the other mcu films  not without issues but fairly enjoyable ",Positive
1676,this movie had a solid cast and some great martial arts fight sequences  sadly  every other aspect fell short for me the characters were a mixed bag  with a good protagonist but a villain whose backstory and motivations were incredibly generic and uninteresting  the dialogue was poor: quippy jokes were made all the way through  most falling flat and being told by the main character's best friend  the worst case was a joke between the characters and a flight attendant that interrupted the telling of a tragic backstory  this is evidence enough of the film being insecure in its own storytelling; it is so afraid that a sad moment won't land that it won't even give it a chance another issue with shang chi was that it also couldn't decide on whether it wanted to be a serious martial arts film or a goofy marvel movie like 'guardians of the galaxy'  leading to the cgi stuffed second half feeling like a massive step down in quality when it lacked the charm of something like 'thor: ragnarok'  the second half was made even more disappointing by how the culture that the characters ran into had incredibly generic lore surrounding them and unfortunately the cgi looked equally rushed and generic overall  i'm disappointed that an east asian themed movie failed to deliver something unique to what we've seen previously from marvel studios  i was hoping for some captivating mythology or at least another cultural perspective  but instead just got more of the same  if you have small children and you're looking for a film they'll enjoy  then i'd recommend this  if not  i'd advise looking for something else ,Negative
1677,it honestly shocks me on how many people would give this movie a low rating  shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is one of the best films that has come out this year  this film has a lot of action  comedy and has soul  i felt very connected to this film  it's very unique and the actors performed very well  the cinematography  visuals were crafted beautifully and the music composition worked wonderfully together  a lot of hard work has been put into this film and it definitely shows  this movie deserves the rating it gets from me and i'll be seeing this again tomorrow ,Positive
1678,love the cinematography  the plot  the cast  the whole idea of this movie is amazing  100% recommend ,Positive
1679,"to be completely honest  the movie is good and enjoyable  the special effects were great  the fight scene between wenwu and li was a nice homage to older kungfu movies  the magical land of ta lo is a nice dimension for the mcu to tackle  a more family friendly fantasy at which disney has mastered  the story itself wasn't too hard to swallow and in my opinion  tony leung stole the show to the bad parts:
i feel as though most of the movie is an exposition dump  the story just has way too much aspects and the movie is barely capable to explain them  whether it be about the secret map to ta lo  the great protector or just shang chi's mom  i also think acting and casting is a bit lacking simu's character is lovable and all but does not evoke strong emotions  awkwafina's character is just wacky and 9/10 times we can see her surprised with her mouth open  not to mention her being more than able to use a bow within idk? less than a week? zhang meng'er was great and fresh! i think she did really well in this film  tony leung was a great pick  no arguments on that  michelle yeoh is good sure but i feel like i always see her in roles like this (safe but not fresh) all in all  i do respect the asian representation (i'm asian myself) but the movie does not empower  i hope hollywood would bring on more and more asian actors/actresses ",Positive
1680,"absolutely enjoyed the film from first to last     truly aa blockbuster must watch film   
at another blockbuster from marvel studios ",Positive
1681,the first half of the movie  where humans talk to each other and their is some kind of plot is good  the second half and especially the final 30 minute battle is dull and useless  do i really want to see 2 cgi dragons fighting? or more of the same chaotic cgi battles where no amount of damage or punishment does much of anything? time for the writers and directors to do better  maybe the first few years this was good  i'm tired of watching what are essentially video game battles ,Positive
1682,the mcu has definitely reached its highest level as far as special effects are concerned  a really good job ,Positive
1683,"well it's 9 5
this movie is deserved to be watched at theaters
action 11/10
emotion 9/10
story 10/10
the only flaw in this movie is it is little bit fast paced ",Positive
1684,the actors and choreographers are overshadowed by an incredibly poor script too many things are cliched  rushed or just generally bad i found myself cringing at many parts in this film what could have been a fantastic story of a son & daughter having to overcome the misguided grief of their father became a film full of misjudged moments  undeveloped characters and a cgi mess ,Negative
1685,this movie is awesome  i can't say one bad thing about it  the choreography is good  the writing is good  the antagonist is good  everything is good!,Positive
1686,the fight scenes were slow  the cinematography was weak  a wasted chance of making an origin story really good but crappy decisions were made and it felt drowned out ,Negative
1687,this is the best marvel film i have seen besides endgame  it bring a whole new feeling to the mcu and it pays off tenfold  not much else to say ,Positive
1688,one of the best marvel superhero origin movies  great kungfu element with stunning portray  a great opening with the ten ring history and fantastic martial art scene  the castings are great  a great viewing experience that touches on friendship  family  and of course marvels universe ,Positive
1689,this film had some very funny and unique moments in it  but overall i think the story was quite weak and there weren't any moments where i was fully into the movie  i think sequels could have good potential but i left the cinema without much excitement  don't get me wrong it's a good movie but there are so many marvel films that top this one in storyline and character developed ect  i think 6 is a reasonable score i would give 6 5 if this were an option but 7 is a bit generous  don't believe these 10/10 reviews  10 is reserved for cinematic masterpieces like the dark night or infinity war ,Positive
1690,this movie was so great! the cinematography  choreography  plot   it could not have been done better  marvel hasn't made such a masterpiece since black panther ,Positive
1691,brilliant & beautiful movie   best action scenes   best super hero movie of the year   good tail end   loved it  ,Positive
1692,well  marvel's phase 4 has started with an asian superhero  the introducing was good & also the first act but then  it got slower  things seemed like mess  i'm talking about the storytelling  it could be so much better but you have to admit that actions were so fantastic as every marvel films  unique and spectacular sci fi actions  you can see clashing armies & big water bender dragons  this is all the movie has to show us  a misguided father & a mother who looks like raya from disney so much marshal arts  destruction etc acting wasn't so good  you can see it totally that they gave their full efforts for the action scenes for me  as usual marvel movie & i don't think i'm gonna watch this movie again in theatre 'cause it isn't worth that much ,Positive
1693,honestly its good movie  but it is not the best one   i expected much but it not full fill my expectations  there is not any twists  one time watchable movie thats all ,Positive
1694,the action scenes are cool  awkwafina and ben kingsley were funny  and there's some great cgi  everything else about the movie was mediocre  at best ,Positive
1695,a marmite film!generic kung fu movie with a poor plot  when ben kingsley and the hundun came in i groaned     and shortly after  with an hour to run  walked out and went to the pub!yes some great visuals and fight scenes  but not for me    ,Positive
1696,hands down the best marvel movie they've made  this movie was perfect in every way  flow  casting  comedy  action  drama  cgi  story    literally everything was perfect the amount of emotional investment in the characters was was deep! it was just the best movie i've seen in such a long time!,Positive
1697,brad allan is great chinese culture is not as complicated as everyone thinks now everyone knows who's really confident i could almost say that this movie is an iq test  and you can see a lot of things through it  some people get good grades  while others get only a failing grade although many people are criticizing american movies  we all know that this is just a comparison with the past  globally  there are still very few challengers  minus one point in the hope that it will continue to improve  not that there is anything wrong with it ,Positive
1698,brad allan is great chinese culture is not as complicated as everyone thinks everyone knows who's really confident i could almost say that this movie is an iq test  and you can see a lot of things through it  some people get good grades  while others get only a failing grade ,Positive
1699,now one of my marvel favs (as a fan since the beginning!)  this movie is so beautifully written  the storyline is original and creative  and the acting is impeccable  another phase 4 hit!!!,Positive
1700,this film is full of surprises  and really perfect ,Positive
1701,this movie is perfect in many ways  it makes you want to see it again and again  the action and cgi are perfect  the actors too  the only problem with that movie is that i felt like the dragon part was unnecessary  other than that  the movie is perfect ,Positive
1702,so much backstory and exposition needed to cover way too much fantasy gubbins in the script  awful cgi  every scene has flat lighting and flat staging that make the characters look pasted into the surface  there are a few great scenes in the first half of the movie actually shot on location or sets with augmented effects  which kind of gave a feel of what it might've been  and a few moments where the actors are allowed to perform in a real location and their performances seem to have some anchor  otherwise it felt a total mess ,Positive
1703,this is hands down movie of the year  do yourself a favor and go see this on the big screen! this is one of those movies there in 20 years you'll say i seen that on the big screen!,Negative
1704,with a great list of successful movies  marvels has created bigger expectations  as always   good movie  eagerly waiting for part 2 🙃,Positive
1705,it's fun to see actors from other movies  grand master and crouching tiger hidden dragon ,Positive
1706,it started out well  the boy in the san francisco at the bus  but as it went on to the rescue of the mother it got boring  i expected more from marvel ,Negative
1707,it's better than the snyder's cut  the sucide squad the nolan's trilogy and anything dc would put out in the nearest future proves the marvel universe can truly explore other genre like kung fu/martial arts thanks to this movie we successful introduced that genre into the mcu along with spy thrillers like winter soldier and black widow  while dc is still recycling batman and superman and the rest of their generic characters (🤣🤣 fans of generic characters calling the movie generic) next etarnals cry harder ,Positive
1708,marvel did it again  the formula is there  the action  the drama  the comedy  the well done cgi  its a marvel movie  what else do you expect  its a good movie  but for me tony leung as wen wu overshadowed simu liu as shang chi  leung is a great actor  knew him since infernal affair  he brought the character of wen wu as best as no one else could  even when he stood without a dialogue you can feel his charisma     i'd go see the this again just to watch wen wu   simu liu has a long way ahead of him to be a better actor  but this one is ok  go see it with your family  its fun ,Positive
1709,movie was amazing!! the best movie in mcu  better than endgame  jorge es mierda ,Positive
1710,this movie sucks  just like jorge la mierda  but is better than iron man 3 ,Positive
1711,enjoyed every action scene  must watch in big screens ,Positive
1712,"it can't be really better
action scenes and emotional scenes were awsome
made me cry and wow how fantastic the movie was
one of the best movies of marvel all the time
waiting for second movie ",Positive
1713,i laughed  i even cried a little bit  i bit my nails and was all over the living room fantastic  it has martial arts  good punchlines  charismatic main characters and just pure awesome marvelness i wish i had amnesia so i could wake up tomorrow and just watch it all over again with same excitement ,Positive
1714,definitely worth the ticket! great action and fight plots ,Positive
1715,this movie 'almost' breaks the mold of being yet another super hero movie  it really rides the line of being a movie to finally genre break a movie in the mcu  it genuinely felt like a proper kung fu movie with excellent choreography and legitimate fighting styles and some plot tropes of the older kung fu films  it even manages some chi bending stuff  i really thought this would be a boring injection of a new character  but as a fan of old kung fu movies i thoroughly enjoyed this one and it gives me some hope that the mcu can get a little more risky with stepping out side the super hero genre within the same universe ,Positive
1716,i dont know how to describe  the movie is okay but i prefer the native accent not english  the madarin would be a much better choice than english  and the main lead is not okay at all ,Positive
1717,despite maintaining some of marvels signature (and sometimes tedious) tropes  shang chi shines through as one of my favourite mcu films of all time! the action was simply put   epic  this movie had some truly awesome moments  a fantastic debut for these characters  shang chi grabs some of the best parts of chinese martial arts cinema and marvelises them while making it work  going in to this movie i honestly expected to dislike it given how predictable marvels films have gotten and generally suffering from marvel bloat but shang chi surpassed my expectations and gave me two hours of awesomeness  side note: the only thing that would've made this movie better is less of the marvel quips and cheese ,Positive
1718,found myself skipping scenes as the story plot was not interesting  to be honest  it was the abomination scene that had me interested in watching the movie  if you saw the trailer you saw the scene  nothing extra ,Positive
1719,i like marvel try out some new characters into the marvel universe and overall just a great movie ,Positive
1720,shang chi is a great movie  it features some of the best action sequences since the winter soldier  the actors clearly trained hard and didn't just practice boxing like most action movies do  the story has some weak points but overall  i really enjoyed this movie and give it an 8/10 ,Positive
1721,"positive
 great casting (simu liu  tony lueng)  especially tony lueng because he look badass and has
great acting skill  you've already heard people praising the film's action choreography  and it's well deserved  it
doesn't has many cut scenes like many mcu fighting scenes  this film felt completely unique from what we've seen from the mcu already  props to the beautiful cinematography and soundtrack as well  they were great! the first two act was incredible and amazing showing the life of shang chi  how wenwu meet
his wife etc  this type of act is something mcu usually doesn't have  this film open up mcu to new world with myth creature  many evil organization  and the
mystery of the ten rings negative
 the casting was stellar  aside from the one person i didn't care for (*razor fist  cough
cough*) everybody played their roles to perfection  the jokes may not be funny to some people  but it's funny to me  the only issue i had with shang chi was the third act  not that it was bad  but it felt
detracting from what the first 2/3rds of the movie established  it become every mcu logic
part(cgi battle)  it took away from the great hand to hand action stunt work  but it's to be
expected from a film of this genre the exposition can be a bit heavy but understandably needed to introduce a brand newcharacter into this universe imo
great way to introduce new hero  great martial art fight scenes  great characters  looking forward to shang chi  also wenwu not a top tier film in movie industry but a top tier film in mcu standalone movies ",Positive

1723,this movie has the best and fresh action scenes  marvel never lets you down in terms of expactations  loved it completely ,Positive
1724,i can say with full confidence that this movie had the best action sequences than all the other marvel movies combined  it was really something i never could have expected ever from a movie i know very little about  would definitely recommend this movie to watch in theatres ,Positive
1725,let me start off by saying that this film is a nice blend of spider man  and ant man  when you look at the personality and humor of the characters  but in a way  this is honestly every marvel movie in one  the visuals are reminiscent of dr strange  the humor is quite like ragnarok  and the characters and backstory is just fantastic  a great movie to watch with your family  but it's also great for marvel fans  maybe one of the best marvel superhero origin stories  the pacing is decent  and the visuals are phenomenal  and you'll be happy with all the little easter eggs and extras  this is a very fun movie  it's not too dark  and i can recommend this for every marvel fan out there  it's definitely worth the watch  you will not be to disappointed ,Positive
1726,"the cast  music  choreography and comedic relief started very strong  and then it rushed   
it feels as though the movie is split in two  taking a very different direction halfway  and it didn't do it justice ",Positive
1727,overall the movie was absolutely fantastic!best origin story to any character in the mcu the jokes were timed very well and they were pretty hilarious  the villain and hero dynamic was very interesting  the fight scenes are by far the best in any superhero movie ,Positive
1728,i thought the whole story was boring and the main characters were too  the cgi wasn't spot on and the jokes were so dull  among the worse movies in the mcu  ,Negative
1729,overall this movie exceeded my expectations  i wish i had gone to see it in theatres because visually  this movie is stunning  all the fight scenes  especially the ending would have looked even cooler on the big screen but stepping back and thinking about the actual story  it's kind of random  predictable at times and i'm not seeing how they're going to incorporate it into the rest of the mcu the other thing is the fight scenes: the choreography  the cinematography  the effects  they were great  and i think they knew that  so they took advantage of it  during the first half of the movie there would be a new fight scene every fifteen minutes that looked fantastic  but seemed to last just a bit too long all in all i liked it  the acting was pretty good  the pacing was reasonable  the soundtrack was unique and the visual effects were a strongpoint it was a good movie ,Positive
1730,this is the best movie ever oh my gosh this movie is so good if you haven't watched it you'll have to watch it immediately it's free on disney+ watch it now watch it now watch ,Positive
1731,probably one of the worst marvel movies of all time  even for fantasy this is ridiculous  the cg was decent but thats about it  probably should have just been released in china  thats who the movie was made for  disney is doing what it does best  ruining great movie studios ,Positive
1732,after two and half years gap all the audience came back together to watch a marvel movie shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is one of the most action packed and entertaining movie it does it keeps you engaged till the end of the movie the action sequences and the visual effects are top notch the costume designing and the actors you simu like awkwafina the theatres were housefull in india  this movie has a craze in india one of the best moral movies after 2 years at soft tomorrow will must watch movie only in theatres not in home ,Positive
1733,i saw all the trailers and all the press for the movie but wasn't that hyped for it if i'm being honest  then i saw the movie and i must say   expectations were blown out of the water  the movie was great and something quite unique and refreshing for the mcu  i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend ,Positive
1734,a little different from rest of the marvel movies  new cast and all  totally amazing  worth your time ,Positive
1735,this is amazing  the first time i saw it in the theater it gave me goosebumps  the action was amazingly stunning  the character was cool  definitely my favorite  can't wait to see shang chi on the mcu movies ,Positive
1736,that movie was so good that my blood celly wanted see this masterpiece on they're own and my nose started bleeding in the middle of the final fight ,Positive
1737,this movie was awesome  it felt like an entirely different experience with amazing cgi  tony leung really shone in this movie  it definitely focuses on introducing new characters unlike what people think that these solo mcu movies are just there to set up for a must see event i just don't understand why people are rating this one star when it hasn't even been released in the majority of countries  people just be hating for no reason ,Positive
1738,this movie was a huge disappointment for me  if you take out the special effects and fight choreography  it basically a b movie  it's lame  the characters are shallow  the costumes look like they just came fresh from the factory  recently marvel movies are starting to get mass produced  and you can see the drop in quality  it feels like another installment for a money making train  and not like a real movie ,Negative
1739,i really liked this movie and i'm a full on marvel fan  i usually like wanda over all the other characters  but this film makes me like shang chi now too  and all this time i would have never thought i would like another character  marvel  you have outdone yourselves for sure!,Positive
1740,shang chi is the basic marvel origin story formula  we as marvel fans kinda know the outline of these films by now  that being said the films best parts was its pacing it flowed really well and kept you as the audience really entertained and engaged in what's going on in the film  the films jokes landed well and the action in this film was better than a lot of the marvel films we have seen lately  the story of the film wasn't bad but wasn't anything super investing the best part of the movie really was the performance of the lead actors who play shang chi and katy ,Positive
1741,"this movie has everything you'd expect from a top tier marvel film  great action  great humor  great casting  great effects and a good story people less likely to enjoy this movie:
1  dc fanboys  because it's easily better than anything the dcu has put out and they just hate that 2  xenophobes  because 95% of the cast is asian (obviously)3  chauvinists  because it has several strong female characters4  maga  see 2&35  comic book purists  because the characters and storylines don't follow the comic books to the extent they insist it should if you don't fall into any of these categories  you should really enjoy this film ",Positive
1742,"wow! this movie wasn't bad at all    the action fight scene was a mixture of classical chinese martial arts choreography as flying & floating around as some 1970s classic chinese kung fu movies like hidden dragon  crounching tiger & jet li's once upon a time in china with also realistic fighting style as well as jackie chan fighting style with a mixture of fantasy magic power of fighting style like ""dragon ball z"" lol  the romance scene was soo beautiful with both shang chi mother & father a better romance movie than other marvel superhero movie lol  the landscapes & background graphics were so amazing well done! it is soo enjoying to see a beautiful landscapes of grass  trees  & with chinese mythology creatures  the funny scene was really enjoyable to watch with mostly katy !! shang chi close friend lol  the storyline was 4 main character was shang chi  xialing  wenwu  & jiang li  it was a very well done well written story line plot of these 4 main characters by showing flashbacks to the past of what had happened to these 4 characters  the script was well done some had some serious scripts as wenwu xialing & shang chi but only 2 has the funny scripts as katy & trevor slattery! lmao  2 villains that work for wenwu was very well done made with their own job to do which was razor fist & death dealer    the most sad drama part was shang chi father being stuck in the past with his wife that died long ago  its was heart felt as heart broken    : (the 2 big reason why i gave this movie a (9 out of 10!) it is because 1! i wish the movie shows how shang chi father wenwu! how he found the 10 rings of power as in the marvels comic book!!! in the comic book the story of shang chi father founded the 10 rings in a landing crashed alien space ship across china thousands of years ago that crashed into a village mountain in china & 2! i wish marvel show the history of the 10 rings criminal organization as a flashback in iron man 1 to iron man 3    ",Positive
1743,the plot of shang chi is extremely entertaining with twists and turns  the world building is spectacular  the characters are extremely well written with depth unlike most marvel movies  a must watch for marvel fans ,Positive
1744,i can't understand why people are rating this 10 /10  it's ok  good special effects and fight scene's but story and the supposed laughs just didn't work for me  go and see free guy for a 10 /10 film ,Positive
1745,the visuals in this movie are top notch  there is a new world to explore  good acting  perfect cast  if you are a marvel fan  go watch this!!,Positive
1746,this movie was amazing  goes straight to my favourite movie list  it had an amazing story line  great acting  mesmerising cinematography and good humour  it had some spectacular fight scenes  i would definitely recommend this movie to everyone!!! it's a must see ,Positive
1747,this movie completely blew me away! from the expression of chinese culture to beautiful cinematography and a great plot  shang chi has made it to my top 5 marvel movies list  i loved that this movie has inspired so many young east asian and asian american children because they can finally see someone who looks like them as a superhero  beautiful i'm really looking forward to eternals next as marvel carries on including people of all ethnicities  genders  and sexual identities:),Positive
1748,"plot is very poor  acting matches the plot   
some nice visual effects but all in all a total waste of time wish i could get my 2 hours back but here we are   oh and awfulfina acting  appereance and  well everything is the icing on this cake made of cr  p ",Negative
1749,this movie is worth watching  marvel has a funny way of connecting the storylines of other mcu films  the fight choreography and cgi is above standards and the story line is superb! amazing film ,Positive
1750,mcu new characters are always astonishing  looking ahead for timely updates ,Positive
1751,it's better than expectations  tony is a really good actor  it consists of many asian elements which makes the movie more interesting ,Positive
1752,overall a good movie  the plot falls more on the cliché side  but is still interesting no doubt  loved the use of culture  also loved the fact that the main protagonists were written to have relatable personalities which allowed for more humorous moments  one thing i didn't particularly like was the use of the mythical creatures  throughout the whole movie  shang chi's father was pinned as the bad guy  once the father was defeated  it already felt like an ending but the magical creatures appeared and it somehow turned into shang chi's ultimate fight ,Positive
1753,this was fantastic  saw it in theaters then again as soon as it was out on streaming too! the story and characters were great to explore; the action sequences and special effects keep you immersed; and the actors all made the story come to life ,Positive
1754,the fight scenes are lit  i got that adrenaline feeling you get from watching films like john wick for about 70% of this film  the choreography was very impressive and it gave me a crouching tiger  hidden dragon kinda vibe at times (watch the movie and you'll know what i mean) as far as the story  it sets up the next chapter of the mcu very nicely  that's all i will say #nospoilers ,Positive
1755,i'm a marvel huge fan and unfortunately i could not watch black widow in theaters so right after it came out i went to watch shang chi  what can i say  i got out from the cinema very excited at first but still kind of disappointed  it looks like a disney live action more than a marvel movie    i have nothing to say about the special effects and combat scenes though  those were amazing anyways  i can't say i wasted my money because it's still a nice movie  but i know that some people might not like it because it doesn't even seem to be a marvel movie ,Positive
1756,the imagery in the film is unique for marvel and beautiful  but the plot leaves much to be desired  shang chi's father and sister are probably the best developed characters  but i hope future movies will develop awkwafina's character more because she is hilarious ,Positive
1757,after cap  america winter soldier  civil war  avengers  this has to be at the top list  loved it  simu liu is an amazing actor n the cast was top notch ,Positive
1758,best cgi  and must watch movie  with top notch vfx  loved the movie so much ,Positive
1759,one of the best marvel movies so far we really need part tow  i really liked the characters and they was written so well ,Positive
1760,"growing up as a kid on kung fu movies  went into shang chi with opened mind well  it blown me away  the cast were outstanding  the visual effects  cinematography  vibrant colours  the fight scenes are fantastic and enjoyed the music as well found myself laughing at time  exited and emotional mcu have added more characters  diversity and new possibilities shang chi and the legend of the ten rings
was spectacular movie to watch ",Positive
1761,too much good movie in pandemic  surprise for all movie lovers ,Positive
1762,beautiful from start to finish  amazing visuals  cgi and fight scenes  acting was incredible  tony leung was so compelling as a villain  and so refreshingly funny too best marvel origin story yet ,Positive
1763,it's simply too generic and jokes don't land at all  not recommending  maybe wait for streaming ,Neutral
1764,what a movie   hands down brilliant   thank you marvel for giving us such a new world   excellent from everyone   simu liu is just a star and long way to go   best choice for the role ,Positive
1765,rotten tomatoes makes it seem like it's on same level with spider man 2 or the dark knight  but it's not even close to same level  it's most basic mcu origin story possible  what's the point of these scores when one movie is masterpiece (spider man 2) and another is super mediocre (shang schi)  but both have same rotten tomatoes score  it makes no sense ,Positive
1766,i didn't know anything about the film before going to see it  i thought it would be like dr strange (it wasn't)  beautiful visuals  brilliant action scenes and i was interested in the film the whole time!,Positive
1767,i watched best movie by marvel its full cocktail with action   drama   emotion   comedy special thanks for pina and sir ben  k tony sir and the actor who ply shangchi whol cast are superb in their role they did great work and last epic dragon vs dragon fight was great unfortunately there are no open theater in my state so i watched it in my lptop but great experience ,Positive
1768,"i have to give credit to the first ""real"" fight scene  it's really good  and looks like it was a lot of fun to film  i'd pay just to watch it but then you can leave  everything else is really bad  especially the power scaling  the main plot devise is a weapon that is inferior to a gun  seriously  then theres the plot hole of ""where's all the guns"" no one has guns? yea it's a marshal arts film but john wick was too  then it's not like marvel can just buff this character  the only way  would be to make him move faster but no way can a human move faster than quicksilver  and quicksilver couldn't put run a bullet  the only other way to buff him is if they just gave him a gun in combination and the rings would be used for mobility and support but it's not some power weapon and even if he did have a gun he doesn't even scale to war machine because war machine is bullet proof ",Positive
1769,the vfx and cgi of this movies were both great and the best in a debut movie in my point of view  the action scenes were so good even my father who didn't wanted to see the movie loved it and the movie is purely family friendly overall i really liked the movie  it made a lot of new fans of the mcu community ,Positive
1770,"yeah   this is the movie where you find something different from marvel  new concept  new storyline  new character and new type of super power
but wait    2 stars for that
story line is weack  you gonna disappointed with story  that's why i reduced 2 stars the directions and visual efects and the fight sequences and all action is just another level  that's why i give 2 stars
acting  you can't find mistakes  all actors na and actres done their job very well  1 star for that most important thing in marvel is emotions  we know marvel characters are fictional but we emotionally attached with them  but in this movie  you don't feel any emotion  that's why i reduce 1 star and the last  1 star for being a marvel fan  ",Positive
1771,yeah  in the history of marvel no other movie is like shang chi        new concept and new characters and new type of story  that's why i give 2 star but wait  you gonna disappointe with storyline  like  story can't attach us like other marvel movie  i gonna reduce 2 star for it but wait  don't worry  the action scene  visual efects  direction is just awesome      too good  thats why i give 2 stars acting  you can't find a single mistake in acting  all of them done their job very well  that's why i will give more 2 stars the most important thing is emotion  we all know marvel characters are fictional  but we all know how much we have emotional attachment to them  but in this movie this is a weack point  you can't get emotionally attached with the character easily  1 star is reduce bcz of it and 1 star added for bieng a marvel fan ,Positive
1772,i had very high expectations and shang chi still blew me away  definitely the best marvel movie to date  the story was great  the villain wasn't boring and didn't have lame motives  the characters were well written  the music was fantastic and the fight scenes and special effects were amazing  it's also a very easy movie to understand and enjoy if you aren't very well versed in marvel movies as it's shang chi's introductory movie  highly recommend ,Positive
1773,it's an awesome movie and the best superhero movie of this year till now  i liked it ,Positive
1774,best movie of the year 2021 and i will say this is a must watch movie  best one 👍,Positive
1775,very predictable movie  not that great as the review and ratings shows ,Positive
1776,this movie had amazing visuals  awesome fight scenes  and great and lovable characters  all in all this movie is very enjoyable and should be experienced on the big screen ,Positive
1777,when watching shang  chi you will almost immediately see that it follows the same formula as every other marvel movie  but there is one thing that this movie excels at and that is the choreography  the choreography is some of the best seen in the the marvel universe and maybe even in cinema in general  the character of shang  chi (played by simu liu) is a great addition to the mcu  but i can not say the same for some of the other characters in the movie especially the character katy (played by awkwafina)  the character is very flat and childish making her almost annoying though i believe that this is the fault of the writers and not awkwafina  another aspect of this movie that i like is the cameos  while i will not mention them to avoid spoilers  i will say that they are definitely one of my favorite parts of not only this movie but of the mcu in general  all in all i give shang chi a 9 out of 10  great movie ,Positive
1778,i see this as fresh for marvel  background score is good and character design could have improved a bit  if you compare this with dc's aquaman  still aquaman wins ,Positive
1779,so you want your son to come see you and your plan is to send a team of assassins to kill/collect him? you might lose your son  lose some henchman  and reveal your organization on the internet  this is the first action sequence and one of the first overall scenes of the movie; the poor writing sets a bad tone for the rest of the movie  your defense is you don't think your assassins could kill him; but your goons had the element of surprise and you haven't seen your son in 10 years so how could you know if he's gone soft or not  main actor performance: c; best friend performance: d; sister performance: c; dad: c  the aunt's performance was an a; but maybe i'm biased because i loved her in crouching tiger ,Negative
1780,this movie is the best movie of all time  i've seen these reviews saying that the fighting is terrible and that the story is hard to follow but none of that is true the fights scenes where intense and the story was a work of art i can't wait to see what marvel do next with the eternals or any future production's  this is a 10/10 movie no matter what anyone says ,Positive
1781,a marvel movie that you should not miss a lot of action followed by a sad story between father and son ,Negative
1782,i liked it as an mcu movie  and i am super excited to see what comes next  bit my only problem js some of the jokes don't land and it feels a bit long at some parts  but the emotional beats are beautiful  good movie  if you like action go watch it ,Positive
1783,this movie will enter my top 5 best movies! the cgi was so good that my mouth opened widely after watched this movie ,Positive
1784,the movie was fine; it had some good moments and a somewhat interesting plot  but mostly a bad action/sitcom mash up with weak characters  disingenuous emotional moments  and consistently frustrating decision making worth it for big marvel fans  if not  i'd skip it ,Positive
1785,i thought this movie was ok it wasn't bad at all but it was definitely not the best mcu movie  i really liked the martial arts fighting in the movie and i thought shang chi where a nice character now there where 30 minutes of this movie that we're really slow and i didn't like that  i would personally give it a 4 out of 10 stars ,Positive
1786,how on earth has this got a higher rating than no time to die??bad script filled with the typical disney cliche characters and fluffy toys that can be sold on to much dodgy green screen and awful cgi terrible terrible mess of a film 3/10 ,Negative
1787,finally a hero from asia  it's a perfect movie for me so far because the fight scenes and the visualization are beautifully shown  there are also some unpredictable stories that made me amazed  this is the best movie i have ever watched in cinema so far  waiting for next shang chi movie!,Positive
1788,"disappointing but still enjoyable in short  we were shown some pretty big cameos and things in the trailer that the movie offered little more  a whole underground fighting ring barely explored or explained  really nice choreographed fight scenes ruined by over the top cgi explosions  at one point i thought i was watching a transformers sequel  worse part was probably the fact they shoehorned mcu links and used too much convenient plot devices  such as ""how do we get to this impossible to find place?"" ""easy  barely an inconvenience we'll just put them in the exact place with guy with a magic sat nav and we can use a bmw to get some ad money boi""felt too predictable and lazy that said  fights were enjoyable in the first half  and i saw a dragon so just above average 6/10 ",Positive
1789,this is my new favorite marvel  everything was perfect from acting to storyline  only problem  that actor ben kingsley didn't belong in there  otherwise it's 10/10 two thumbs up ,Positive
1790,it was horrible  first of all  the official trailer presented the film in a completely different way  the scenes looked artificial  what bothered me the most were the characters who didn't have to be there at all and didn't fit in there  a completely illogical story    the worst marvel game i've ever seen ,Negative
1791,the storyline is predictable  there was nothing innovative or creative in the story the visual effects were very good but again nothing out of the ordinary based on similar such movies you can watch it for one time but nothing to leave you impressed the actors have done a great job but they were not backed by an engaging storyline ,Positive
1792,i don't get the positivity around this trash  right from the word go  something was wrong  it drags on with a ridiculous plot which is a mish mash from other movies and ends in a ludicrous cgi battle and everyone goes awww and gave it 7 5 rating on imdb     i just don't get it shang chi actor has no acting skills  no range of emotions  no appeal  and no screen presence  he is just there waving his hands and legs  wearing a plot armorshang chi's lady friend awkwafina is annoying as hell  her voice screeches  and they don't have any chemistry  what are they supposed to be? friends? or bf and gf?the bus sequence is ripped off from the movie speed  the story where awkwafina suddenly acquires archer skills is ripped off from dragonheart  i am sure there are more  so what is it but a mish mash of ripped off ideas from other moviesshang chi's sister xialing is irritating to watch  her hair is dead black without any crease?? it's clearly a wig for crying out loud!! and she is thin to the bones and she can fight kung fu? who the they kidding?the villains are dumb as hell too  shang chi's father after having lived for an eternity has aged just enough to be shang chi's father age  i e 50s  why couldn't he have been 24? and with all the experience he cannot figure out the spell he was under and all the villains strike our protagonists head  i am screaming in my chair that    there is something called a chest and belly  just lower your hands and punch the guts and our hero is out  but no    they need to act as dumb as they look and oh    that chinese wakanda  god it's a disgrace  the cgi  the animal design and the world design is utterly terrible  the world is too green and pulls you out of immersion  when ever the characters are walking in front of the green vegetation behind them  their head and the hairs gets blurry  highlighting the failure of the cgi when they tried to remove the green screen martial arts is nothing but punching the air and hand waviness  just watch kung fu panda 1 and crouching tiger hidden dragonthe final boss fight is just cgi non sense i can go on and on but let me close on just one question what is shang chi's powers? he's got none  until he gets those bracelets  so how can he take all the beating and still be in one piece? and all those skills on dragon surfing etc i have to admit  if i have worn the fanboy glasses and kept my brain in the freezer i would have certainly liked it  but i did the opposite and see what happens : (,Negative
1793,i am a die hard fan of everything marital arts  shang chi is one of my favorite comic characters  i really had hopes from this movie  not high hopes but hopes  however it is a complete disappointment  poor acting  predictable plot  full of clichés i'd rather watch something on youtube for free ,Positive
1794,the main conflict of this film begins when xu shang chi has been trained to be an assassin by his father  xu wenwu (tony leung)  since he was a child  then  when he was 14  he was ordered to commit his first murder  however  he later took advantage of this to leave his father and younger sister to start a life like ordinary people i love this movie  hope part 2 will come soon  tony leung is my favorite taiwanese actor ,Positive
1795,it starts really good  the main characters is good casted  slow moments aside  the story was not too predictable  and now  the woke part: ben kikgley's role was misfitted  really not necassary to fil it in like this ,Positive
1796,movie is fantastic and looking forward  they have sequentially arranged it which create more enthusiasm for viewers to watch movie and its type of attraction which hold viewers till last scene ,Positive
1797,after a long time finally marvel a very masterpiece of of mcu     but i have only one issue that is no introduction of ten rings in movie what is ten rings   power of ten rings noy a single hint was there   but this is the one of the best marvel movie summary: one marterpiece ,Positive
1798,after a long time finally marvel a very masterpiece of of mcu     but i have only one issue that is no introduction of ten rings in movie what is ten rings   power of ten rings noy a single hint was there   but this is the one of the best marvel movie ,Positive
1799,i really enjoyed this movie  the fantasy elements were well placed  the comedy was well timed and the fight scenes were really fun to watch  even the villain make some sense ,Positive
1800,this was a cool movie  didn't feel like a typical marvel movie but had lots of over the top action and plenty of influences from other great martial arts movies  its moves along at a good rate  lots of time hop from past to present  hopefully they don't jump the shark in the next one ,Positive
1801,i've always been an avid superhero fan but these phase 4 movies are just being more of the same  i got excited with all the good reviews and expected a breathtaking asian culture movie and got a formulaic boring origin story  the movie had great visuals but you could already tell how to story was going to unfold  all hero cliches with a story cliche plus boring soundtrack   i hope marvel gets their act together and start doing some good movies  at least for me a 21 year old honduran this was as boring as my experience with black widow  i hope eternals has some new stuff to experience and i am looking forward to spiderman no way home  saying that this was a disappointment ,Positive
1802,it ia one of the best movie on 2021  with great story and vfx  all the characters are perfrom their character like realistic  and the last fight scene was so cool ans full of goosebumps ,Positive
1803,the story of shang chi was amazing loved it and the end credits every scene was really good i liked how wong was in it and literally half the movie there were action and was really funny ,Positive
1804,i thought it might be bad as typically asian movies are made with too much stereotypes but this movie was spot on action  fantasy  adventure  amazing fighting and vivid costumes and visual effects  keep an open mind and give this a try nowwww ,Positive
1805,"the pros to this movie are definitely representing the asian community with very entertaining martial arts fighting scenes  and the great visuals  although  several of the creatures in the sort of mythical land resemble pokemon too closely  the setting there is really beautiful the cons are definitely the writing and marvel trying to cater to gen z with jokes that don't land and the two leads (shang chi & katy) falling flat  i'll admit shang chi grew on me as it went on  but katy was unbearable start to finish and easily dropped this rating because of it  awkwafina did not fit this movie at all and was doing far too much to try to be this ""relatable laid back gen z"" personality to the film although the inclusion didnt make much sense  i found myself really liking the mandarin and his pet morris  as nice comedic relief  in the way that katy tried to be ",Positive
1806,the best marvel movie i've ever seen! i went to the cinema to see this movie  i'm sorry  because the movie is marvel and i've been a fan of them since childhood  there were no expectations from the film  perhaps this played a big plus in his assessment  the plot of the film makes you think from the first minutes  it shows how it all began  true love is shown  relationships and a certain mythical world are shown  this is exactly what you constantly expect from a film of this universe  and after watching a desire to watch the film further  to find out how everything will develop further  in general  i received a lot of positive emotions from the film and this is what i will be waiting for as a continuation and further ,Positive
1807,for the marvel cinematic universe  which entered its fourth phase with great difficulty   the difficult parting with the avengers and coronavirus transfers affected   shang chi will definitely not be a support project  unless in the chinese market  for which the film is designed  and viewers who are not fans of comics may not have heard of this hero at all  in addition  director destin daniel cretton  although he has established himself as a director of good award winning dramas and biopics with brie larson (she will also appear here  in the post credits scene)  had no experience in filming action scenes  which are usually a lot in marvel films  in general  the introductory for the studio  from a commercial and artistic point of view  is not the most favorable the more surprising is the final result  shang chi is both like the very first marvel origins and more recent and mature films like black panther and doctor strange  only without the heaps of mcu lore and pressing issues  in the first act  as is usually the case  viewers and loved ones of shang chi will suddenly discover his fighting skills in a beautiful action scene on the bus  with the help of which cretton will instantly prove his genre viability ,Positive
1808,'shang chi and the legend of the ten rings (2021)' is  essentially  exactly what you expect it to be  not only does it feel like a marvel movie  it feels like a literal disney movie as well  this is often detrimental to the overall affair  as the piece should have been much more unique than it ultimately is  and it makes for a much less interesting watch overall  however  the formula it follows has provided plenty of success in the past; this time is no exception  its highs are where you'd expect them to be  as are its lows  and there is an undeniable sense of fun  albeit cookie cutter fun  to be had  the film is an entertaining action adventure that follows a young man whose criminal father calls him and his sister back home in order to lay siege to the mystical village he believes is holding his wife  the protagonist's mother  hostage  the villain's motivation is a little underexplored yet entirely understandable  it comes from a believable emotional place and is more satisfying because of it  the relationship between the lead and his no good dad isn't explored as much as it could be  though  and the flick generally has a bit of a theming issue  the piece tries to tie its events directly into the wants and needs of its lead characters  but it does so in an unsatisfyingly half baked way and honestly would probably have been better if it played itself as more of a straightforward adventure ala most of the 'mission: impossible (1996 )' series  still  the touches of character development are appreciated and each lead player is written to be as likeable as possible  this  combined with the amicable performances  means that you care about the heroes even though you don't have all that much reason to  this keeps you invested in their stories throughout  the highlight of the entire affair is  for sure  its action  for the most part  the picture stays towards the right end of the practical to cg spectrum  the fights are never exactly realistic  per se  but they're based on competent choreography and clean camerawork  they're  more often than not  really entertaining  sadly  the flick inches closer and closer towards the wrong end of the aforementioned spectrum the longer it goes on  by the time it reaches its finale (which gives me major 'fast and furious presents hobbs and shaw (2019)' vibes for some reason)  it's clear that the balance it previously achieved is going to go out of the window  sure enough  its climactic battle is an entirely computer generated affair; it isn't all that compelling and goes directly against what made the movie so enjoyable to begin with  no matter how hard it tries to disguise it  it still ends with a big blue beam in the sky  still  the finale isn't exactly bad  it's just annoyingly intangible and feels a little forced in  even (as do the rather cringe worthy post credits scenes)  ultimately  this is a generic yet entertaining experience  its charming acting and exciting action are clearly its highlights  and its weakest aspects are still decent enough  it's a good movie  however  i can't deny that marvel fatigue is becoming more and more pertinent in my mind  you know what you're going to get before you get it  plus  the studio's insistence that it has to perforate every single outing with references to other  almost entirely irrelevant fare is really annoying  although most of their movies are at least okay  i find myself not caring at all about them  that's sad  really  considering that the mcu has produced some genuinely great pictures in the past  7/10 ,Positive
1809,i was pleasantly surprised by the movie's good mix of emotions  action scenes  and light humour the main characters had quite a depth to them  shang chi himself  having strayed so much from his family at the very start of the movie  had deep reasons for doing so  a similar depth is seen for the other main characters good and bad is not so clear cut  it's impressive to see a mild version of that confusion displayed in this movie  just enough to titillate the viewer ,Positive
1810,this movie was very engaging to me  the fight scenes were very impressive  the actor simu liu who played shang chi made this character very heroic and masculine especially in the bus fight scene  the fighting between shang chi's father and mother when they first met was carried out very beautifully using different types of material arts  it was a visual feast ,Positive
1811,it was worth watching and was so fast paced  they need to make the sequel with better story line  shang chi and his friend was truely amazing  the cgi was astonishing and charismatic ,Positive
1812,compared to other mc movies this one is ok  it is hard to come up with so many heroic stories  super powers  and scripts  so with that in mind it is still a good movie  it was good to watch with family as well  starting of the movie was little different and waiting to see how it connects to entire movie as it happens was interesting ,Positive
1813,this movie was so predictable and boring  generic everything but i will admit the fight scenes and soundtrack were decent  still doesn't make up for wasting my time ,Negative
1814,i didn't hold out a lot of hope from seeing the trailers but still gave it a chance anyway  after seeing it i wish i hadn't  just another marvel trash film  that completely misses the point of the characters  the ten rings are reduced to being some king of crappy energy whip things and the cast as stale and uninteresting  marvel is really killing the artistic side of cinema ,Positive
1815,saw this on opening night and it was soooo worth it! amazing fighting sequences and choreography  amazing cinematography  amazing acting (especially by legendary tony leung)  and the storyline is interesting and moving  lots of lol moments and surprise guest appearances  i rarely pay the $15 to see a movie in the theater but this one i will do again!,Positive
1816,as a chinese american   i loved this film  they literally hit every thing spot on  i cannot think of anything else they could've done to make it better  tony leung is without a doubt tom cruise + tom hanks in the chinese/hong kong movie community  i grew up watching his films  he was a perfect cast  the use of mandarin (chinese) in this film was spot on as well  though the translation could be better  i understand chinese mandarin  and it was spot on  only thing i ask of marvel/disney is somehow bring tony leung back  and maybe help the general public on how to properly pronounce shang chi  (sh on chi)  seriously  this movie was just like black panther  everything was spot on  i've seen this movie twice in theaters  and bought 4k collectors edition  marvel/disney  please continue to take my money  thank you for creating amazing content and do justice to the chinese & chinese american & chinese abroad justice ,Positive
1817,whoever picked super bad hiphop/rap for this movie should leave the industry there are som great hiphop/rap that could haver worked a lot better if you had to pick that kind of music for this movie the asian scores obviously worked like they should anyway movie had some nice moments thought all main asian female leads did a solid job simu liu didnt work for me as the main dude  a bit of meh  with decent action scenes and solid humour scenes i gave it a 6 ,Positive
1818,it was a deluge of ott  you could miss it and live a totally fulfilling life ,Positive
1819,"what is the purpose of having ben kingsley performing as mandarin? ironman tony stark is dead  i never liked mandarin in the ironman installments since it reminds me of the insulting chinese evil character fu man chu so why here in shang chi  the character adds absolutely nothing to the movie plot line nor character development!and wong allowed to compete in an martial
arts competition? seruously?",Negative
1820,it's most annoying movie ever made from the marvel  all the character looks like immature and acting are looks like just forcing you to smile or feel amazed  i am giving this movie 1 star  doesn't like it at all ,Negative
1821,another marvel movie that is worth watching and  if possible  in a movie theater  before feige and marvel presented this future film project  i did not know anything about this character or the entire universe around him  that is why  when i was coming through the movie theater  my expectations wasn´t high at all and the truth is at the end i felt so happy and wanting to follow more adventures of this new character that marvel has given us  this movie goes through many genres  truth be told  fantasy  science fiction  comedy  drama  action and a lot of sense of adventure during the slightly more than two and a quarter hours of footage  great action and fight scenes  marvelous set pieces  very well choreographed ,Positive
1822,good kung fu coupled with good plot  turned out to be very entertaining ,Positive
1823,i can begin to describe how awesome this movie was  welcome to the marvel universe shang chi  this is one movie that is action packed  funny and great story and character build up ,Positive
1824,the physical raw fighting sequences alone turns you into a giddy kid glued to the screen hyper focused to not miss a single beat  consensus: you will miss almost all beats cos the fighting is that fast and you wont be able to catch them all even if you could pause and rewind i miss these type of movies focusing more on the physical aspect of fighting turning it into an art form  and more of a struggle to force the character to master the skill in perfection before attempting to use it  the result of failure in physical fights are more deadly and the stakes are higher surprisingly  this move had a lot of soul i missed from other older similar movies and a rich landscape of interesting characters and creatures  this movie also had a splendid cast attached with some bad ass women who got to fight a fair amount themselves which i loved  great watch  can't wait to watch it a couple of more times so i can catch some of the fighting beats i missed ,Positive
1825,don't get me wrong i liked the movie  but i may have put too much expectation into it  a lot of bad reviews have said the story was lacking  but i think the direction was lacking  the opening montage was a missed opportunity to highlight some history and maybe add some emotion  i mean disney was able to make you laugh and cry all in one up montage  tony leung really lit up the screen  i kinda wish simu lui spent a little more time refining his kung fu moves  i'm nitpicking  but he was a bit stiff  could've done without akwafina  some jokes fell flat for me  but i'm not a die hard marvel fan  and lastly the disrespect of a magical mythical creature was icky to me  not even harry potter steps on the face of a dragon  overall it was good  but could've definitely used a lot of refining  tony leung mentioned in an interview that due to the halt of filming during covid they had to rush to finish and it really shows ,Positive
1826,amazing homage to classic chinese martial arts films  truly a joy to watch and visual experience to soak in ,Positive
1827,truly an amazing movie! this movie depicts family very well  the visual effects are stunning  the martial arts are incredible  and there is just enough humor in it to relieve some of the darker notes  i can't wait for the sequel!,Positive
1828,i went in not knowing much about shang chi or the ten rings for that matter  i wasn't expecting much but i was wrong  and i am glad i was  great story  great cast and probably one of the best marvel films done so far  recommend taking the time out to see it if you are a fan of marvel/comic book movies/heroes ,Positive
1829,"good bmw ads and bad movie
cliché storyline
fake martial arts
just 1 star for new looking creatures!and
thats all good bmw ads and bad movie
cliché storyline
fake martial arts
just 1 star for new looking creatures!and
thats all ",Negative
1830,i can't express to you how amazingly beautiful this movie is  you need to watch it for yourself! excellently choreography  awesome blend of humor  drama and action  i was beginning to think there was no place for martial artists in marvel after iron fist  i was proved wrong  hopefully we get several more 👍👍,Positive
1831,an absolutely amazing movie! some of the best special effects and fight sequences you'll ever see! definitely a must see!,Positive
1832,the story is super boring unfortunately  because i think the actors are doing a good job with what they have  and are generally likable the cgi is weak  especially in the last half of the movie  it's just     tacky regarding the fighting  some people compare this to jackie chan movies  but it's nothing like that except for the first fight scene  then it's wuxia fighting  over the top dramatic kung fu that's not believable  it's less ip man and more hero  and that's bad the cameos are shoe horned in  i mean come on  why would wong be at the golden daggers club? the abomination? and the scene in the end with the two well known heroes are also nonesensical and feels like it's there to justify the movie in the bigger mcu also  when i watch a spider man movie  i don't want to see just peter parker  the same is true here  it's just in the movies last scenes we actually get to see shang chi instead of just shaun the kung fu guy ,Negative
1833,easily the worst mcu movie  it was celarly made in a way to suck up to chinese market and has 0 originality we used to get from mcu  weak story  full of overblown efects and martial arts is a balet here  childish elements too  in hollywoods ambition to prostitute themselves to market where they can make most money from the tickets   they abandoned true marvel fans and created a good night story for children with nothing but cheap emotions ,Positive
1834,the movie had nice kung fu scenes and nice fighting effects  but overall it was underwhelming first of all  was i the only one who was annoyed byt katys character  i didn't understand why she even was in the movie  she didn't contribute to the storyline at all  she was just an annoying side chick with unnecessary and unneeded comments of what was going on  i wanted to turn off the movie every time she opened her mouth  so why the heck would marvel make her in to a canon????and second off  it was a very jumpy storyline  some things did not add up  like why the heck did shang chis mother fall in love with his father  especially after he said that he was there to conquer her village  like  her first thought went to playing tricks on him and eventually dancing with him instead of trying to protect her village from him  like  say what???overall a mellow movie  marvel could have done it much better  especially if they cut out katys character and focused more on shang chis sister  the sister had at least a much cooler character!,Positive
1835,does everything the mcu does very well  a few of the things it does poorly  and then brings a whole lot of new elements to the universe  incredibly enjoyable ride in theaters  at worse  you'll leave feeling like it was pretty good ,Positive
1836,"well  i would have had more fun  i think  if i was aged between 6 and 25 years  waaaay too many corny jokes & stupid  added plot lines to progress story  the ""tell it to me like i'm 5 years old"" type of story telling   this happens for the first 20 minutes or so along with the eye rolling scenes and bad jokes  all forced comedy then it gets a little bit better going  but soon after  here comes the kid gloves  the really annoying asian sidekick/girlfriend  aquafina something and oh  wait  not a single sign of blood or any really deaths  chopped  broken body parts shown  like a disney action movie for pre schoolers at times i'd say it has its pluses with the excellent karate and stunts  cgi too but man  this was not made for anyone to really enjoy a fine  'take me away into fantasy'   not if you are over 30+ years imo  or only if you are perhaps a huge comic nerd and man baby fair rating from me  but i'd not watch again unless i'm about 75 years old and infantile again ",Positive
1837,uninspired cgi visuals with horrendously paced over the top insane plot ,Negative
1838,"i wept internally for 2 hours and 12 minutes that i had to spend watching this utter fiasco and abomination interwoven with chinese propaganda  if you are entertained with ""cool"" karate kicks  ""jokes"" that make you turn away from the screen in embarrassment and agony mashed with ridicule for western culture and and are eager to welcome your new despotic chinese capitalist overlords  my god you will be thrilled ",Positive
1839,"this feels like a disney movie rather than a marvel movie  and a mediocre one at that  hopefully this isn't the future of marvel  the only positive are the fighting scenes  the choreography is truly impressive  but the constant ""awe"" of the fantasy world makes for some bad acting ",Positive
1840,the movie is not well written  the story is below average and the action scenes also not very engaging  wait for it to come on streaming ,Negative
1841,as an asian  this movie hit me in the feels hard   all the cast and team members did a stupendous job from visual effects to martial arts action  what else to expect from marvel? best movie of 2021 so far  👏👏👏👏👏👏👏,Positive
1842,"don't get me wrong  from a visual and colourfully fantastical point of view  this film was amazing but for an mcu film  which we have all come to love for being so intricate and detailed  this film falls flat for me  it just doesn't make any sense with the universe that the mcu has built up to this point certain rules and historic lore has been completely discarded  and i think the villain of this movie is one of the worst and least relatable of the entire franchise  it just made no sense  and even during the climactic ""battle"" things were happening that just weren't explained  we just kind of had to accept what we were seeing as possible without understanding what was happening and unfortunately the character depth of most of the cast in this film was very poor  certain characters were sort of just there for the sake of it  with no real purpose or direction  and they were some of the closest characters to the main guy!i don't often say this   infanct i've only said it once before when leaving the cinema after a marvel film  i feel disappointed  confused and left thinking ""they could've done it better""",Negative
1843,i really enjoyed this movie  i didn't read any spoiler or review beforehand so i came without any expectation and and i think it was for the better because it surprised me many times  also  i want to propose that awkwafina should be included in every movie because she was great and totally stole the show (as she did in crazy rich asians)  looking forward to part 2!,Positive
1844,i can't connect to any character in this movie at all  kung fu actions is good  but there is a lot of movie on kung fu  this is totally trash movie that put a question on mind     why why why ??? why his father not care of his family and why main hero want to kill himself father too  why main villain of this movie not killed in previous fight when it faught he is not so powerful conclusion of this movie writers want to kill sang chi's father and sang chi too  that's all ,Positive
1845,i was very sceptical about this whole chinese casting marvel movie  worried that it would end up like another black panther  howwved the movie was a pleasant surprise  it captured chinese culture flawlessly  choreography is probably even better than winter soldier  with a lot of marvel style humor  however plot is has some weakness  but that is to be expected ,Positive
1846,finally a good marvel movie  was sick of nonsensical movies by marvel and dc since long with dad jokes type of dialogues and no concrete storyline or material like avatar  but i liked this one  maybe hollywood should make an indian avatar based movie  that would be exciting like some old indian gods mythology type of movie  as bollywood really sux when it comes to making such movies  they're only good at making good biopics ,Positive
1847,and what a gem he is  he took this movie from a 8/10 to a 10/10  he not only serves as comic relief  he is the heart of the movie as well ,Positive
1848,this movie lacks symbolism  decent acting and misplaces humour throughout the entire movie it still gets 5 stars because of the superb action it portrays  some of the scenes were quite innovative when it came to fighting and such my conclusion: not worth the watch  there are better movies in the mcu ,Positive
1849,just like loki in the loki series  shang chi isn't even the star of his own show  this is no way an 8 0 movie ,Positive
1850,tony leung carried the entire show  i hope everyone outside of asia and who are not chinese hope they know how lucky hollywood was to have him in a hollywood film  you can compare the lack of charisma from simu lu when you have them together in scenes  even awkwafina did a better job than simu  but good job for them finally creating a decent movie for asians representation!,Positive
1851,a solid origin story of marvel's shang chi loved it completely don't know what's wrong with the bad reviews i guess dc fans are super sad that even shang chi over shadowed their only hope this year let's face it the suicide squad is not going to be the best movie this year in fact it's overrated in opinion ,Positive
1852,obviously this film is heavily americanized  but the martial arts were so beautiful and well done! i haven't seen fighting scenes like that for a hot minute and it brings me back to my childhood  like watching jet lee  michelle yeoh  and jackie chan  i really wish they spoke more mandarin in specific scenes though  the english made scenes weak to me personally  idk being threatened in english didn't cut it  but when the villain threat the elder in mandarin  that hit different overall  i loved the movie and am so proud that an asian protagonist is in the mcu  i understand they want the movie to appeal to americans  but i'd wish they keep the movie a bit more asian traditional than super americanized lol ,Positive
1853,nothing innovative or cool  just bunch of pointless visual effects and usual cringe humor of mcu movies ,Positive
1854,i am a huge marvel fan  my kids young and old are all huge marvel/super hero fans  i have seen every marvel movie multiple times  and just finished binge watching all of them in chronological order again recently  this movie started out a little funny and felt like it was going to be a good action flick once the fight scene started in the bus  despite some iffy cgi and the guy with the machete hand  it didnt take too long to realize that was one of the few good scenes in the movie  dont get me wrong the fight scenes are done nicely  but they seem to drawn out to long  it all just fell flat  this is the first marvel movie that i didnt make it to see in theaters     i even made it to black widow  im glad i didnt make it for this one  i was beyond bored with the drawn out fight scenes  some of which werent needed  and lack of engaging dialogue  i never once felt connected or invested in any one character  i ended up turning it turned if off a little more than half way through  i have never done that with a marvel movie  even if ive seen it a dozen times before  i may try again sometime but doubt it ,Positive
1855,"shang chi was a joy from start to finish  simu liu and awkwafina balance the comedy and drama of the script masterfully  the movie felt grounded  which is refreshing in comparison to the spectacle of other movies released by marvel studios the choreography is top notch! this film has some of the best hand to hand combat sequences that i've seen in years and the cinematography only compliments that the real heart of this movie comes from tony leung chiu wai  he stole the scene whenever he was on camera and had me deciding in my head if his character was evil or not  which is a quality that only enhances the ""villain"" role in any comic book movie lastly  the soundtrack by 88rising was beautifully curated and i hope will pave the way for more diverse album soundtracks ",Positive
1856,visually it's good  story is bad and very very predictable  fight scenes  well old hongkong  chinese style kung fu fight  pretty much cliche though  starting bus fight was little bit of good  acting is just above average  editing is horrible  have few below average comedy( p j )   in short i don't like it ,Negative
1857,its a clasic chineese movie  jackie chan reloaded  a crouching tiger  hidden dragon part 2  but no a good way  the acting is a really bad  the only fun parts is two scenes when appear a familiar character from kamar taj; if not for marvel  this movie past like a refill movie of end of weekend ,Negative
1858,the action in this film was in fact a character  simi liu  awkwafina  and of course michelle yeah deliver beautiful performances! shang chi is this generation's iron man  the mcu is in perfect hands ,Positive
1859,easily the best movie on 2021   and the best marvel movie i've watched very colorful   non stop action! impressive movie that will mesmerize you! truly loved it ,Positive
1860,i think my rating is obvious since i'm more intrested in seeing abomination and wong than protagonists  nice movie cinematic!,Positive
1861,***spoilers*****i liked how they brought back the fake mandarin character  the dragons were really cool but wish they would have went more in depth about them  also if it has been thousands of years of protecting that wall why didn't they build defenses around it or a walk way that wraps around the mountain  just little details i noticed  overall i thought it was a good movie and had a good story to it ,Positive
1862,i loved the movie  it's very high on entertainment value and achieves a lot you would expect from a new character firstly  the storyline wasn't great but neither common yet it was sufficient to establish all the characters  and then hand to hand combat sequences were beautifully choreographed in 3 totally different settings   bus  macau  and at chinese wakanda  great to see that almost 60% of movie time was filled with action sequences and remaining also was mostly action related drama  background score  set design  and overall theme felt fresh i rate it high because comparatively previous marvel launch movies were not that great  but definitely this one also lacks on few aspects:the lead isn't charming or charismatic in appearance  this is his first big break so maybe it improves later when he is more confident the antagonist is easy  there was literally not a moment where you feel the protagonist is struggling  probably he wasn't supposed to be underdog  but his drive and passion to fight was not convincing  same for the antagonist the rings meaning or power is not yet explained which is a bummer  i am not sure what to expect from them  also 10 rings are kind of dumb weapon side characters/friends are supposed to bring comic relief however here it was pretty average small thing but the lead do not have super human strength or body  yet he can do those thing  maybe more is revealed later but this is same problem as black widow  suit also doesn't add power  this bit was disappointing because in marvel generally suit serves a purpose ,Positive
1863,"the movie starts good   but   soon begins the flashbacks and the nosense humour and anti climax scenes  and then the ""mandarin""    
seriously  this shang chi movie is the worst marvel movie of all  its sad because the pricipal actor does his job well  but all the other characters are bad to the bone ",Negative
1864,"shang chi review : spectacular visual wonder
my rating : 8 5/10
cast & performances :
the film has simu liu in top form  he is your ordinary guy but extraordinary powers and actor blends into the character well   with not a single false note  giving him good company are actresses awkwafina who is effortless in whatever she does and meng'er zhang who also performs some mind numbing stunts the star of the film of course is veteran actor tony leung  a father who wants to bring back his family together but also is aware of his extraordinary powers  it's his love for his dead wife that makes him tough and cold towards his children  years back leung had charmed the world with his subtle style in wong kar wai's 'in the mood for love'  decades later  leung has aged like fine wine and it's a delight to watch him play the antagonist with such style ben kingsley and michelle yeoh too make their presence felt in the limited screen time they have technical values :
shang chi scores high on its technical front  each and every craft excels in giving a thoroughly enjoyable superhero action flick  the top class vfx take the audience into a world of mythical adventure  the cinematography  production design and background score are top notch shang chi  directed by destin daniel cretton  attempts to shake up the marvel formula by infusing it with martial arts action and fairy tale fantasy and grounding it in chinese and asian american culture  and while its disparate elements don't meld together as smoothly as they should  they do  in the end  add up to a superhero movie fresh and fun enough to feel worth a spin"" shang chi's strength lies in balancing itself  for every high octane action sequence  there's a back story to get you readjusted to your seat  the amazingly choreographed fights will bring you to the edge of your seats and at the same time  you can't help but groove to the peppy background score  there are so many good songs on their list apart from music  marvel once again excels in terms of cgi  the graphics are so compelling that you don't regret stepping inside a cinema hall in times of a pandemic  they're worth it highlights :
cast & brilliant performances
stunning top notch visual effects
extraordinary high octane action stunts
fantastic cinematography
terrific background score
good story and directionoverall : adventurous ride into a mythical world ",Positive
1865,a marvel movie that morphed into a disney movie with shang chi as the princess in peril and in need of soul searching and having found redemption at the end sounds familiar?the only missing ingredients to make it a fully blown disney movie are the song and dance sequences marvel studios kept on butchering their own properties which is inexcusable  they should of stuck to the original premise of the hands of shang chi: master of kung fu comic book series instead of a mulan type with a male lead what a missed opportunity  this could been turned into a raid redemption type movie which would have been more appropriate for the character ,Positive
1866,so many things to enjoy  i really appreciated the lack of a hard focus on romantic relationships  yes there are subtle hints of a romantic connection between the leads but it never steals the scene compared to everything else  i'll be honest i wasn't sure how the ten rings in iron man 3 connection was going to be addressed but i feel they did it wonderfully  i was never bored and always looking forward to what was coming next  beautiful scenery  great chemistry between performers  and perfectly timed humor  really fun to watch ,Positive
1867,no hay nada más emocionante que descubrir la historia de origen den un héroe  y sumado a un nuevo héroe es doblemente emocionante ,Neutral
1868,not since black panther have i felt real representation in a comic book film  this film was funny  sharp  classic  and all around a great story  the actors athleticism and comedic timing really lent itself to a fun ride ,Positive
1869,this is one of the mcus finest movie the vfxs are the best  the story is the best and the direction   amazing direction the movie is full of adventure  a must watch !!,Positive
1870,average movie  i don't know but it felt like a cartoonish fantasy movie  more like kids entertainment ,Positive
1871,shang chi had so much potential only to be squandered by a sloppy  at times redundant screenplay that the cast largely struggle to elevate into something believable  apart from the siste and the always great tony leung  the leads and even some side characters lack any kimd of real characterization or charisma  making the 2 hr run time (inflated by meandering scenes instead of any character development) feel more brutal than the sanitized martial arts in the movie ,Positive
1872,be waterboarded for 1 day than watch that train wreck of a pos movie again  the b movie script with marvel money thrown at it                                      ,Neutral
1873,i left the theater almost speechless  i went in with pretty high expectations  as a asian american person i didn't really know what to expect from the mcu since it was really their first time introducing this type of culture and character into their franchise  but after seeing this it met all my expectations from the cinematography  to the lore of chinese mythology and action  i hope this film gets the hype it deserves it ties in with the bigger mcu and leaves some mystery for the anticipation of more ,Positive
1874,so far one of the best movies that i have seen in recent years  one of my 10 tops ,Positive
1875,the movie starts with a beautifully narrated and visually stunning story  this is always important to engage the audience from the first moment  this becomes a norm throughout the film marvel films are well known for their pop culture references but this movie does not fall into the trap of putting in references just for the sake of it  there is a perfect balance of comedic relief and heartfelt moments the characters are well constructed  especially shang chi  xialing and the mandarin  however  i felt that katy lacked depth the movie ended strongly with conflicting feelings about the antagonist  the movie leaves you thinking about it days after it ends i would definitely rate this among the best marvel movies of all time  and a very good movie overall!,Positive
1876,this movie sucks  generic predictable flat but mostly funky you disney ,Negative
1877,form the moment i sat into theatre i was lost in shang chi's worlds  movie doesn't rely heavily on jokes which is a big relief cause marvel movies nowadays rely too much on jokes they stuff joked in emotional scenes too  like they played thor's depression for jokes  thor meeting his dead mother after a long time was also foreshadowed by jokes  jokes occupy most of newer marvel movies even endgame falls victim to this  but this movie is different there are joked but they are placed well  characters won't joke between fights or between emotional heavy hitting scenes and boy the action in this movie its captivating to say the least  the dynamic between shang chi and his father is awesome  you sympathize with both shang chi and his father  marvel feels like old school marvel this time  its his origin story not many character pop from other flicks and even when they do they don't take much spotlight  definitely watching it another time     ,Positive
1878,was a great time  a lot of action  very good story  it's a different feel than other marvel movies ,Positive
1879,i loved it !but it didn't quite feel like a marvel movie     ,Positive
1880,a very extraordinary story in a film production just an input  i think it would be very extraordinary if every country in the world opened several places to be used as places for promotion of new production  of course also with the language of that country  this is an example of a good film production but not a few do not know that this is a good film ,Positive
1881,loved shang chi  simu liu and awkwafina are a terrific pair  tony leung is awesome as wen wu  excellent martial arts choreography  can't wait to see more of them ,Positive
1882,idk why is this movie so hyped  there were some parts where the cgi was bad  and the characters were kinda cringe ngl    i don't recomend whatching this ,Negative
1883,i like this movie   a great asian superhero   the good movie start phase 4 for mcu    i like it  ,Positive
1884,i understand how diversity is important and it seems like one of such thoughts in this film but no  i felt so strange to watch this film the last night  somehow i was ashamed and embarrassed with the story and all about this film respect the diversity  understand how chinese market is important for hollywood today  but please keep some balances and make more natural films ,Positive
1885,how can this movie get 7 5 rating? the story is so boring and predictable  no surprises  poor dialogs  over exaggerated fightig sequences and so on   waste of money and time ,Negative
1886,based on the critic reviews and the buzz i was expecting groundbreaking    i got good  compared to marvel's other phase 4 efforts i would put it below black widow and way above eternals the script was good  the acting was good  the fight scenes were    okay  the bus was the best  for marvel's best fighter he seemed to lose a lot i love aquafina but i think she needs to choose more roles where she doesn't basically play the same character all the time biggest drawback the green screen  it looked like you were watching 3d but didn't need glasses ,Positive
1887,i expected glorious fight scenes and the always awesome awkwafina  but  wow  this movie delivered sooo much more  loved it  #chickenpig ,Positive
1888,"movie was better than i expected the good things:
the fight choreography
cinematography
costumes
settingsthe bad things:
the second halfso i loved the first half when the movie was still set in a sort of realistic world  hated it and nearly turned it off when they crossed over to the village  absolutely ruined what could have been a new favourite with the ridiculous sci fi stuff (nothing against sci fi generally  but there's a time and a place and the juxtaposition between the two parts of the movie was too much to be enjoyable )",Positive
1889,amazing martial arts and epic fights  but it lacks plot in the ending and it's quite bland  still it's one of the best hand to hand combat mcu movies i've seen  good usage of comedy as usual for the mcu ,Positive
1890,mcu have scored another hit and rightly so  fast pace from start to finish ( do not leave until after the end credits)  and good  quality acting all round  especially from the hilariously funny sir ben kingsley ( nailed this one)  looking forward to where this takes us within mcu ,Positive
1891,i have to that this movie was great  it has a lot of action in this movie and the choreography in every fight scenes was amazing  also  the story was interesting and it has a lot of jokes that makes me laugh every time and the cgi and the visual of this movie was great  this movie was very entertaining  this is probably the best mcu solo movie after captain america the winter soldier overall  i gave it 8/10 because it was a great action movie  i like it😁👍,Positive
1892,shang chi was a refreshing new movie to the usual marvel styling of making origin character movies  it also was proper asian representation!!!the casting was perfect!the pace of the movie spot on!the soundtrack was great!the costumes loved!the cgi well done!the talking and banter was all done at the right places!the whole time was really engaged into the movie! i recommend for all and watch it a few times too ,Positive
1893,destin daniel cretton  who mentored who mentored two academy award winners  brie larson and rami malek and another academy award nominee  lakieth stanfield has demonstrated he has no limitations  two years in the making shang chi and the legend of the ten rings delivers on every cylinder and it has at least 16 you will find yourself laughing out loud a lot! you will be dazzled by the remarkable beauty and you will be transfixed by the fight scenes  especially the ones between shang chi's  (simu liu) mother  jiang li (fala chen) and his father  wen wu (tony leung) stunningly beautiful choreography  his sister xiangling (meng'er zhang) and finally  the one between his aunt  jiang nan (michell yeoh) the runaway bus is funny  brilliant  and exciting the story is engaging  multi layered and satisfying in every way possible ,Positive
1894,"first of all  my husband and i love superhero and sci fi movies  we have seen most  if not all  of them either at home or on the big screen  we love the action  suspense  and thrills most of the movies provide  while this movie was visually appealing  it lacked the momentum that my husband and i are accustomed to from the mcu  both of us fell asleep during the movie when things became so boring that we couldn't hold our eyes open  towards the end  when they introduced the ""comedy relief "" both my husband and i groaned  this movie did not need comedy relief; it needed action and suspense  neither of which appeared until the last 15 minutes of the movie  compared to the last movie we saw  ""free guy "" this movie fell flat on its face  don't waste your money going to the theatre to see this; wait until it comes out on free internet tv ",Positive
1895,just saw the movie in the theater and i haven´t spoken a word since  the movie truly takes you on a journey you don´t expect  the characters are the most immersively written ones yet  you can truly relate to (most) all of the main ones  tied in beautifully with modern culture  i love the platonic friendship between katy and shang it feels real  the movie has it's moments of just sheer beauty  and i liked the humor  does it have some points of improvement? sure  the immersion was broken a handful of times for me  however all together i loved the journey i was taken on  for anyone who hasn't seen it yet  10/10 fantastic journey  enjoy the experience!(p s  the music was sick  i loved it!),Positive
1896,it was great fun to watch this movie  :) i really enjoyed it  the visual  the acting  the story  everything was in the right place  it was a very pleasant surprise  i wish that the eternals would've been at least half as good as this movie was ,Positive
1897,the first third was really enjoyable  excellent pacing  well timed jokes and incredible hand to hand combat scenes  i already thought about seeing it a second time but the rest of the movie had a completely different feel to it  the second part for me was a drastic change (basically after the group is captured)  awkwafina  who was good in the beginning began to annoy with too many jokes and goofy moments and she did feel quite out of place which continued for the rest of the movie  the og mandarin appearing was a nice callback but he as well felt way too goofy and is just a cheap comic relief without actual importance to the story  you could probably cut 30min or so of less imports scenes without hurting continuity of the film  the final part was surprisingly different than any other mcu final but still came of as underwhelming to me because i really didn't need another cgi monster fight (although shang chi's dragon looked good) and all in all the whole ending was a bit too much of everything  first you got the village fighting the ten rings while shaun begins to fight his dad (this fight goes on for quite a while and could have easily been the end fight) who later opens a gate which leads to more fighting between humans and monsters and monsters and other creatures   you get what i'm trying to say  at some point you just want closure and as i already said  this final part really drags sadly some parts of the movie looked way more immersive than others and what also took away some fun for me were the trailers that showed way too much of the movie which takes away a lot of excitement (e g  abomination scene)  it almost reminded me of some old mcu trailers where they basically showed the whole movie the music did remind me a bit of black panther since it's a mixture of classical/culturally inspired music and modern pop songs  i definitely enjoyed it overall shang chi is still a good movie to watch because it has some talented new actors playing interesting new characters (i really liked razorfist)  a brilliant fight choreography and some cool set pieces  sadly it's clever and quick beginning forces the last hour +/  to feel kinda slow and unbalanced while the ending is a thing of personal preference  i still think you can enjoy the whole thing if you know what you're going into  the post /end credit scenes are also great ,Positive
1898,seriously what are you all smoking?poor dialogue  storyline depth of a kids pool  plot armour galore  to those saying this is culturally significant  why? not even worth the review but there is a 150 character minimum ,Positive
1899,the film contains a lot of confusing plot points that really make the whole story look underwhelming and uninteresting why is shang chi's father so blind (or stupid) that he cannot see he is being deceived by some otherworldly being? even after he sees that he released some kind flying demons out? and after shang chi tried to politely explain him this a few times?oh  and the father was just wasted within seconds and the mega powerful ten rings didn't help him much and this otherworldly being    the cgi monster  what exactly is it? it turns out to be the main villain of the film  but it's hard care about it at all i loved the jokes in the movie  and the first hour was fine  but the rest is just disappointing ,Positive
1900,it's not a bad film per se  but just seems like marvel are pandering to the eastern market  reminds me very much of  hd ct  but without the plot the addition of wong seemed forced  and unnecessary at besta poor attempt with only tenuous links to the rest of the universe ,Negative
1901,what a outstanding movie there was full of entertainment  i enjoyed alot ,Positive
1902,perfect fantasy film to watch with full family   you can't miss this on big screen ,Positive
1903,i'll start by saying that if you're looking for a great story  you'll be disappointed  shang chi is a pretty standard hero's journey at its core  which is a shame because the story could have been inspired by house of flying daggers and other wuxia titles so why a rating so high? because where the story falls  everything else excels shang chi is visually spectacular and a real treat for the eyes with some visuals that are incredibly distinct for the mcu  in regards to aesthetics  black panther walked so shang chi could run a marathon the fight scenes are all amazing  there's one weak fight  but it's meant to be weak  and they're all very long  which is great to see  one of the early ones went on for a solid 5   10 minutes  which was unexpected but far from disappointing the first actual fight scene is my favourite in the mcu  and i was worried none of the others would top it  but they were all delightful to watch  and i was so glad they did a parallel of it later on  either way  the writers went hard on the fight scenes and that paid off in summary  the story is lacking  but i'm glad in a way because that allowed everything else to shine  and shine  it did  i hope future directors take lessons from the aesthetics and choreography of shang chi ,Positive
1904,"the fight sequences  the bgm the vfx omg the story and the emotion everything was top notch
loved the movie every inch
#shang chi 🔥🔥🔥",Positive
1905,i am usually a big fan of the mcu movies  but this one is just not my taste at all  no hate on the actors  but the writing is just miserable it is way too predictable  and looks like any other animated disney movie  where from the very first second  you known how it will end ,Negative
1906,i thought i could casually watch this and play on my phone as well  after 5 minutes my phone was put away and i thoroughly enjoyed it  it plays like an updated jackie chan flick with smooth fight scenes and excellent effects  cameos are intelligent and not gimmicky  i will definitely continue to enjoy this new to me hero!,Positive
1907,firstly  i went into this with high expectations and the movie did not disappoint at all  i've gotten pretty much everything that i wanted from this film and more secondly  the story is explained with great care and it introduces the audience with amazing  new and fleshed out characters that really elevate this film to another level furthermore  the cast is exceptional and i couldn't have imagined any other cast to represent these characters  this reminded me of how the original avengers were perfectly cast for their roles  that said  i really have absolutely nothing bad to say about the cast  they played some distinct characters compared to the rest of the mcu with their set of quirks  stories  backgrounds and lives in general the only small complaint that i had while watching this movie was that the movie had spent a good portion of its runtime dwelling in the past about certain characters all in all  excellent movie with ton of flavor  great cast and amazing characters in a very dynamic story! would definitely recommend seeing!,Positive
1908,we have been getting used to ads in movies and marvel did it so far with an acceptable level  probably this bmw thing would have not passed the limit of notice either if the movie actually was good (or at least ok) stereotype characters: funny wannabe us girl  good dancers (khm  martial artists lol)  alien like evil dragon not even good for a chinese martial art flying over everything kinda genre  shame for grandmaster  ip man and also marvel world first 5 minutes already predicted the quality of the movie  hope marvel only declining in these side movies but not the avengers series where they mostly marveled so far ,Positive
1909,this movie has it all nostalgia(shaolin) + ninjas+ very good graphics+ comedy+ action ,Positive
1910,"the action in this film is on another level 
the cinematography is new propaply the best among all marvel films the last battle didn't really satisfy me but i enjoyed this film unlike many others 
i hope that marvel keeps it up ",Positive
1911,as an adult  i think this movie is a complete mess  the ancient master gets knocked out quickly while the car driver woman with 2 days of training saves the day  everybody should point this as a big problem so maybe they would stop making this kind of situation in several recent movies  but people are always praising and giving good scores  i really can't understand  the film industry will not improve this way ,Positive
1912,part of the problem was undoubtedly i expected too much of it after seeing the trailers  the storyline is largely all over the place and not very interesting  the biggest problem i have with the movie is it's formulaic     i've seen it all before  marvel is better than that but unfortunately in their last two movies the story just wasn't strong enough if i'm honest when it came to the end fight i just didn't care anymore and was bored by it i personally didnt find the movie funny either ,Positive
1913,there are two things i have to say about this movie  one  there was no moment where i felt like my attention was drifting off to something else than the movie  two  there was so many beautiful scenes ,Positive
1914,from my opinion it's a very good and amazing start for the new phase and it's also considered as the real start and the movie is better than black widow and spider man far from home also the movie makes us very happy and can't wait the movies that are going to be released like eternals  and spider man no way home to conclude the movie is a very good start for the new phase  big applause for the visual effects and cgi team and i hope the new movies or the coming soon movies to be better and better ,Positive
1915,incredibly cheesy and stereotypical superhero film  the acting was very 'meh' very weak written villain only redeeming parts were the cool weaponized rings and martial arts fight scenes  cgi was cool and sexy but in terms of narrative the movie was just     soul less  nothing new about it 6/10 because it isn't bad per se  decent action movie that looks good  that's about it ,Positive
1916,the fight scenes in this movie are very well choreographed  and there's some pretty good comedic moments too  it's a shame really that the rest of the film in between those scenes is either incredibly boring  an exposition dump or a mixture of the two ,Positive
1917,"can't tell the tightness and profoundness of chinese culture at all
the title is shang chi  but i don't see where the ""chi"" is  how to ""shang chi""?the chinese ""chi"" refers to the qi that exercises the qi and blood in the human body  which can be cultivated and practiced by qigong and other methodsbut i really can't see where the ""qi"" in this movie is?",Positive
1918,marvel studios has gained a glamorous reputation throughout the last decade  and this film was a huge milestone for superhero cinema  asian representation  and the studio as a whole  like black panther was to a lot of african american audiences  shang chi will ignite a spark in the hearts of asians  this film opens the door to a relatable character and i love simu liu's portrayal of shang chi  i have watched simu previously in the show kim's convenience as a comedic character and there couldn't have been better casting for shang chi  simu reflects the combination of an asian american character superbly and has an amazing screen presence  his character reminded me of captain america because of his leadership role in the film  standing up against all odds  and overall amazing chemistry with the rest of the cast  awkwafina's character  katie  was an amazing character  filled with comedic relief that gave a lighter tone  to a film that was a little bit too dark for a marvel film  tony leung's character  the mandarin stole the show with a vengeance  tony leung is absolutely ground breaking in every role he plays and the mandarin was a unique role he took on  leung had an amazing screen presence and was my character in the film  the visual effects in the film were unique and i could see that the animators had taken inspiration from traditional chinese films regarding martial arts  also having similarities in design to doctor strange  the action in this film was mind blowing like i was expecting  and i loved the fight on the bus  the soundtrack was average  with the usage of traditional chinese instruments  the songs used in the film were composed by primarily chinese hip hop artists and i enjoyed them  the writing in this film was good  but not great  one of the criticisms i have about the film is that the plot did not feel original and could've been executed far better  there were a lot of parts in the middle of the film that stole away from the central plot of the film  this film had a more emphasis on magic and fantasy as suppose kung fu  overall  this film is hands down one of the best gems marvel has produced  and i cannot wait for shang chi to integrate with the marvel cinematic universe further ,Positive
1919,this was a lot of fun to watch  the cast was great  they made their characters believable  funny  and told a great story  it held its own very well  the action scenes blend with everything they did  it's nice to watch something that takes you away  and you get lost in it  great movie can't wait to watch it again ,Positive
1920,i enjoyed every bit of this movie  the story was original the acting was super good it had some emotional and funny moments  it's just a super fun movie to watch  by the way i adored the dragons ,Positive
1921,middle part is boring but the ending visuals more like a anime live action it was good but not that good i meann i rated for the actors and their hardwork ,Positive
1922,some good action scenes  but almost all of them are interrupted by out of place gags like the ig live guy and awkwafina for the rest of the movie  really hard to stay invested because of that  it gets serious for a long stretch in the third act (where it crams all the character development)  but the goofiness of the multiple buttons robs what could have been a decent ending of any impact  the characters are left totally unaffected by the events of the film making you question whether they are sociopaths ,Positive
1923,the fights are good if you are a fan of the old kung fu movies  the story is pretty flat and basic the character development and motivations are very simple and boring  if it was 20 years ago and with no mcu it would have been fine  but there are so many better superhero movies  keep making diverse movies i would also like to see a sequel just make it good  make me care about the great action  the characters are underdeveloped and the story is just basic and overdone  they could have a great family conflict if they only made the villain more complicated and could have saved the whole ending ,Positive
1924,i walked into this film excited but slightly keeping my expectations at bay  and i walked out slightly disappointed this movie isn't necessarily bad however  i did quite enjoy it  the action choreography blew me away (bus fight scene was amazing)  visuals were probably the most stunning we've ever seen in the mcu  some performances were great and characters were written well (mainly wenwu)  and the cultural appreciation in this film really makes it shine (just like black panther)  it also introduced us to a new corner in the mcu just like black panther and gotg did and i can't wait for it to be used in future films  i did appreciate that it was at least trying to stray away from the typical marvel formula by incorporating more emotional weight during the third act climaxhowever  i had a couple issues as well  there was just some characters that i did not care for (mainly awkwafinia's) and were written quite poorly  the film's pacing also affects it quite a bit as it moves quite slow up until the bus fight  then moves quite rapidly  and slows down when the enter the ten rings compound for a needlessly boring exposition scene  the second act of this film was also pretty bad and it had everything that i hate about the current mcu films/tv series  tons of exposition that could've been explained in a more entertaining way  unnecessary jokes and scenes  and just a slog to get through  i also felt the climax dragged on quite a bit and overall  fell into the usual marvel formula of a massive cgi fight for the third act which is so overused and boring by nowoverall  i did enjoy my time and found a lot of things to like about it  but unfortunately  just like black panther  this film is getting a lot of overrated praise that i think it doesn't deserve verdict = 7/10 (better than black widow at least),Negative
1925,this movie was ok  great action  decent story  good one time watch  just like any other marvel movie  for a hero it was a great watch  didn't like the origin story but can't wait to see him in future marvel ,Positive
1926,so personally i'm not huge into the marvel scene so my score came as a surprise to me  the acting and character development was impressive in its own right  with a good scaling plot that never felt slow but built up like a good song there were a few moments where the animation completely blew me away  i've seen every new film in the cinemas for the past while and plenty of animation in and out of cinema and some moments were truly incredible would recommend anyone to go and see this  easily my favourite action film and maybe my outright favourite film ,Positive
1927,in short  you will enjoy it  in long  well you should go and see it yourself as there are a lot to talk about :) i first thought the dragon might make me not like the movie  i was wrong! i am usually not a fan of dragon but i liked this one (or i can say didn't hate it)  i hope you have fun too :),Positive
1928,great origin movie  the best one so far in the mcu  a little bit long to start  but great origin movie  the best one so far in the mcu  a little bit long to start  but from the moment the characters arrive in macao till the end  the movie is really entertaining  if the movie has one problem  it's that it's super predictable (common for all the mcu sadly)  apart from that  i really liked the artistic direction based on chinese mythology  combined with the great special effects and cgi it makes some super aesthetic and cool moments  i also want to highlight the charisma of simu liu (shang chi) and especially the charisma of tony leung chiu wai (shang chi's father) which is just incredible  for the quality of acting  it was good  great for a mcu movie  but good overall (didn't really like the acting of katy by nora lum  neither the prestations of the characters from ta lo  they don't embodies the wisdom we expect from them) overall the story itself is great  even if it's mayne a little bit too classic (fight for the memory of the mother against a not so mean bad guy that will go to the light side at the end of the confrontation for finally sacrifice himself   ) but all the atmosphere  the landscapes  the choreography of the fights  the special effects  some jokes  and the epicness make this film the best marvel origin story so far and a great marvel movie 7/10 for the movie itself  9/10 for what this movie is doing for the asian community  hope more people and children will be finally able to identify themselves in a superhero  really sad that this movie is banished in china   ,Positive
1929,"this movie was very disappointing  it was very poorly made and did not seem to be thought out at all  which is why i was bewildered to find that this movie was so widely liked by the mcu fanbase  and was saddened to find even some of my friends liked the movie  i've seen this film be praised for its good characters  humor  fight scenes and storytelling  but i strongly disagree with almost all praise for this movie  i will admit there are some things to praise this movie for but whatever they are they are few and far between this movie had some decent choreography for the fights  about a third of the fights were pleasing to the eye  however i only enjoyed 2 fights and that is only because the lead actor simu liu was the main focus of the fights  with simu liu background in martial arts he was able to do the fight choreography without the movie resorting to the overly zoomy and shaky camera with 5 cuts per movement that plagues most of the other mc movies  but sadly the rest of the fights are the typical marvel cutty fights or a gross mush of group fights with no discernible stakes the main character actually had some good moments where i felt like he was a good person and he actually did not cause casualties in the double digits unlike most of the other recent ""heroes""  but he has no personality and all of his decisions make little sense  the bad guy has many of the same problems where they establish his character but then they make him do things against that character  sadly there were no other characters that could carry them due to the fact that most of the characters in the movie were either soulless things with useless unfunny jokes or characters with exposition to shove down our throats  and only made decisions to move the plot onwards  this saddened me greatly because i rather like a lot of the actors in this movie there were 2 3 jokes in the whole movie that i found even remotely funny  besides those all the jokes were bad and lazy  usually ruining the mood of the scene or just carrying on for far too long  but due to the large amount of jokes and the little amount of comedic relief all of the ""funny"" characters seemed tasteless  unfunny and annoying the story told was not inherently bad  it just had to rely on the hollow dialog to carry it along  and with most of the characters not really being expanded upon they seem to only be vesicles for this bad move to work in all i did not enjoy watching this movie  i did however enjoy bashing on it with my friends and making fun of my ex friends for liking it ",Positive
1930,the movie was phenomenal in a 4dx theater  the fight scenes in the movie felt real and close to hong kong fighting movies  the story behind shang chi is set up through his father  which is unique through the mcu ,Positive
1931,people rating this low are just being overly picky  and i bet it's hard for them to enjoy anything    but for those of us who can enjoy things    this is just absolutely great!the fighting is spectacular  and there were parts that got my emotions going  excellent portrayal of characters ,Positive
1932,"ok this is a disney movie dont waste ur time if u r an adult looking for gd acting or a a real story  gd potintial but its another hero movie with a scene from jacki chan movie
he ll beat up everyone alot of computerized scenes then wallaaaa the hero conquer everything with the power of family ",Positive
1933,"i went into the theater expecting something pretty good from this movie  when it ended all i could think of was ""that's it?""while the visuals are spectacular  the story and acting seem to take a backseat  the two villians of the story don't seem compelling and the main character doesn't really feel special overall  pretty lacking movie ",Positive
1934,first review ever  all i have to say is you need to see the phenomenon for yourself ,Positive
1935,"the cgi are rather mudane but tony leung performance was simply brilliant its like his eye can transmit the sorrow
simply brilliant  i think an award should be apt the henchmen were rather underwhelming as well but all is saved by tony's performance
wish there can be more story on the dragon and the evil dragon ",Positive
1936,after black widow disappointed     shang chi will blow ur mind    visual treat prefect for big screens ,Negative
1937,one of the best mcu orgins stories ever told  this was such a sleeper film !,Positive
1938,outstanding marvel movie and waiting for the new version of avengers ,Positive
1939,it's been really polemic in china because of its original comics' racism  but to the movie itself  i can see marvel's efforts to avoid it and its intentions to please chinese audiences  and it truly makes sense  hearing a large amount of mandarin dialogues was the biggest surprise for me  there are also many chinese traditional legendary animals from shan hai jing appeared  the fight scenes and special effects were really amazing  better than any others in the marvel universe ,Positive
1940,i loved this movie! easy to follow along with the story  great scenes and it was even quite funny  i was either looking amazed or smiling throughout the entire movie ,Positive
1941,best marvel solo movie must watch in theaters action scenes are awesome  characters are good and post credit scene will give goosebumps ,Positive
1942,the movie was so in point   from the standard parent reference around doing better  around the typical girls and boys can't be friends they must get married at some point the the we can be responsible orrrrrr   honestly   this has hit me on another level with how relative to our culture it is! so well done   so authentic to marvel!!! and it's just the beginning!!!!!!!!,Positive
1943,"maybe there are just too many super hero movies now  but i found it boring  some visual aspects were good and it had an ok story  but just didn't find it as good as hoped for a ""new"" marvel take  the main actor seems more appropriate for a b flick too  he's new so maybe he'll grow ",Positive
1944,the action in this film is top top notch   something we missed in marvel movies and shows  something very similar to what we saw in daredevil and iron fist i loved how this movie is tied to past and future marvel projects   making it an exciting and welcomed addition actors did 10/10 in everything   and the story was well developed don't forget : 2 post credit scenes ,Positive
1945,the first real movie of phase 4  and it is absolutely awesome  from the story  through the action  to the world building  never before have i felt that a marvel movie is an entire deep and elaborated story  as much as this one the movie is definitely one of my top 3 movies in the mcu  and if it has any indication of the quality of the rest of the phase  we are up for an incredible phase!,Positive
1946,this movie was so beautifully made that i cried from just pure excitement  i had forgotten what it was like to watch an action movie so well written and executed that it didn't need comedy every other second to distract you from the plot ,Positive
1947,simply epic  i'm sorry but only reason to hate this is if you're bigoted  it's one of the greatest marvel origin films ever  no weak moments  great characters  great plot ,Positive
1948,terrific cast  fun character  and an enjoyable   if forgettable   story  this movie could/should have been solidly mid tier mcu fare  but doesn't quite make it out of that thor 2  im 3 territory of mehcu there are so many cool/positive things in this movie  that were just completely washed out by terrible pacing  weird story points (32 year old simu  playing the world's oldest looking 26 year old)  and criminally boring visuals  seriously  who decides to make a super hero kung fu action flick  in which every fight is in shadow or being panned over/cut away from?overall  there is enough fun just watching simu and awkwafina to make the movie fine if you're an mcu completionist  otherwise it's a safe skip bright side: simu as shang chi seems like he's going to be a real fun character to add into the mcu  even if his debut is less than stellar alt title: shang chi and the legend of the ten thousand flashbacks ,Positive
1949,just the poster alone says it all  the movie was great  great writing  great character development  story  acting  villain  comedy and the best fights like i just wrote the story was great  maybe you can say amazing  all of the character development was awesome to see and really entertaining  it was not at all rushed in the direction and at the same time didn't it bore me so save to say  it was one of the best non avengers mcu movie for me  i would watch it again and maybe even three times after that ,Positive
1950,marvel make a awesome file in the 2021 and thier stories of the character are so deep and the vfx was just wow i love this movie ,Positive
1951,good film  great action  decent characters  more than worth a trip to the theater  maybe more than once ,Positive
1952,not sure or both  making this perhaps a movie worse than it could be  sadly  high hopes not fullfilled  sadly  lets hope for more development  but i dont hold my breath  wong was cool as always ,Negative
1953,"i don't know that much about marvel movies but this great terrible thing wow really  i love it
one of the best marvel movies without a doubt ",Positive
1954,so bored! i hardly cared about the characters  bloated special effects that was style over substance ,Negative
1955,"just as some amazing marvel movies like black panther  ant man or guardians of the galaxy this movie takes a fresh take on the super hero formula  it may be at it's core the same: hero goes to a journey to learn and defeat the bad guy but it doesn't stop there and pushes it further  antagonists have their legit reason to be bad and not just for the sake of ""i'm bad because yes"" great cast  everyone made good performance  really liked tony leung as the mandarin  he can show lovely traits as a father figure and also a very scary/powerful one ",Positive
1956,well written  funny and well made  this movie make you smile  relax  laugh and hype you up at the same time  watched it in the theaters yesterday and i have to say that it's truly a masterpiece ,Positive
1957,well the fight scenes were exciting   the story was incredibly slow  not the best marvel movie but not as weak as movies like thor: the dark world  some of the best visuals in any movie i have seen which helps improve the overall experience  keep an eye out for a fun character to pop up as well!,Positive
1958,"shang chi is a good and more than a marvel movie
its a combination of black panther and thor ragnarok
funny  stunning action  visuals  great locations  and background score
simu lui has done a good job and he doesn't hesitate to bring his best performance and we need to talk about akwafina she is great as funny as paul roud    the conclusion: after watching we fell in love with shangchi cast ",Positive
1959,finally marvel came to asian actors   movie is quite good    and nice fight scenes    story is bit old    but the credit scene is worth    dragon scene are awesome    climax    predictable    ,Positive
1960,the story of shang chi isn't intriguing much  but the story of xialing is! honestly shang chi is least interestimg character in his own film  but the film is extremely pleasing to eyes ,Positive
1961,only watch movie enjoy this is a master piece a great great movie ,Positive
1962,the much awaited shangi chi and the legend of the ten rings released today in theatres  it follows the journey of shang chi (simu liu)  the son of the famed mcu villain the mandarin  who revolts against his father to fight evil the first stand alone film featuring an asian american superhero  shang chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences  all the actors and especially simu liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows  with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in san francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in macau  the standouts awkwafina and a surprise returning character from the mcu provide genuine  sarcasm laced comedy that adds another wonderful layer to the experience  cameos from benedict wong and ronnie chieng also manage to leave the audience in spits without stooping to cultural appropriation  with an all asian crew  director destin daniel cretton pays rich tribute to chinese heritage at every turn  hong kong's superstars tony leung and michelle yeoh are electric in their roles and the fact that they don't seem to have lost a step with age  acing their action sequences  shows their dedication as performers ,Positive
1963,must watch  simple origin story with super action  marvel is back with a bang!,Positive
1964,"i thing  and very sure that shang chi: and the legend of the ten ring is going to a part of superhero movies    
and marvel did well with the movie by not realasing it on disney plus like black widow ",Positive
1965,"this movie deserves my first imdb review  i usually agree with critics and imdb ratings  but this is ridiculous  everything is so bad that i can't choose the worst part  i never had high expectations  but man  this sets the new low the characters  the acting  the dialogs  the cg  the monsters  the machete guy  the soundtrack  the costume  the design  the jokes  the ""cute"" animals  the mcu references  the bad guys  the good guys  the ""love"" story  the whole family drama  i can keep going    i think that even if all the problems described were fixed  the movie would still be bad because the story is completely nonsense  unfortunately  it's a compilation of bad decisions if you were involved in the creation of this movie  my apologies  good luck next time!tl;dr   don't waste your time  it's terrible  the fact that most of the audience liked it is beyond my understanding ",Negative
1966,honestly it's amazing  the graphic effects are awesome  i love nine tailed fox  hope doctor strange 2 will be blockbuster like shang chi and eternals <3love you marvel <3 ,Positive
1967,shang chi is visually spectacular and combats well with the fight choreography  which is the strongest part about the movie  as marvel's first asian led superhero movie  it amazingly depicts the story of a young man trying to become someone who is completely different than his father and fits well with the movie's heritage of the mandarin  the introduction of the ten rings bring a bold new perspective of the weapon from the comics and becomes one of the best powers to have in the mcu  it is a standard superhero film as there is a huge cgi battel at the end  but nonetheless done beautifully  after marvel's mediocre first start of phase 4's black widow  marvel once again proves to us they still got it ,Positive
1968,i'll start with the strong part of the movie and that is it's visuals  the visuals are dynamically spotless  if i keep it simple then the movie is a complete cinematic experience  if you are going for the big screen experience then you shouldn't miss it now  except the cinematic experience  the movie lacks everywhere in terms of constructive and moving story telling  we only get to see incident after incidents and sometimes few of them doesn't make sense or felt forced as a scene lastly i'll say the movie didn't fall into my taste of movies since i'm more into strong story telling than breathtaking visuals  anyhow  i good one time forgettable watch ,Positive
1969,very predictable plot  me and my friend guessed correctly almost every major and minor plot point ,Negative
1970,the movie is so amazing   i was terrified with the visuals which were presented very smoothly  the direction and the screenplay were also too good  simu liu and tony leung did their great job in the movie  don't miss the credit scenes !!,Positive
1971,"top notch cherography and fighting scenes
and winwu is a great character ",Positive
1972,the movie is really good  got me engaged with it the hole time  the fighting scenes were awesome  the story was well written  recommend it to anyone who still hasn't watch it ,Positive
1973,really  i wanted to like this movie  i love asian cinema  but this movie just didnt work the first hour is at least funny and creates a little bit tension  some nice ideas and scenes in here but the second  in this poor excuse for a    chinese village     really ? lame uninteresting actors  kingsley and yeoh completely wasted  lame setting  lame ridicoulus fighting scenes  everything looked like a cheap cgi  groups figthing in the background  even the bamboo  what did you think creating this mess?aimed for nothing and got nothing!,Negative
1974,really enjoyed the story and the acting was amazing ,Positive
1975,when i saw the trailer a while back i wasn't expecting much  especially after black widow which was imo the worst mcu movie  however  the movie surprised me  the theme of a different culture reminded me of black panther but i enjoyed shang chi a lot more  i found it refreshing  the visuals were amazing  i enjoyed the action scenes very much  the plot wasn't the worst  but i felt like it was dragging out at times overall a very fun and enjoyable movie ,Positive
1976,really original and shows a new direction the filming of the mcu can take ,Positive
1977,"nonsense dumb time wasted lots of dumb jokes
nothing new
weak story
making fun of male characters is not nice and we don't want to see that ",Negative
1978,the first 40 minutes is basically just like a pretty decent asian american experience  after that  it uniquely brings you into the adventure of chinese (asian) culture that you've never experience before in an asian american film  it is action packed but definitely breathable and whole lot more of family drama  emotional moment that we chinese definitely understand  it does represent a lot of our culture in a right way with a straight forward yet engagging way of story telling  one of the things that impressed me the most is how much mandarin language is spoken and how every little details is shown that represent chinese culture  this is definitely a fresh marvel's movie and you shouldn't miss ,Positive
1979,loved the fight sequences and i was blown away in the second half of the movie    it's like on another level! phenomenal ,Positive
1980,"i love this movie
the story is unique and the emotion of loosing mother and the fatherhood is very very special well done marvel ",Positive
1981,movie all together is fabulous nothing is missing but last 30 minutes will make you go crazy!!,Negative
1982,the major concepts in this film are genuinely interesting  but they are ruined by several problems that have become a norm for mcu films at this point  the major things being that they commercialize it so much to a point where all of the significantly new and interesting ideas are made boring and bland  what i can say is that the choreography is genuinely excellent  overall it was fine but it didn't make me feel anything really ,Positive
1983,best marvel movie since thor ragnarok  great new addition to the mcu i love this movie and it just makes me seem so fresh and revived  the action scenes were so good the best since winter soldier and i just fell in love with this movie ,Positive
1984,the story is good  the visuals are out of this world  you'll definitely enjoy it❤👌 ,Positive
1985,the movie was good but the story was repeated so many time i had a feeling while watching that its just a marvel version of the movie raya who's so much better ,Positive
1986,what a wonderful movie  it had great action  beauty  sadness  happiness and funny  the martial arts where awesome and beautiful  the was a wonderful story line  welcome to the marvel universe shang chi  we're looking forward to seeing you again ,Positive
1987,"all i say is that when i see a movie got 7 8/10  i expect a much more powerful story and unexpected plot twists  even the fighting scenes were not good enough! kongfu panda fighting scenes are more natural :)
clothes design was awful but not as much as the story!omg! that was weak!!! i suggest this movie to under 13 y o kids who like fake fights out of nowhere   
special effects were good  👍",Positive
1988,totally different from usual super hero movies just great and awesome ,Positive
1989,not expecting it to be so much fun!action  humor  great fights!!visually stunning recommend will probably watch it again who knew aquafina was such a badass ,Positive
1990,this is not marvel movie like we use to  beginning was promising  refreshing and interesting but the ending was not to much disney in the movie  fairytale creatures  dragons  monsters  i was very disappointed with the story  not something i would lile to watch in mcu ,Positive
1991,it was amazing from the visuals to the depth of the store to the inside jokes that only true marvel fans will notice  this just another masterpiece made by marvel studios ,Positive
1992,the fighting scenes were amazing  especially the intro and the ending ,Positive
1993,this movie was spectacular  from the visuals  action sequences  and soundtrack  everything was amazing  literally had full body chills watching this movie!,Positive
1994,typical bland crap from marvel  generic and paint by numbers  this movie does nothing to be special  it was boring and honestly exactly what you should expect from marvel at this point ,Negative
1995,shang chi brings a lot of new dynamics to the mcu that have not been done in any of the subsequent marvel movies to this point  the fight choreography with fantastic martial arts action being beautifully captured and edited to perfection  the accompanying score that really paces the scenes well  and at times breath taking cinematography  however  particularly in the third act  it tends to fall back on the tried and true marvel formula that is become tiresome to even someone like me who is a huge marvel fanboy  the mandarin is one of the greatest mcu villains we have ever seen  i wish this was the true iron man 3 villain  however there is comic relief and exposition characters accompanying our heroes throughout much of the film that takes the bite out of the stakes  the third act continues with the faceless army versus b characters complete with a huge cgi spectacle at the end  you can seek how this borrows from other firms prior  particularly black panther  a fun watch  but unfortunately not the home run they were going for ,Positive
1996,spiritual magic  martial arts  fighting  comedy  it has a bit of everything for everyone  i highly recommend this film  marvel superheroes at their very best  if you watch films like this for escapism you won't be disappointed ,Positive
1997,an extremely boring film with absolutely predictable plot that is not worth paying attention to medium acting  but katy    total cringe in 90% of the movie fighting scenes is good ,Negative
1998,wow! after long time i watch a fantastic movie really its touch my heart  i always love to watch japanese & chinese mythological films  its really a great movie ,Positive
1999,smart  funny  and beautiful  hits the right strings with a good pace  awkwafina's katy really grows in the film and grows on you  solid performances from legendary yeoh and leung  although most of the movie it's easy to forget it's in the mcu  fun callback to a previously thrown away character and also a nice bridge to known elements of the mcu  plenty of new fare for figuring out the next phase of the mcu (and multiverse?)  two end credit scenes so stick around ,Positive
2000,this is the epic martial art movie  marvel studios do not disappointed viewers and they always dubbed in others language and the content goes to everywhere ,Positive
2001,i could already guess the end watching only half of the film  it's like an 80's chinese martial film ,Negative
2002,film is great overall and in this genre at least  is one of the best all year round that has been generally lacklustre  definitely a good movie to watch as it does what it is supposed to in that it is generally a setup film for something bigger in the mcu ,Positive
2003,"shang chi is one of the best solo movie till now in marvel  if you are waiting to come it on ott platform   you are gonna regret for not watching it in theaters (unless due to covid 19)  visuals are so much op in this movie  bgm of this movie will give you the vibes of kung fu panda(chinese instruments)  with some dj snake officials martial arts and other fighting sequences are also very amazing in this movie for those who are searching a good movie after 2 years of covid  this movie is that you should watch i t
beware of spoilers and you will enjoy the movie ",Positive
2004,good film  there were some places that seemed superfluous or unnecessary  but this did not affect the fact that the film is wonderful!,Positive
2005,didn't know about the movie and was skeptical but ill tell you u won't regret it  best movie out of covid times ,Neutral
2006,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie  it was so awesome  definitely recommend seeing it in the theater  watch through the credits  there's two post credit scenes!,Positive
2007,"pros:
fight scenes
similar li and akwafina had a good connection
funny
good cgicons:
bmw plug
slow at times ",Positive
2008,the movie was absolutely amazing! i wish i can see it over and over it again! defiantly will watch it again ,Positive
2009,this is one of the best solo(origin) movie by marvel i highly recommend you all to watch this fantastic movie only in theaters !and simu liu just killed it!,Positive
2010,i think i just watched the adult version of power rangers with a poor storyline  i would expect a better movie from marvel studios  well  at least my kids seemed to like it ,Negative
2011,the cgi in the first half of the movie is not as good as expected from a marvel film  there a some scenes where you notice this which ruins immersion however the second half of the movie is beautiful no complaints ,Positive
2012,best movie i've seen in a very long time  beautiful story  beautiful imagery  great action scenes  can't wait to watch again ,Positive
2013,my boyfriend and i saw shang chi during the in the late afternoon (3pm to be exact) so we missed all the rush  anyways this movie is really the best since i saw endgame back in 2019  the story is great and the special effect/cgi is amazing  it is a bit hard to follow at times since there's so much going on in the scene  i highly recommend this movie for any marvel fans out there!,Positive
2014,great story and it's totally worth seeing it was one of the best marvel movies i have ever seen ,Positive
2015,great effects  i have waited for the movie to arrive on disney plus and i honestly am upset i haven't watched sooner! great movie  the cast made the movie very fun and i enjoyed the creatures and dragon!,Positive
2016,"what an amazing movie      
really a visual treat for the audience shang chi deserves the best solo hero movie of 2021 visual effects are the best
super powers of shang chi are really good dont miss the 2 post credit scenes
marvel forever ",Positive
2017,easily my favorite mcu movie now  the martial art scenes were very intense and entertaining and i had no problem with the marvel cgi thing  the story was great  the character development was great  and the relationship between shaun and his father's relationship developed very well ,Positive
2018,this might be my favorite marvel movie to date yet  great visuals & songs  but most of all the cast that made this movie come to life  looking forward to the next one!,Positive
2019,excellent and visually stunning  the characters  though new to us  are well developed and i can't wait to see more of them  many humorous moments throughout the film  and yet it is still emotional and heartwarming  a great introduction to the new marvel era ,Positive
2020,an iconic film with excellent combat perfect new start ,Positive
2021,i rated it 6  just for the great acting of the father and main character  otherwise  the movie's story is so predictable  already consumed in the anime and previous asian myth movies wasn't for the show up of wong (and one other minor clue) no one could relate this movie to mcu don't get me wrong  it's a good movie  but not mcu good  unless    the story is still to be connected  making this movie only a bridge to a greater story ,Positive
2022,felt like an early marvel movie  the movie focuses on one quality story without the need for crossovers to make people see it ,Positive
2023,i went to the cinema with 0 hype and i get impressed ,Positive
2024,i really really loved the movie it was so cool i don't like marvel that much but this movie was bazzar gooooood job marvel ,Positive
2025,this movie is sooooo epic and beautiful  it had a good storyline and it really has a good first impression to the character  love this movie ,Positive
2026,total waste of time  iron man 2008 is so much better  meh        ,Positive
2027,from the never ending awesome action sequences to the beautiful music that enhances the experience tenfold  this movie is a masterpiece ,Positive
2028,"marvel studios' ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings"" is the latest modern day extension to the mcu? guided to craft beautifully by destin daniel cretton  shang chi has a massive soulfulness that future mcu movies need to take notes on and that only black panther did so memorably  it occurred to me while watching this movie that it is genuinely no longer about the characters we focus on  but it is their adventure toward locating themselves  and we follow that adventure here in an amazing superhero oriental fantasy blockbuster  noticeably  the vfx  scene sets  costume designs  and the special effects themselves incredibly heightened the impact of the movie and allowed a symbolic impact on the awe inspiring production value and  as a result  the aforementioned movie knocked out in dazzling heights on a beautiful scale because of the vfx  the movement sequences and choreography are polished and stunning  narratively  the storyline continues incredibly  and we understand the moments of humour the mcu is so well known for  and we are all here for it  this film divided me going to the cinema and waiting for a digital component! because of covid 19  however  i didn't need to have the entirety of shang chi spoiled earlier on with leaks  thank goodness i went to the very first showing on the opening thursday night  i have experienced shang chi several times now and in extraordinarily different formats including 4d x  this movie displays some of the most remarkably phenomenal combat performances in a marvel movie i had never seen in this noticeable approach previously  the movie is formulaic and well trodden territory for marvel and has several exceptional visual effects layered in  shang chi is such an enchanting movie to watch and even better on the biggest screen you can find  keeping safety in mind at all times! if you have seen marvel movies consistently  you've got to know that the narrative is a predictable storyline for marvel's superhero foundation adventures  this film is full of numerous great moments  with its battle sequences and action set pieces  which is arguably undoubtedly its major attraction  but shang chi has given us some outstanding personalities and characters in a live action film like black panther's did so on his solitary quest  marvel studios' shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is one of the most exceptional superhero movies i've watched in years  if not in the past decade  simu liu and meng'er zhang and tony leung chiu wai get considerable distinct and exceptional choreographed action choreography that we have not witnessed since captain america: winter soldier  there is not any one thing like shang chi i have seen before in the mcu  this film seems fresh  shang chi feeds us with the deprived traditional antique sequences of martial craftsmanship  which we appreciate a lot as an audience and applauds in an incredible modern depiction  this is one of the better  exceptional marvel films ever  i would recommend watching this one ",Positive
2029,the visuals were absolutley amazing  and the fight scenes were pretty cool too but then  there's just not much more to talk about the acting is average  and the story was simply not interisting  i personally don't hate this movie  (i mean maurice was pretty cute) but if you havent seen i wouldn't recommend watching it  it's not worth the money/time ,Positive
2030,10 for tony leung  he leads the whole storyline  best actor in hong kong ,Positive
2031,"i missed real kung fu so much!!despite if every marvel fantasy  the fight was incredible and exceeded my expectations i didn't know about this story of the comics 
i'm very satisfied and curious to know more ",Positive
2032,coming from an asian american upbringing  i saw parts of my personal story play out on the big screen  there's something so affirming and beautiful about seeing parts of my story that i wanted people to understand now be on full display  tony leung specifically did a wonderful job depicting a complex father  something that we all can relate to in some shape or form  marvel needs to invest in this franchise heavily ,Positive
2033,i loved the family narrative in this movie  probably my favorite family in the mcu  the action scenes are very good and it was visually stunningthe thing that drags this movie down so much for me is that it introduces things and shows us things in a very messy way  i really want to love this movie but i can't  the soul suckers really messed up the story imo  i feel like all the concepts introduced are very good but they aren't presented in the best way ,Positive
2034,the cinematographie can make this a masterpiece  i just really love the character writing of everyone in this movie   you can easily understand each character because you get to see caused there motivation  and of course the way they used the chinese language in this movie it fits the movie perfectly and pulls you into the story  overal a really funny visual pleasing and enjoyable movie ,Positive
2035,this move has literally everything  it's hilarious  got a crazy amount of action  and dragons (who doesn't like dragons!) i loved this movie the cast is perfect  great experience 10/10 no doubt  i don't know what it was missing but in my opinion it was the best origin story in the mcu undoubtedly ,Positive
2036,it was a really good movie  i enjoyed watching it  ,Positive
2037,the best start for a new phase in mcu  keep it coming    can't wait to see the next chapter !!!,Positive
2038,shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is a visual masterpiece: marvel not only made a very beautiful picture  but also finally worked on staging the battles!the film is very original  while watching  you dive as much as possible into chinese culture  enjoy the mythical animals and completely forget that you are watching a movie of the mcu  remembering this only when you hear a reference or see a cameo of a character you know as for the plot  it is very simple  straightforward and without a single plot twist  purely a fairy tale the humor is good overall  apart from a couple of katie's little jokes and shang chi himself turned out to be a little faded  lost against the background of everything that was happening  but he has potential two post credits scenes  one of which will amuse you a lot!8/10 ,Positive
2039,having worked on this film's visual effects  i can safely say that i was pleasantly surprised when watching shang chi at the premiere  up to that point  i had not actually watched the full film this movie is bolstered by a fantastic performance from simu liu  who i hope will star in many other great films  his charisma alone is a good reason to like the movie  the supporting performances weren't quite as memorable  but of course  they were not bad at all  as usual  the visual effects for this film were great (and i might be a tad too self indulgent here)  as was the direction by destin daniel cretton i am very excited to see where shang chi will show up next!,Positive
2040,absolutely fantastic! just don't miss it on big screen  i'd say  moderation of comedy punches  action and katy has my 💕heart! superb!!!!!!,Positive
2041,by far my favourite marvel movie of all time  great story  great actors  great visuals and overall a great experience i just wish i had the ability to forget it all  only so i could watch it again not knowing the what will happen next ,Positive
2042,watched it in dbox/3d and i just got to say  if i didn't have a kid i'd be back  beautiful movie and was a nice change  was excited to see a few in there from the previous marvel movies ,Positive
2043,too kuch talking  less action  by far the worst marvel movie in my life  and i've lived long enough  very typically chinese based movie  (i'm talking about the amount of cgi it the movie  90% cgi  7% talking and 3% action  however  it is angreat movie for your kids who doesn't understand anything or who haven't learn to talk ,Negative
2044,way way way too much awkwafina  bad actress and just not funny  sorry bout it  other than that  solid movie  enjoyed the tradition (even tho it seemed racist at times) and cultural significance  introduced new characters which is always good  just too much awkwafina  so annoying ,Negative
2045,"shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is the 2nd mcu movie returning to the cinemas all over the world and what a way to get back in the game  as many marvel/mcu films has the good and the bad the good: the most remarkable factor was the coreography from the action/fight sequences  very fluid and not exagerated the soundtrack was another amazing factor  we are talking of a mixture of cultures (i really felt black panther vibes on this one) that can engage all the marvel and non marvel fans out there regards of the plot  this one was very emotional and with lot of heart and power the cgi effects was on point (which was my biggest fear and sometimes a let down on other mcu films)the bad:
shang chi  along side of the cast lacks of good and reliable acting which with combining with the signature forced jokes was little annoying to see althought the plot was simple  this was a little predictable  but overall enjoyable final thoughts: despite of the forced acting  a must watch movie that definitely will engage the audience with all its assets ",Positive
2046,"one of the best marvel movies! great action (the best i have seen so far in marvel movies) and visuell stunning  the right portion of humor and loveable characters with depth in terms of the cinematography this movie seeks its own kind in the mcu  the character and plot developments are interesting enough to keep ones attention throughout the whole movie  this is not your typical marvel movie  but something unique and refreshing for the mcu  even not
marvel fans  who just want to see a good fantasy action flick in the style of chinese/hong kong
movies  can be well entertained by this movie  this is a movie to be watched on the big screen in the cinema!",Positive
2047,"i enjoyed watching this from the beginning to end  it was kind of a little bit slow in the middle of the movie  but i still enjoyed that i like how shaun think he should kill his beloved father to save the world  but he didn't i enjoyed watching the mei mei grew up as a strong woman and decided to stand by her brother i love the art of the martial art i like the way they hire real chinese actors (even if shaun is not chinese)
i love how they speak chinese  and only speak english because they learned languages i can accept the jokes  even the cheesy one made me smile over all  i feel good getting out of the movie theater and have no regrets coming home reading the bad reviews  just give me chills and negative vibes for me so i have to sign out ",Positive
2048,made an account just to write this review  by far one of the best mcu movies so far  amazing action  cinematography  and acting  combined with one of the best origin stories in recent superhero cinema go watch it!!! you won't regret it ,Positive
2049,"i was really looking forward to this movie  initially  i was a bit upset that i wasn't going to be able to watch it on disney+  however  after experiencing it on the big screen  i was so thankful i had to go to my local theatre to watch it  as a chinese australian  you rarely get to see characters that are similar to you  it was so nice to see asian experiences displayed unapologetically on the screen  the reviews that discuss how next level the martial arts are  really were telling the truth  i have seen plenty of chinese dramas where martial arts is displayed full on & i always found myself thinking the filming direction was a bit off  this movie combined martial arts from the chinese dramas & it was so natural and perfectly impactful  it is definitely not like the action shown in 2020's mulan  the sfx was stunning  it's better than what the other marvel movies have shown & we were just amazed at the effort and details that were placed i'm no acting major so i don't know my stuff but i did find some of simu liu's facials to be a tad awkward or a little too exaggerated however  he was still  nonetheless  wonderful in this role  tony leung  my god  he was the moment  he really shone in this movie for me  his natural swag & cool demeanour was so attractive and i really could not hate his character  i enjoyed awkwafina's acting in this movie  she really knows how to deliver humorous lines & i'm glad she had an impactful part in the movie & wasn't just the comedy relief it did hurt to see that my cinema wasn't packed especially since my area is full of asians  they may have not known about the movie since marvel barely did any advertisement for it  i definitely hope in the future i get to see more support for shang chi & the other members regarding the credit scenes: the mid credits scene was definitely a ""huh  that's interesting"" moment but probably not something to cause any uproar over  i'm interested to see where it goes overall  i really enjoyed this movie  there was so much mandarin incorporated in the movie that i am able to take my parents to watch it too!",Positive
2050,the was really good better than i expected it has a great story best hand to hand fight scene and more! i can't wait to watch it again more than 10 times i absolutely love this🔥 ,Positive
2051,i've seen it in cinemas about an hour ago  i was very impressed :) ,Positive
2052,tbh i really didn't have a lot of expectations going into this movie because i was disappointed with the stereotype multiple times but hell yea i absolutely loved this movie! (especially hong kong films martial arts prototype and the other fight choreography)i have no doubt to these actor since i know them all (awkwafina's role could be better)  they did put a lot of effort into mythology although it's a bit weird  well done marvel!,Positive
2053,"after 10 years of almost every movie being armed combat  this one is fresh and the perfect start for phase 4 (yes  the start is with black widow but is something ""old""  too related to the previous phases)  i loved every single moment  i got chills  i laughed  the soundtrack is astonishing  as the cinematography  the best of the mcu if i may  loved the colors  the fighting sequence leave you attached to the screen as they seem like they are dancing  all combined is something else  completely new and i can't wait to see more of simu liu as shang chi because he was brilliant go see the movie!!",Positive
2054,the movie had a generic story but really cool cinematography and fighting choreography with a couple references to some classic kung fu movies  acting was good overall with some beautiful synergy between some characters ,Positive
2055,so superrrrb movie mind bloing 10 rings do osm  sang chi and the legend of the ten rings   very smart grafics and power i so very happy marvell movie the best sang chi and avenger and game love you marvel ,Positive
2056,this movie does very well as a stand alone movie to just take a step back from the huge marvel universe  although what also makes it so great is the ties they make to the rest of the marvel universe so it feels like something new but also familiar  plot was really great  and action scenes were amazing great feel and aesthetics overall  really up there with dr  strange ,Positive
2057,this was the first movie we've seen since the pandemic and it was enoyable hope to see more of these characters ,Positive
2058,"from the chemistry between simu and awkafina to the fact that shang chi doesn't fall far from the mandarin tree it's just such a fresh take on a ""super hero"" movie  he knows what needs to be done and he doesn't have conflict he makes a choice and acts on it they really showed a true strict upbringing that made this character so different to other marvel heroes who have an internal struggle and shang makes the hard decisions! absolutely loved it and i want to see more of their universe and that's new cuz i usually say can't wait to see them in avengers  katy and shang need wedding bells i've never wanted a couple more than these two ",Positive
2059,"shang chi is 2 5 hours of your life well spent by basking in the glory of a compelling  profound story with absolutely breathtaking visuals  it's so easy to get lost in the majesty of the world that's being portrayed and to feel like this is your life for a short period  that being said  the movie is a double edged sword; not in terms of the movie itself  but rather the marvel cinematic universe as a whole shang chi evokes a feeling that i've only experienced from two other marvel movies: black panther and dr  strange  after 10+ years  the whole ""america will save the world"" and ""america is the center of everything"" vibe has grown dull  what these three films all have in common is that they do not focus on the ""america first"" mentality that has been the case with mcu films for so long  they make the universe in which these stories are taking place feel so much richer the movie starts off with something that i cannot recall ever having been done in an mcu film before: dialogue that is not english  the chinese dialogue with subtitles automatically makes you feel like this is something different  in the best way possible  what's more  there are numerous instances across the film where characters speak chinese  which makes the experience feel so much more culturally authentic the fighting scenes are unlike anything seen in any other marvel movie  there is a fluidity to the characters' movements which feels like dancing  these moments alone make the movie a must see the special effects are beyond satisfying  the creatures based on chinese legends look so lifelike that you genuinely feel like they could exist out in nature  the great protector in particular is jaw dropping and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time it's on screen  furthermore  any moment involving the ten rings is pure visual delight as for the story  a perfect balance is struck between a grounded human experience and an otherworldly mystical journey  the heartfelt family conflict moments are not the kind of cheesy stuff you usually get in a high budget superhero movie  you really feel for what the characters are going through and are genuinely concerned for their well being  furthermore  the otherworldly aspect of the story fits in perfectly with the aforementioned conflict  there are a lot of abstract concepts and creatures that wield strong mystical powers  and when you reach the end of the movie you might think to yourself ""i don't really understand everything that i just saw""  however  that's part of the beauty of this movie  it bridges whats familiar and easily understood with stuff that's very unfamiliar and difficult to comprehend  which leaves you both satisfied and full of wonder for the longtime mcu fans  wenwu perfectly explains all the references of the ten times dating back to iron man 1 and how good organization worked  trevor slattery also makes an appearance and plays a pretty significant role in the film  which fulfills the longtime wish of marvel fans to learn about his fate  his humorous role from iron man 3 is perfectly preserved  yet he's also given purpose beyond simply being a joke character  the character is ultimately very satisfying and surpassed all expectations i could keep going on and on about how great this movie is  it's truly a marvel masterpiece and deserves all the accolades it will inevitably receive ",Positive
2060,"i won't say believe on my review    but just watch it once   it will worth your money and time   this movie has every thing you wanted to see in an origin movie
1) really strong main villain
2) awesome secondary villains
3) nice back story
4) 5 star fighting scene and vfx
5) villains from phase 1 and 2of iron man andnhulk
6) magic and mystic   humor and emotion at right proportion
chery on top of cake = post credit and mid credit ",Positive
2061,aesthetically beautiful and such likable characters amazing work by simu liu and awkwafina  also a special shoutout to ben kingsley whose trevor slattery made me laugh so hard everytime he was on the screen can't wait to see what's coming in the mcu to these amazing characters ,Positive
2062,just an another amazing movie brought by mcu with adding a new character to marvel universe  overall fantastic movie with the point of view of storyline and action sequences which really are one of the best among all marvel movies till now  it is clearly visible by this movie that there's something big planned by mcu in future which would be amazing to watch  at last just watch this movie you will love it ,Positive
2063,"positive
 great casting (simu liu  tony lueng)  especially tony lueng because he look badass and has great acting skill  you've already heard people praising the film's action choreography  and it's well deserved  it doesn't has many cut scenes like many mcu fighting scenes  this film felt completely unique from what we've seen from the mcu already  props to the beautiful cinematography and soundtrack as well  they were great! the first two act was incredible and amazing showing the life of shang chi  how wenwu meet his wife etc  this type of act is something mcu usually doesn't have  this film open up mcu to new world with myth creature  many evil organization  and the mystery of the ten rings negative
 the casting was stellar  aside from the one person i didn't care for (*razor fist  cough cough*) everybody played their roles to perfection  the jokes may not be funny to some people  but it's funny to me  the only issue i had with shang chi was the third act  not that it was bad  but it felt detracting from what the first 2/3rds of the movie established  it become every mcu logic part(cgi battle)  it took away from the great hand to hand action stunt work  but it's to be expected from a film of this genre the exposition can be a bit heavy but understandably needed to introduce a brand newcharacter into this universe imo
great way to introduce new hero  great martial art fight scenes  great characters  looking forward to shang chi  also wenwu not a top tier film in movie industry but a top tier film in mcu standalone movies ",Positive
2064,this movie is something different to movies with action im the mcu like iron man and captain america  shang chi connects with the public so quickly  simu liu is so funny and his character is so emotional katy    wow  what i can't say about her    along with luis in antman's movies  katy is the perfect partner for shang chi at the beginning you think is the classic character that you just see 15 minutes and never return  katy was actually glued with shang chi all the movie and her acting was so perfect  that i couldn't handle my laugh  if you like the action movies based on bruce lee's classic movies and kill bill movies  this is your movie  if you don't like the marvel movies it doesn't matter ,Positive
2065,just got back from the theatre and the movie was absolutely amazing! the action that marvel studios promised us was beautifully delivered  without saying much  overall  the movie is an action packed joyride with subtle humour here and there  as expected ,Positive
2066,"best and worth to watch in big screen  satisfied the expectations cgi is top notch  and ""no words"" to discribe the movie ",Positive
2067,i heard that this film was going to be good  and it was better than i had imagined!! the storyline was really new and exciting for the mcu  the fight scenes were fantastic i couldn't keep my eyes of the screen  it also had its funny parts just like marvel always has! i can't express enough how much i enjoyed this film ,Positive
2068,this movie is action packed with the best action scenes i've seen in the mcu  the story was great and all the cast shined throughout the movie  10/10 would watch again!,Positive
2069,ten rings are stronger than i thought  also it's the first asian marvel movie  i hope for more asian marvel movies in future ,Positive
2070,incredible special effects  incredible action sequences that stand out in the mcu  incredible back story to shang chi  everything is incredible until katy starts talking  there was no need for her character  she wasn't funny  if this movie didn't have her it would've been one of the top 10 mcu movies ever made  everything good about the movie barely makes up for how much her character sucks ,Positive
2071,"some of the best action scenes yet  great backstory and character development  one of the best mcu ""villians"" yet  overall very refreshing and enjoyable ",Positive
2072,plot is expected  acting was okay  but overall  the movie was not so great ,Positive
2073,very satisfied when watching at the cinema  but still very difficult when watching it at home  at first i underestimated this film  i thought it would be bad  but i was totally wrong  a very good film  the cgi visual effects are very capable and rich  i will watch it for the 2nd time  9/10 for me  i'm satisfied ,Positive
2074,even mortal kombat 1995 has better fighting scenes  not recommending ,Positive
2075,hands down one of the best solo marvel movies made ,Positive
2076,martin scorsese called most of these generic mcu movies theme park movies and this movie is perfect example of that  there are some great mcu movies  but seems like marvel isn't even trying to separate themselves from theme park stigma  when they make movies like this ,Positive
2077,it's so extremely generic and made with no passion or soul in it  it's just another super generic origin story where main character is basically invincible and beats the bad guy and saves the day  so he could later join some endgame style movie ,Negative
2078,right now only mcu movie that actually has any passion behind it is spider man no way home  shang chi was just another generic origin story  but of course i went to see it  just so i could write this review ,Negative
2079,"i was so excited for this movie and i was not disappointed  it had cgi  an amazing cast  a great soundtrack  setting etc  i have nothing bad to say about this movie  other than that i dislike some of the bad guys  but that's what makes them bad guys so   
i was so shocked when i saw the end credit scene with hulk and captain marvel and wong  i love shang chi and katy's friendship and i just think that this movie is awesome  also the martial arts and the stunts were awesome  especially the train scene and the fight in the macao  so i'm just ending this to say that i love this movie and it's my new favourite marvel movie!!",Positive
2080,i was hesitant to watch this because i know how generic marvel movies are  but i was like why not? my mistake i guess  now i just feel like i wasted my money  it was so boring  might as well be streaming movie ,Negative
2081,not worth watching or wasting your money on it  some obvious fanboys are trying to hype it up  but it's not that good  if you like actual martial arts movies  i would recommend some older stuff from 70s ,Positive
2082,despite them not promoting this a lot it was a game changer  different kind of genre and pace! they mixed and match well the cgi out of this world  and the acting chemistry between all actors  thanks for blessing us!best movie of this year  easily 10/10  you would be surprised with some newcomers to marvel!be prepared to have your mind blown!!!,Positive
2083,extremely overrated movie for no reason at all  it doesn nothing new  only thing marvel has left is spider man right now  everything else is just super meh ,Positive
2084,these positive reviews mean nothing  everyone already knows it's bad movie  most people who leave positive reviews haven't even seen it yet  i actually went and watched it  it's so generic ,Negative
2085,"overall very disappointing (as expected) another generic marvel flop  it will obviously make no money  because nobody has never heard of this ""superhero"" ",Negative
2086,overall it's nothing new or very creative  i have no idea why some people pretend like it's new coming of movies  it's not  it's meh at best  wait for streaming!,Positive
2087,well here's my review  after just reading the reviews on here i came across some bad reviews and laughed at them  most of them are saying the villain was bad (not a spoiler: his dad) or they are saying it doesn't fit in the new marvel universe  i also saw one review who gave a 1/10 and said it was because of one of the actors in the post credits scene  for the people who are reviewing bad reviews don't like a new superheroes being asian the movie was a perfect it made you feel sorrow for the character and the position he was in between his father  you could feel the weight he had on his shoulders  the beginning of the movie starts with the fear of unknown  you don't know who is after him  you go through many happy and sad emotions  the movie also did a excellent job using the characters native language  the fight scenes are astonishing and the cgi was beautiful  the wasn't any cgi characters that didn't look real  the cast and crew should be proud of a beautiful masterpiece they made  amazing amazing!,Positive
2088,how has this movie 8 1 rating makes no sense  this movie was super generic  i was expecting something great  but it was worse than black widow and that's not easy thing to do ,Positive
2089,i was expecting fun marvel movie  instead i got some random kung fu movie with superhero i have never heard of  so bad ,Negative
2090,the reason i like this movie so much is because the movie is very easy to understand  the jokes were fine  the cgi was amazing  and it's different than most marvel movies  and simu liu is an amazing actor and played the role amazingly ,Positive
2091,i am a chinese  i have seen jackie chan's martial arts movies and donnie yen's martial arts movies  but i think this movie is definitely the best of any combat drama i have ever seen  the music and background story remind me of me my parents' education  and i can see that marvel is very serious about this first superhero movie starring a chinese  and it has its connotation  the chinese dialogue is very standard  after watching it  i can enjoy endless aftertastes ,Positive
2092,i was worried this movie would be a bust but it was so much better than black widow and had some great fight scenes  though it's not my favorite marvel movie of all time (i am a huge marvel fan)  i found it to be a decent action movie and a pretty good plot for a marvel origin story tony (the mandarin) was freaking amazing  some of the best acting i've seen in a marvel movie and by far the best actor in the movie  akwafina surprised me as i thought she was an odd casting choice but her and simu had great on chemistry on set  also shout out to wong the og asian marvel superhero definitely see this movie!!!!!,Positive
2093,this is a visually stunning movie  with great action scenes and fabulous fights  the asian and asian american representation hits home for me  being a half asian canadian  and the comedy is there  when needed  there is also a nice addition of female power in the movie  that isn't too overwhelming  like the all female fight scenes in endgame and infinity war(no hate just my opinion)  this is for sure a must see movie for action movie  marvel  or even just movie fans ,Positive
2094,"marvels new master is shang chi
best action sequences with best bgm
and best vfx and don't miss the credit scene ",Positive
2095,quite a lot of representation and it is great that they are trying to expand marvel's repetoire  main character could have been casted a little better ,Positive
2096,this movie is one of the best cinematic experiences i have had  it will live on as one of the best marvel films ever  there was comical relief in all the right places  the casting was without a doubt top notch  it was a wonderful way to introduce a new avenger ,Positive
2097,rotten tomatoes makes it seem like it's on same level with spider man 2 or the dark knight  but it's not even close to same level  it's most basic mcu origin story possible  what's the point of these scores when one movie is masterpiece (spider man 2) and another is super mediocre (shang schi)  but both have same rotten tomatoes score  it makes no sense ,Positive
2098,how incredible sad is to watch modern marvel disappoint second time in a row  obviously it wont even go over 350 million worldwide  boring  generic movie  would have been better as streaming movie  then some people would at least watch it and maybe react to it on youtube  because that's where most of suicide squad popularity came  wont happen with this movie tho  because nobody can watch it on streaming and nobody cares that much about this movie to go to cinema  maybe hardcore marvel fans will  but most people wont ,Positive
2099,"shan chi gives a totally different vibe from other mcu movies which has touched me so deeply  it was really very important for phase 4 and shang chi did a really great job!!! i loved this movie   so i gave it 10/10  it has both action and emotion to catch the audience  it surely won't disappoint anyone whether he/she is a marvel fan or not
this was worth of watching ",Positive
2100,some reviews act like it's new coming of martial arts cinema or something  but no  it's just harry potter who does kung fu  very generic and predictable ,Negative
2101,rotten tomatoes makes it seem like it's on same level with spider man 2 or the dark knight  but it's not even close to same level  it's most basic mcu origin story possible  what's the point of these scores when one movie is masterpiece (spider man 2) and another is super mediocre (shang schi)  but both have same rotten tomatoes score  it makes no sense ,Positive
2102,movie like this is way better to watch on streaming than on cinema  i'm actually regretting going to watch this  while suicide squad was at least something new for dc  shang chi was absolutely nothing new for marvel ,Positive
2103,seems like dc will be the king (again)  because after no way home  they have literally nothing to care about  i used to like both  but right now dc seems to be so much more creative with doing all kinds of different movies  for example compare how extremely different are joker and suicide squad  but both are great in their own way  but in marvel  every movie feels exactly the same  same meh effects  generic villains and cringe jokes ,Positive
2104,don't believe positive reviews that try to hype up this movie  unlike them  i actually went to cinema to watch it and it was possibly most generic mcu movie i have ever seen  just cause movie has some cool new visual effects  doesn't automatically mean it has depth or interesting characters ,Positive
2105,"there is no need to explain about a marvel movie  and it's a excellent debut movie for a new hero  value for money! greatest movie of all time in action and bgms are awesome  chinese tunes!!! action scenes are best in all time marvel movies    excellent vfx and cgi
atlast i'm giving to this movie  i can't rate this movie    excellent!you should've watch this masterpiece   ",Positive
2106,i loved this movie  amazing asian representation!very funny and intense  brilliant fight scenes!!,Positive
2107,this film was outstanding! i loved the backstory of shang chi  possibly one of the mcu's best yet  it was very cultural  i loved how they spoke in mandarin or whatever it's called half the time  the cgi was incredibly top notch and the cast was simply superb   simu  tony and fala etc all did an awesome job  but my favourite was definitely awkwafina! it was also such a pleasure to see benedict wong again and some more familiar faces   all in all  absolutely amazing  can't wait to see what's next!,Positive
2108,plot  action  comedy  emotion  character  relationships  theme  development  cinematography  all 10/10  go watch!!,Positive
2109,depicts asian american life perfectly  can confirm as a sf asian american native  katy's pretty damn accurate ,Positive
2110,this movie surprised me in a good way! i was expecting it to be a flop but it was honestly great! the action and storyline all together made it! marvel did a really good job with this one and met all expectations ,Positive
2111,watched it yesterday  overall the movie was wonderful  mcu put everything so perfectly  the cast  visuals  cgi everything was on pinpoint  every characters performance was brilliant  i need to mention this because without this character the movie would not be that interesting and that role is played by awkwafina as katy  her comic timing was so good  and as always marvel surprised me to have the villain as tony chiu wai leung as as xu wenwu  his performance was brilliant along with our new hero simu liu as shang chi definitely worth of time  go watch the movie in the theatre and don't spoil ,Positive
2112,still can't get over the movie even after watching it for two times in two days didn't want to miss this in theatres as this is releasing after two years  one of the best marvel movie out there ,Positive
2113,the cgi and story telling was out of this world  character development too! the ones who gave it a bad rating clearly has 0 taste and probably did not watch the movie  this movie made people into shang chi fans! marvel stepped up! and i am happy!!!!,Positive
2114,this movie was amazing if you have not seen it i highly recamend you see it ,Positive
2115,after an 18 months absence from the cinema  this was a great first film to watch  visually it's amazing  great fight scenes  loved the actors and actresses and so funny  and the icing on the cake was ben kingsley  not sure why he was there but it really worked ,Positive
2116,"great characters
strong plot
amazing visuals
pretty serious movie  none of the typical unnecessary marvel humour ",Positive
2117,it wasn't bad i really liked it  i'm not even a big marvel fan but i really enjoyed this movie ,Positive
2118,this movie had amazing choreography and a great story  it was a great mixture of comedy and seriousness and i can't wait to see what more they have of shang chi and the ten rings ,Positive
2119,kudos marvel for having the guts to make this film ,Neutral
2120,some of the action and fight scenes are eye candy but the movie is generic and boring  every cliche from a kung fu/ fantasy movie is there  including flying dragons  skip this one at all costs ,Negative
2121,one of my favourite marvel movies  can't get over how good it was  simu liu ( shang chi himself) did such an amazing job along with the rest of the cast ,Positive
2122,was such a great movie and then the climatic fight was amazing (side note if disney got the rights to do a dragon ball z live action movie it would be great if they use the same director of this movie),Positive
2123,it's simply of the best mcu origin story along with ironman  black panther  and gotg  the character development was great  cinematography was unique and definitely created a new style of scenery in the mcu  while the fight choreography blew my mind and it is by far the best fight sequence mcu has to offer since winter soldier  and the cgi was top tier even though it's a martial arts movie it blended in perfectly  and the performances of the actors and actresses was on point  and having a good villain is not really common in the mcu but in this movie you will actually care for the villain and his backstory unlike most of the villains the mcu has produced  hence this is why i think it's one of the most iconic and one of the best hero origin story and movie out there ,Positive
2124,the action sequences and cinematography are some of the best yet in the mcu  this movie is visually stunning and a pretty fun film for what it is  but the story in general was just poorly written and at times seemed amateur  there was about 7 too many slow motion scenes where characters randomly stare at each other  and the first 30 40 minutes of the film just felt so random and out of place  it is also weird that a dragon shows up at the end and sort of steals the show from shang chi as he is just about to start to shine and take the role as the lead protagonist  all the actors did great in their roles  but shoddy writing really brought the whole thing down for me ,Positive
2125,felt so fresh  this is exactly the type of movie the mcu needed to keep the hype train chugging ,Positive
2126,the movie was such a beautiful motion picture and had such amazing things to share in regards to culture  the lines outside the theatre were long and they were all different lines for different shang chi movie times  at first i was like wow is it really that good? but after finishing i found it to be super touching  heart wrenching at times  but still meaningful  and a marvel cinematic masterpiece  i encourage people to watch it! 1000/10 if possible!,Positive
2127,"part with no spoilers
this film was absolutely amazing! almost every aspect of the film was perfect and it smashed my expectations and took it's place as one of the best marvel films  or any films that i have seen the visual effects in this movie were fabulous  there were plenty of captivating scenes with astounding usage of modern technology  the cinematography was probably one of the best i have seen in a film for a while  it kept you captivated and on your toes the entire time! i also noticed light being used to make the scenes even more captivating  which is something you don't always see in films the dialogue was solid and didn't feel clunky or wierd  the jokes were well spaced and gave your muscles a rest from being tensed the action was perfectly filmed and beautiful  it felt like they were dancing  the choreography was very impressive the story itself was nothing unexpected  pretty much a generic origin story  but don't worry that doesn't take away from the film at all!and lastly the villain was for me one of the most interesting aspects of the film  they made you feel for him and gave him an interesting charachter with a non generic motive  i haven't felt for a villain this much for a long while ps: there are two post credit scenes so stay after the credits part with spoilers
and i just wanted to say i loved the return of trevvor slattery! it was such a surprise and something they managed to keep out of the trailers  he was hilarious especially where he played dead  also i like the fact wong played a role in the film  the scenes with him were interesting  the post credit scenes set up the sequel which i will be very interested to see! can't wait to find out what the sister does and who the rings are calling ",Positive
2128,story amazing  fight scenes amazing  scenery amazing  everything amazing ,Positive
2129,my opinion is very legendary fight and super movie ,Positive
2130,loved it from the beginning til the end  this movie deserves all the hype and i was not disappointed ,Positive
2131,during watching movie i had this flavor of jackie  after the film i found out that brad allan from jackie team helped with fight scene   want to rewatch it again ,Neutral
2132,visuals alone can make you think about the awesomeness of the movie  above that the blend of emotions in action scenes was a great approach  strong acting by all the actors and tony leung was just amazing  a perfect treat for marvel fans ,Positive
2133,i never write reviews but let me tell you i enjoyed this movie with every inch of my heart and i speak for the rest of the people in the theate as well  it was definitely a big win for chinese americans i just simply enjoyed how it portrayed both the english and chinese language! i recommend this movie to anyone or any family out there looking for a good laugh and a beautiful cinematic piece  shang chi:),Positive
2134,martial arts master shang chi confronts the past he thought he left behind when he's drawn into the web of the mysterious ten rings organization ,Negative
2135,just ask yourself where this movie would be without special effects ,Positive
2136,epic fight scenes without too much visually clutter like most marvel movies great actors funny moments impressive characters and backstoriesand the best part wong ,Positive
2137,as someone who loves martial arts movies i think that shang chi was a beautiful homage to the classics while also introducing a newer take with its ties to marvel as well as including modern asian american experiences  personally it is one of my top marvel movies!,Positive
2138,no joke  i have not been on my feet since the scene of end game when everyone came back   marvels really done it again with this one if you're into action packed with a vivid and dramatic story line that pulls the viewers into the moment  father and son and family dramas suffer through increasingly dangerous scrapes  they discover each other's tragic histories  they're torn apart and put back together and fall into an impossible feat  fate and geopolitics are put the test ,Negative
2139,this movie was one of the best if not the best marvel movie so far the acting is amazing and the fight scenes are great ,Positive
2140,very enjoyable! visuals and action sequences were amazing  storytelling was well done ,Positive
2141,very good movie and one of the amazing marvel series keep going 💪🏼💪🏼😍,Positive
2142,the visual effects is great  the problem is with the whole story  the first half was pretty boring  they same typical storyline of women victimhood  where city people are regressive  where else people from the village are so progressive  woke 101 some of the storyline are quite similar to iron man  where father plays the important role but special effects are really good there is a big surprise towards the end ,Positive
2143,this movie always stole my heart's whole part🔥🔥❤❤    this is the best single hero movie i had ever seen❤,Positive
2144,visually stunning and good action scenes good film in general  do not have to be a marvel fan to enjoy the film ,Positive
2145,shang chi was beyond my expectations  some of the best acting  fight choreography  and visual effects i've seen from marvel in a while  the story itself had so much heart ,Positive
2146,i absolutely loved the first avengers and guardians of the galaxy  but since then  most of the movies have just fell flat for me  shang chi on the other hand is exactly what i'd be hoping for  no overly complicated story lines with too many plot holes to count  this has great character development with people you actually feel sympathy for  natural comedic relief throughout  amazing fight scenes and fairly constant action without feeling forced  this is just a great super hero movie all around ,Positive
2147,the movie was one of the best movies that i have ever seen ,Positive
2148,this film us well written and directed  all the action sequences are well choreographed  this is an origin story but it will not give you marvel movie vibe(in a positive way) until and unless you will see the post credit scenes  yes  there are 2 credit scenes  simu liu and tony was the highlight of the movie  awkwafina has also performed well  her chemistry with simu was extraordinary and her comic timing was also perfect ,Positive
2149,watched the movie on release date and wasnt sure as i didnt see much advertisement on it  but i can say the movie was amazing  the characters casted worked well for the  but my favourite had to be trevor!!,Positive
2150,simply put  this movie was bland  plot follow a simple acceptance plot  of shang learning to accept he is his father's son  with no surprising twists or changes to the plot to make it better  shang himself seems to be watching everything instead of actually interacting with his world  action scenes were choreographed well  yet never seemed to fit for some reason  the ending was anticlimactic  and i expected more of a ending fight with the big bad  visually speaking the movie is gorgeous  but i wouldn't watch it for the visuals  shang as a character is bland and boring  the only character i felt was developed well was shang's father  side characters are forgettable  if you are a fan of the marvel cinematic universe  then don't watch it as it doesn't fit at all in the timeline  with excessive fantasy elements that don't fit in the universe  take this review with a grain of salt  as i went into this movie with higher expectations  but these are flaws i saw as i watched the film  thank you for your time ,Positive
2151,easily landed in my top 3 mcu films thus far  all the epic action and gorgeous cinematography you'd expect from a wuxia movie with a marvel budget  with great acting from leung and awkwafina and particular and rich references to chinese myth ,Positive
2152,best mcu movie ever best fight scene !!a different style of mcu movie ,Positive
2153,such a good movie  the asian representation is on point  if i could give this movie past a 10 star rating i would  can't wait for what else marvel has in store ,Positive
2154,"today i watched the movie ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings "" overall i quite enjoyed it  but there are a few things i believe could have been done better first of all there are the characters  shang chi himself i believe was lacking when it came to his personality  both xialing and katy had traits that were simple  interesting  and easy to follow  throughout the film shang chi goes from being a less extreme version of katy to a less extreme version of xialing  this causes him to be forgettable  as there is a more interesting character with the same personality in the film at all times  it would have been nice to see some of his own traits that are unique and fresh i think the development of the main heroes could have been more evenly spread across the whole film  as the only noticeable changes i witnessed were after they had reached the village i think it is also important to talk about shang chi's father  he was a very three dimensional character and i really enjoyed his interactions with his son during their final fight  the only thing i would have liked to change about him would be to see him be affected by his old age  surely being around for so long would give him some sort of wisdom  something that confused me was whether or not he was supposed to be redeemed in the end  as the way other characters felt about him was very inconsistent  while this could have been a fun concept to explore  seeing how his children felt about him and how unsure they were  it was not done correctly  their feelings changed quickly and it was not shown to us enough for it to be something the audience recognised the next thing i would like to talk about are the rings  they were confusing  inconsistent  and not explored enough  the abilities the rings possessed were not clear  in one scene xu wenwu will take down an army  then lose to one woman  though she was aided by her powers  many of the moves xu wenwu showed during the opening could have been used in many other situations during the film  the rings are built up to be something that can grant you god like powers  but they end up being underwhelming  it does not make sense that xu wenwu is not able to take down the ta lo army  the people of ta lo possess abilities granted to them by the great protector but these powers are never explained or shown  while not all things have to be explained  this movie had too many questions left unanswered  while the after credits scene alluded to an explanation of the rings' origins  i am looking at this movie as a standalone project  none of the magic is given an explanation  that includes the rings and the great protector my third point will be the plot and the execution of the whole film  the plot was not well done  many of the points were rushed and introduced very out of nowhere  these points include the introduction of trevor and morris  it was a little too convenient that they met someone who just happened to live with something from ta lo  and just happened to be able to understand it  and was also willing to help them  another thing would be the exposition  a few times during this film i felt as if a book was being read to me  there are better ways to tell a backstory than for a character to tell it to us directly  the death of shang chi's mother also seemed very random  it seemed as if it was not thought about at all  the gang that killed her was never mentioned before  and they were nor important to the plot in any way  so much so that they were shown to be killed not much after  i also feel it would have been better for shang chi and his friends to stay in ta lo for longer until his father shows up  this is because it would give katy time to learn about the bow and arrow much more realistically the climax  which would be when the dweller in darkness appears  the dweller is  like the rings  built up to be something very powerful and ends up being underwhelming  everything slightly before and after this was rushed  such as the introduction of the gate  which  like many things  was shown through a voice over  it had not been shown before this and we were not given the time to actually think about the dangers it may possess  the appearance of the great protector was also very random and  again  underwhelming lastly  the ending  it also made no sense for shang che to be able to defeat the dweller that easily  as his father  who had a thousand years to master them  was not able to  if he was also aided by the power of the dragon  this should have been stated  i do think the scene of everyone honoring the dead was done well  and was important for showing how much was sacrificed during the battle many of the problems i talked about could have been fixed with better timing  the right foreshadowing  better exposition  and more consistency  all in all i really enjoyed this film  though that may seem a little contradictory with how much i criticised it  i would recommend this film for anyone who enjoys cool action and cool visuals  also if you're looking for fun female characters  i would rate this movie a 7/10 ",Positive
2155,really good movie very immersive recommend it to all fans ,Positive
2156,great movie and one of the best superheroes in the mcu  very recommend to watch:),Positive
2157,shang chi is amazing  that's all i have to say purr ,Positive
2158,as an asian american  i am no stranger to the cliche martial art scenes and corniness of it all  i went in fully expecting everything about this movie to be cheesy and cliche like mulan was  boy  was i wrong! shang chi was so beautifully written  acted  and directed! i really want to give a huge shout out to the directors for their incorporation of asian culture into this movie without making everything a cliche or a punch line  i teared up watching people who looked like me be the main actors on a big screen and not the punch line of a joke now  onto the story  the story was alright  it wasn't the best  but it's an introductory movie to the hero so not much to expect there other than your typical hero introductory tropes the ost's of this movie were off the charts! i really enjoyed the music they had and think they nailed it need i say more about the acting? tony leung  sima liu  awkwafina  michelle yeoh   these are the best of the best for asian american actors and they nailed every scene they had in the movie!lastly  i absolutely loved the cinematography and the fight scenes  they were well thought out and choreographed  it didn't seem cheesy or corny  thank you marvel for making this movie and paying homage to asian americans  this movie will be one that i will never forget!,Positive
2159,this film is only great of its visual  just like any other marvel films  plot and the actors are boring  even the marvel miniseries were way better than this crap  all the high ratings are most probably done by asians!! they just want their asian faces to be highly rated  even the lead actor were pushing marvel to do an asian superhero  my questions is why only the chinese  korean  japanese are considered as asians? why cant be the indians  indonesians  mongolian or country like kuwait and others be main lead as asians?,Positive
2160,i have seen almost every marvel movie  and so far this is the only one i plan to rewatch  it's just a little bit of a shame tony leung's character dies so we won't be seeing him in the mcu anymore ,Negative
2161,it's a really good superhero movie  marvel doesn't disappoint  as always a little deus ex machina at the end spoiled it a bit for me but it's not a big deal ,Positive
2162,decent action fantasy adventure  the asian twist give s it an uplift with over the top razzle dazzle however the shang chi storyline unfortunately is definitely not from the comics  pretty disappointed as shang chi is very sombre chaacter who is at war with his father fu manchu who is a scheming powerful scary dude  the conflict between them is epic and forms the basis of the core of the storyline dont think shang chi is a required not relevant chanracter in this movie  the requirement is just for an action hero  seems like marvel ran out of ideas how to introduce shang chi to the audience ,Positive
2163,"loved the way how the story revolves around shang chi
it's like a fantasy journey to his world
and the actions are super satisfying  can't wait to see them on next avenger film ",Positive
2164,this movie is a great introduction to the character and has a pretty epic ending  looking forward to seeing more of shang chi!,Positive
2165,i like this movie very much  the action fighting is very good ,Positive
2166,it is   impressive! not because of the narrative which is pretty normal  nor the performance which is somewhat above average  it is impressive for the proper use of elements from chinese myth when the crew arrived the hidden talo village  it is such wow! the mythical animals are exactly what i image them to be  the long(dragon)  feng (fire bird)  kirin  nine tail fox  it feels like they just came out of the chinese mythical stories that passed down from generation to generation and the kong fu too! the use of tai chi movement is smart  combining with the natural magic  the visual presentation is great! it is definitely a good movie for kong fu fans the narrative is not bad  the legendary villain gave up everything for a beautiful girl  they lived happy life until his wife was killed during his enemy's vengeance  the miss of his wife led him to break the portal that blocks powerful alien monster  his son  inherited the power from both him and his wife  found his way to defeat the villain and the monster  the world turns to peace once again!overall  7 star for the narrative and performance  1 additional star for the kongfu and another for the mythical elements  absolutely love those animals!,Positive
2167,action packed and adventurous  a must see  i look forward to seeing more of their stories and how they'll fit into the marvel universe with other heroes ,Positive
2168,this movie had everything from a great story to some of the best visuals i've ever seen shang chi has elevated the already high expectations from the mcu moving forward ,Positive
2169,the cgi was great but apart from it everything is just ok at the best  it didn't connect with any character at all  to be honest wait for the film to come on streaming services  not worth it to go to the cinema  the storyline was kind of confusing ,Positive
2170,the movie had the most absolutely beautiful fight scenes  the hand to hand combat was amazing  unfortunately the ending was a cgi boss fight scene  i wished it was more combat rather than a magic battle that marvel does ,Positive
2171,i really enjoyed the film  i thought that it was emotional just as it was funny and will most likely see again!,Positive
2172,as an asian i would not like this filmthe choice of character  do they truly represent china or other asian culture? if a chinese or other asian watches this  would they like them just like americans and europeans would feel for the character of iron man or thor?the mandarin talk sounds very strange for people who really speak and understand chinese i can see it is trying to put in some asian  or at least chinese bits in  like the water map  the bamboo       but it is still unable to achieve what we might think is beautiful  but for westerns  it's fine to show as this is asian style ,Positive
2173,first of all i have to say that the action sequences of this movie were great and it's cinematography was on point  the real mandarin aka shang chi's father is easily the best marvel villain for me  plus it was refreshing to see the ten rings in action  the story was good but i wish there were some changes in the script to make the movie more interesting as it got a bit slow in the second half  the climax was a bit dramatic  there were some moments which could have been better if the script was right  in the end as a marvel fan it's a great film but as a superhero fan who isn't really into particular studio can find this movie an okayish one ,Positive
2174,as a chinese audience i feel awkward and weird then i realized this movie is totally not for me  it's for westerners  so i quit and left by the way i hate kung fu panda  too  panda looks so ugly in it ,Negative
2175,watched this today and really enjoyed it! recommend seeing it  without saying too much  as a woman and mom  the real hero was the sister  and even my husband in the end thought the heroism would be shared  rings n all  but nope  that was disappointing ,Positive
2176,"*spoilers below*shang chi is an interesting installation in the mcu  because it introduces fresh elements that bring an exciting performance to screen  and then turns right around and bogs itself down by reminding you that it is still a marvel movie  it is an interesting dichotomy that i feel highlights the glaring issues in the mcu right now starting off with what i like: the performances in this movie are top notch  tony leung's as the main antagonist is by far one of my favorite mcu villain iterations in recent history  which is also a point of frustration as well  but i will get into that later  the choreography of the fight sequences deserve every praise they receive and the narratives of living up to the expectations of your family along with a family all trying to deal with the grief of loss makes for one of the more compelling stories that marvel has told in some time what i didn't like: tony leung's character has arguably one of the more compelling villain stories in the mcu  he's not just an evil asshole looking to dominate the world  he's a grieving widow  and the relationship with his children become entangled with and complicated by his overwhelming grief  so why marvel once again chose to continue perpetuating this cycle of killing off their villains i do not understand in this instance the point in the movie where it switches from action packed fighting choreography to cgi battle royale monster slaying is where i genuinely think the movie loses a lot of the progress it made by trying to be something different  it hits the exact same troupes of marvel movies past  and not in a good way  shang chi's conflict with his father was the most engaging plot point of the movie  and then slows down right into ""psychic demon eating dimension bad must now stop"" some of the exposition  particularly in the middle  is a bit excessive  there was probably at least a solid 15 20 minutes that they could have shaved off the run time overall  it is still a fun time to be had  if you love the mcu  this is likely a film that you will thoroughly enjoy  it shines best when it tries not to be a marvel film  but then unfortunately finds it's way right back into business as usual ",Positive
2177,"if you've watched aquaman (which was pretty mediocre) then you'd see a lot of similarities with shang chi  the hero origin story formula is plain and simple  i don't know why it's that hard to copy/paste    
spoiler
a guy who is ""chosen""  living in a world that's not his own => mad about mom dying when he's young=> get hunt down by a relative and their armies => discover mystical homeland => inherit powerful weapon => win  cause menit was uninspired and for the most part  very boring  i didn't care for the main characters as they had no personality (even for katy) nor motivation  the jokes were hit or miss  and most were not timed well  the villains were   acting: 3/10
action: 5/10
plot: 1/10
vfx: 3/10
fashion: 4/10overall: 2/10  a disservice to marvel fans and the asian community ",Negative
2178,this was by far the most boring mcu title i've seen to date  it was basically two hours of the same fight scene done over and over  i really hope this isn't indicative of the direction the mcu is headed post endgame ,Negative
2179,superb superb superb very very good movie must watch in theatre    ,Positive
2180,this movie was all around amazing  the visuals were amazing  it was a very heartfelt story and simu liu's and tony leung's performances were truly extraordinary i didn't give it 10 stars because the final battle felt a little underwhelming in comparison to the rest of the movie (something i have noticed is a common theme in marvel movies) would honestly give it a 9 5 ,Positive
2181,a beautiful movie! it has really created a great start to the movies of phase 4 in marvel  definitely see this! you will not regret it! this is the part that contains spoilers  it was such a twist when trevor slattery came with his buddy morris  if you have disney plus rewatch iron man 3 before seeing it ,Positive
2182,the pacing was awful  the movie was so slow  it needed more fight  fight is good  the fight seemed like it was on 2 times speed  it was just meh  would not recommend  meh ,Negative
2183,a good start to the fourth phase  not counting the black widow ,Positive
2184,i loved watching this and everyone was well cast katy was very funny with shang chi and the plot was great if i could re cast anyone it would definitely be shang chi's dad as jackie chan i feel he coulda really done well in that role ,Positive
2185,the visual effects combined with the martial arts looked very pleasing and well executed  another new world of fantasies and mystical creatures was enthralling  the plot was quite compelling given the dark history of shang chi's father  the story around his parents' was well done too  it's a great addition to the marvel universe  as well as the action genre ,Positive
2186,this movie is a must see  i walked into the theatre really not expecting much  somewhat expecting it to be a corny movie filled with asian stereotypes  god was i wrong! this movie beautifully captured cultural nuances that touched a deep part of me as a chinese canadian  the movie also featured seasoned actors in chinese martial arts movies including michelle yeoh and tony leung   brings back childhood memories  the cinematography was wonderful as always  but the plot was surprisingly touching  also can we talk about how fire the soundtrack is! 10/10 ,Positive
2187,amazing cast amazing fighting scenes and an interesting story one of marvels finest!,Positive
2188,i just don't understand why this flick got such high ratings  you can go crazy with special effects but if the acting is poor and the attempts to bring some humor u can trow this whole concept in the bin  the humor is what makes me connect with the actor's in most of the marvel films  this was really lame as and it made me want to leave the theater everytime a lame ass attempt to have some sort of funny dialogue  the main characters are not very strong characters  most of the dialogue was annoying  i just don't understand other reviews and why this film is rated so good  its not only about special effects ,Positive
2189,good movie! i enjoyed watching it! what a good movie! good! movie!,Positive
2190,it is amazing marvel movie it is some different things from regular marvel movies i like so much you must have was this one ,Positive
2191,"this movie blew me away as i had recently watched black widow and was thuroughly disappointed as the movie left much to be desired  i understand that the movie was rushed and was planned to come out during 2020 but it still felt like a disappointment  anyways  this isn't about black widow  this movie blew me away with great cgi and amazing acting  the comedy relief of katy and trevor was great to see because it combined with the action perfectly  the actors were great  the fighting was great and looked like a dancers life work and practice  the storyline was perfect and the character and wolrd building was on point highly recommended  please watch!tl:dr
black widow sucks and this movie was great in every aspect ",Positive
2192,the first part of the movie is great  i mean i like the scene where shang chi's father met mother  it was a beautiful story but then  everything is disappointing from that point i am confused about the storyline  why would shang chi escape and left his sister ? its not like his dad is abusing him  he trained to become an assassin to avenge his mother at his will  he trained until his fist is bloody at his will too  at this point  no concrete reason why he would escape as his father is not abusive towards him too  he can just watched his mother died to protect them  yeah hes not guilty for that  and he said hes gonna kill his father ?yeah right  again no concrete reason simu liu is great with comedic scenes but remains stoic in the sentimental scenes  it is really hard to see him as marvel heroes as his facial expression and vibes does not support that  no father son chemistry too with his father  tony leung  think his acting is overshadowed by tony leung also father just die like that  no sentimental scenes whatsoever  shang chi even seems relieved his father is gone ,Positive
2193,this movie has a great storyline and a ton of action pack scenes  i'd watch this movie again but the trailers exposed too much  overall this was a great movie and deserves 700+ million box office ,Positive
2194,it doesnt feel like a marvel movie at all!! didnt like the movie    felt like watching fantastic beasts and where to find them!! boring storyline ,Negative
2195,was fun until pokemons showed up  should have stuck to martial arts ,Positive
2196,this movie has made me realise how useful history is  this movie will be remembered more then ww2  this is so amazing  i want to marry this movie ,Positive
2197,such a beautiful movie  everything is great  i'm usually not a huge fan of fighting sequences  but let me tell you  this movie is different  everything about shang chi gets you hooked  the actors are doing a great job  and the storyline is just spectacular  it's like those crazy ideas you think of  before realizing it's a little too chaotic  this movie does that  but makes it good and executable  the only thing i'd change about the movie is the vfx  don't get me wrong  they're quite the vision  but they don't look too realistic  all in all  still a solid 9/10 ,Positive
2198,my daughter urged me to watch this movie as i usually don't watch super hero movies  i was nicely surprised and deeply touched  crying while wearing a mask was uncomfortable and kinda funny  thank goodness i didn't miss this one if you haven't watched it  please go  the sound track itself is outstanding ,Positive
2199,very well scripted for the character shang chi  this is marvel's first character which is introduced beautifully movie is perfect blend of action+visual effects+locations+music  each characters are awesome in their performance  however  role of death dealer could be more in the movie  but it's ok visual effects are omg! marvel's best visual effect till the time in this movie  action sequences are really amazing and you will love it  background music of the movie really enjoyable  each scene has special music allotted so definitely you will enjoy full movie with it's uniqueness ,Positive
2200,i was marveling at this movie it was a marvelous there was a very funny dance choreography scene children under 17 should not watch  because there is a violence  the characters were not following covid protocol  so brave  stay strong soldiers ,Positive
2201,it was boring and predictable  first time i've ever been misled by imdb rating ,Negative
2202,it's an amazing start for the first asian american superhero movie  i think the leading actor (simu liu) really needs to improve  many emotions are not complete  without his father  he could not sustain the film ,Positive
2203,you should see this movies mcu was giving some boeing movies but this is out of mind ,Neutral
2204,"the movie feels rich in general; it feels steeped in culture  elements of chinese culture brought to stunning life with bits and pieces of backstory filled in via deftly deployed flashback  furthermore  the storyline is poignant and heartbreaking; you feel for wenwu  the acclaimed ""villian"" and his quest not for world dominance or anything else petty but instead to save the life of his wife  who he believes is trapped in a pocket dimension  there was also not a single character out of place  awkwafina was a rare sidekick that provided comedic relief at the beginning of the film  transitioning into an integral part of the final conflict and partner for shang chi  this storyline is distinct in its nature to focus on the development of familial bond and all of the characters  showing that each character is complex and layered  ++ (one of my favourite scenes was during shang chi's quest to stop his father from inadvertently releasing a demonic  soul eating monster on the world  the cinematography accurately juxtaposed the tension between shang chi and his father against the still atmosphere of the backdrop  making us understand wenwu's heartbreak though his actions are reprehensible  a part of us still wants to believe in his cause of action  )however  the filmography for shang chi's fight was a little disappointing  from the slanted angle of sweeping foot here to the breathless acrobatics of a flip there that dances between life and death  it is apparent that shang chi shows its awareness to do that  but falls short in showing a real sense of stake that were grounded and tactile  for example  during the fight between wenwu and leiko  scenes of their fights were slowed down at parts  not for the sake of magnifying the fight between them but rather for a sense of coolness  not only does this make the scene feel crafted artificially  it downplays the experience of physicality that it could have bring to the viewers  hence  its ambition to become a kung fu marvel movie became a marvel movie w kung fu in it :(nonetheless  shang chi n the legend of ten rings was a martial arts fantasy that provided wit  heart and action to spare ",Positive
2205,the best marvel movie ive ever seen! the fight scenes were so good  i couldn't take my eyes of the screen the whole time  the dad was also very attracitve! i recommend this movie 100%,Positive
2206,a marvel movie that is not just about action and graphic gimmicks beautifully shot  emotional story telling with great universal themes of family i'm not usually a marvel fanboy  however i recommend this film!,Positive
2207,i really don't like marvel movies or science fiction movies  but surprisingly i really liked the movie because there was a lot of humour in the movie  only the end was a bit disappointing because it was only science fiction then  in the beginning it was still a little realistic  the movie was also a bit too long  not too much variation either  it was the first marvel movie i've watched and i would surely watch one again  but it isn't really my cup of tea and it aren't movies i would watch all the time ,Positive
2208,i don't get how this flick got such rave reviews  so overrated it's not even funny  i rated this movie at 6 and i think that may even be a bit too generous ,Positive
2209,for me that was the marvel movie of the year  it is so good in every point  visual effects  martial arts fight scenes that i loved  cast  the landscapes  story and direction  soundtrack and so on i was not expecting that good but  when i watch it  i was impressedi recommend the movie for everyone ,Positive
2210,some movies recieve unfair treatdsment bout eir favor because they are star a minority character  a good example of this would be black panther  i enjoyed that film  but saying it was one of the best is overstating it  but if you dare criticize it  you will be called a racist and ignored  we should be able to criticize films regardless of the stars race  (by the way  i loved chadwick boseman's performance  may he rest in peace) yet  this film deserves praise  not only for the asian repricentation  but for it's refreshing new plot  the way that it sets up in the past  gets down to earth and then gets magical again  which gets me very exited for eternals i personally watched the film in 4dx  which really improves the experiance of the opening scene  and the rest of the movie to the movie was great over all  let's hope marvel keeps it up like this ,Positive
2211,"apologies for draining mandarin in ""iron man 3"" arrived late in the marvel team  well  in full length format  at least  true  and here everything is sad again  and also fabulous  just like warner's neighbors  however  even those have a relatively gloomy fantasy world than a film about a mysterious terrorist organization known as ""ten rings""   from which the marvel cinematic universe began and what they fooled our heads about  if you like    hinted in other films  the marvelites should not lag behind anyone or anything  so it was necessary to burn down their magical world without blackjacks and strangers  but with a variety of creatures  including  his mother  dragons (not a mother  although we will see the mother of dragons)  the mandarin or simply xu wenwu  thanks to the magic rings (and it is not known who he is to remove the rings) conquered the lands for centuries until he got tired of it  at the end of the last century  he began searching for a certain mysterious village  in which  according to legend  many mythical animals live  however  at the entrance he met love  with which he performed something like a dance  after which they got married and lived happily (this is not an indian movie!)  the worlds of ""flying daggers"" and ""mood for love"" converged   at this sweet moment it was possible to finish the film  but it was not there the sweet story turned into children and a sudden death  after which dad decided to raise a stern karate kid and a worthy successor  copying oldboy in places  however  he grew up and merged into fashionable san francisco  where he hung out with not the most pleasant girl performed by aquafina  marvel is too fond of keeping up with trends  and where necessary  socialist china will be represented by paradise  and women will rule the world  which is done so ostentatiously and unnaturally that it evokes the opposite feeling of tolerance  first  the most powerful person on earth is defeated in a battle with a villager  then a sister beats her brother  and another villager commands everyone  giving orders (well  we also watch the second scene after the credits  if we have enough patience)  no one asks the conditional aunt luda to stand at the stove all day  although if there were such a lady in the mcu  she would acquire an army or at least keep a barrel under an apron  but a sense of proportion is sometimes a necessary thing  and aquafina  shang chi's girlfriend  is responsible for a simple girl  but her heroine infuriates more than all the others put together due to poor humor  which has already turned into a kind of marvel style or even a cliche  when a serious and even tragic story needs something yes  dilute so that the kids do not get bored  but sitting on all the chairs at once is extremely difficult shang chi  or in the world  sean  as expected  has to return to his native land in order to confront the same notorious ghosts of the past  of course  the irritable companion leaves everything and everyone  rushing after him  as expected  he finds himself in his mother's native land  where a custom made fashionable hero costume  as well as dance lessons  awaits him  and  of course  everything turns into another sterile mess (although the russo brothers with a pg 13 rating did more interesting things)  as if conveying ardent greetings to the black panther finale  and there are a bunch of other films  we've seen all of this a hundred times already  as well as the hero going crazy after losing his wife  and all these mythical creatures and serious fights would be appropriate if marvel set the right tone  alas and ah   everything turned into a continuous and familiar buffoonery  where there was even a place for sir ben kingsley  who was again given to play a fool  because one fool is not enough for a film  maybe the picture will delight the chinese  and they will fall from laughter under the chairs of cinemas from so many clichés and cranberries  but they are probably already accustomed to this  and only openly yawn  they say  they have not seen this  and all this half epic will again be trolled in the conditional ""avengers 5""  although no   the marvelites have already successfully done this by the end of the film  because the tragedy is not a tragedy  that the epic battle is ridiculous  but the brutal thanos  meanwhile  is already completely obscene in the parallel running animated series ""what if    ""
the main problem of marvel is an unsuccessful attempt to please everyone  and at the same time a careless attitude towards projects like shang chi  which stand apart  that is  they are not particularly tied to the global plot of the mcu  even if they are referring to it with all their might  and the most offensive thing is that there was some potential  the idea could really turn into something more entertaining  but not in this mcu  probably  such films often act as a kind of postcard and agenda supporting the brand's status  and popular brands must adhere to certain frameworks and ideologies  which is self censorship  which is more harmful than the other way around  they shoot films every three or four times   the same ""avengers""  in which there is a lot of action and a much more global plot  and special effects that are needed  after all  the audience always wants more  which is why all the bets on films like ""the multiverse of madness"" and ""no way home""   the main thing is not to drain the good old villains there  or even  you see  spiderman  but ""shang chi"" respect only for the glorious ""hotel california"" ",Positive
2212,this films gets points for a few things; a great amount of asian representation  quality fight choriography and the little fluff ball with wings beyond that  the writing is run of the mill and overly expositional  the acting is okay at best and there is some b movie grade cgi mixed in with avergae quality cgi ,Positive
2213,this is not a superhero movie  it's more of a kungfu chinese hero genre  would prefer more mcu tech  less fantasy 'dragon' and mystical creatures cgis  which are weird when set in a earth based context ,Positive
2214,this is a very good film  definitely in the upper half of the marvel film charts  however there are a few plot inconsistencies and the story could have been a bit more involving  overall though  a solid film ,Positive
2215,so bad  between this and eternals  marvel is in big trouble  marvel seems to have given up on any overarching story now that avengers is over and will instead focus on creating woke nonsense over and over ,Negative
2216,i am so happy that i watched this in the cinema! i found it really funny  perfect balance of serious and amusing  the mandarin speaking makes the film feel so much more authentic  the amount of films i have watched that are set in another country but start speaking english  it makes them feel unrealistic  again  this film is amazing and is worth your time ,Positive
2217,the story telling of this movie is good and all the characters in this movie have done their job well specially shang  chi father  his fighting moves and the vfx are created well  overall best solo movie of marvel ,Positive
2218,"for a more than 2h fim it is ok  good pace  nice visual effects  nice fights (not too long) and blah blah     i enjoyed the film so i noted based on thatbut i've learn something in it:
1) asians don't mix with white people in us  not even talk to them 2) white guys are only bad guys (not even bus drivers or streamers   )
3) a woman never loses a fightshould i be surprised?",Positive
2219,was so boring i almost fell asleep  i dont not get why people rate it as a 10  it was not even close to a 10  it was missing so much marvel comedy and the action was boring  its more like a 5 5  and he blew up that monster easy  like whats going on in this movie  it was so hard to follow the story too  like i said  almost fell asleep ,Negative
2220,great vfx and cinematography but lacks in storyline  cliche and highly predictable  one time watch  expected a lot but ended up in disappointment   but as the first asian superhero movie  this has done a fair job ,Positive
2221,the film brings a lot of callbacks to previous marvel movies  making it feel like a homecoming of sorts  it's filled with lots of impressive set pieces  starting with a thrilling bus sequence ,Positive
2222,such a bad movie    it is like harry potter plus dr  strange    and yeah  the father is so evil  it needs his children who are americanized to beat him  and yeah  the girl who was american born chinese also was great    she can learn archery for one day and be an olympic gold medalist    so awesome    the whole movie is like it was written by a 22 year old now marvel has two sucking movies in a row    black widow and shang chi    selling the disney stocks   ,Positive
2223,"an awesome movie must watch
storyline was really good and action was extremely mind blowing and love the acting actors were fabulous wont regret after watching this beauty ",Positive
2224,disclaimer: i am big fan of leung chiu wai and chinese kung fu movie (people fight in air with inner chi kind of stuff)when i watched shang chi i can feel the combination of raya and the last dragon with mcu jokes  plus chinese kung fu oldies  which is not a bad thing  my most favourite fighting scenes in mcui enjoy every sences in this movie  it's shallow but enjoyable  super easy to digest and to predict  we just have to keep in mind that we are watching a super hero movie that base on comic book  how deep you would like it to be  right?,Positive
2225,what a movie 🔥🔥 must watch i was waiting for this movie to release on ott platform and after it released today on disnep hotstar i watched it just now and i must tell you shang chi did a great job very good superhero movie👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻,Positive
2226,worst movie i've ever watched in my entire life  cgi was trash  story was trash  cinematic was trash  actors and actresses were trash  the whole setting was trash  didn't deserve the hype it gets  trash ,Negative
2227,this movie is based heavily on chinese culture  as half the movie is in chinese (with english subtitles of course)  only people who speak chinese can fully enjoy the movie  i highly suggest any chinese american who speaks chinese or any people with immigrant culture in their families to watch  the movie is super relatable and by far the best i have seen ,Positive
2228,shang chi is best movie story  i like this story  simu lu as shanu is best actor  katy is best funny story  i like shanu's father is ten ring of blue  it's beautiful nature and best effects ,Positive
2229,i was so excited to see this movie then i find out everything is subtitles if i wanted to read a book i'll go read a book i paid to watch a movie and i don't even know what's going on because i have to read a damn book could not even enjoy the special effects have no idea what the actress look like because all i get to do is read horrible if i could give it less than a star i would give it ,Negative
2230,though it was good  the climax wasted it all  shang chi had never used the rings before  and he  after almost dying  while fighting his father and trying to save the world  in intense pressure  controlled the rings even better than his father who had been practically practicing for hundreds of years! this makes no sense  this is probably the most incoherent thing marvel has ever done in an mcu movie i think marvel also missed the opportunity to tie this with eternals  they could show that the monsters are actually deviants  shang chi couldn't stop them  and then eternals came to stop them  that would've been great ,Positive
2231,"awful   
it was very disappointed   
actor and actress are not attractive very childish ~
no more shangchi    
please   
or changes everything and everyone ",Negative
2232,incredibly disappointed in the film  instead of adding to the great marvel empire the film belongs in a disney cartoon the character'katy' adds no benefit to the story line  with very poorly performed / written jokes and she only takes away from the sisters story and highlight characters  the ending of the film was incredibly predictable and i hope they do not continue the story line in future marvel films despite the final scenes ,Negative
2233,the plot was very naive  there is no real connection between the brothers or between the father and his children  and if you ganna convince me that the father is the evil man so you need to let him do terrible thing  going to the secret village was my worst part  the way the reached there and the village it self  is they a thousand year civilization and way most of them are old men and women  thay must save the gate and fight horrible creatures and there are more ,Negative
2234,i don't know if it's because it was the first movie i saw in theaters since covid  but i absolutely love this movie  it's an amazing movie that gets you excited throughout the whole film ,Positive
2235,i loved it  beautiful movie  loved the martial arts  the story  and it was quite funny too! my favorite scene was the fighting scene on the bus  i watched it twice already  highly recommend ,Positive
2236,amazing  it needs to be at least 150 characters so i'm trying to fill in the space but it's really good  i love it the actors and the plot it's funny just watch it i don't know what to say anymore but watch it why not it's on disney plus ,Positive
2237,bad acting  just bad acting all over  not any just one  meh to bad fight scenes  bad final fight  rough start for the first movie of the new era  but that's fine if the rest are good ,Negative
2238,this movie is both boring and pointless  do not know how it got such a high score on rotten tomatoes  but it was 2 hours of my lie i will never get back  do not watch tis garbage unless you hate yourself ,Negative
2239,did anyone notice that people who kidnapped tony stark in the first iron man movie called themselves as the ten rings?great movie  tho  can't wait for some action from shang chi ,Positive
2240,the film was very interesting and captivating  especially with those visual effects  it's a superhero movie that starts with the story of the main character shang chi who has a father who is a kind of ancient villain but he meets the character's mother  they have him and the story goes on  i don't want to give too many spoilers  i recommend this movie but especially if you like marvel movies ,Positive
2241,"great story  great fx  great acting why 6/10 then?because they insist on dropping in gangster rap and other hollywood bs
because the overused generic dramatic moozak
because they watered it down to fit disney standards ",Positive
2242,shang shi and the legend of the ten rings is definitely pretty high up on my mcu list  a lot because of it's really well directed action sequences  in a lot of previous mcu fight scenes it can be kind of hard to even tell what is going on half the time  but in shang shi  not only are some of the fight scenes really interesting like that one scene on the bus where we get that continuous shot of shang shi moving up the bus through a bunch of people  or the scene where they're attacked on the side of the building and half to climb down this thing  jumping and swinging around it  also  the movie looks awesome at some times  and it's kinda' like a light show  the special effects look great  and the movie is well directed  and fun to watch really the only problem i have with movie are just smaller  like the movie kinda' slows down toward the middle  there's also that scene toward the end of the movie  where we see him flashing back to his mom getting taken away  which seems kinda' useless and just to dramatize everything before we reach the big climax but other than that  the movie is totally worth the watch and i highly recommend it ,Positive
2243,the worst marvel movie ever  or even the worst movie i ever watched  a chinese culture movie showing no respect to chinese culture lol  another solid proof that hollywood doesn't have the capability for a good movie with chimes elements  a mixed up with all kinds of cheesy plots and poor imitations from other movies  i bet marvel only spent 1/10 budgets of spiderman3 on this one  a total waste of time!!!,Negative
2244,"omg  i just loved every second of it especially the part where shang chi defeated the souls sucker monster 😍
chef kissed
it's been long time that i haven't watched such an awesome movie from marvel since the last avengers ",Positive
2245,very generic chinese movie with cringy scenes and generic plot  although there were some good soundtracks and action scenes  i would have been angry if i paid to see this in the theaters  i guess it's alright to watch if you are going to pay a couple bucks  but don't expect anything crazy ,Negative
2246,the plot is as predictable as other predictable movies  so there's nothing interesting to expect  except for the acting of tony leung chiu wai and the funny moments of awkwafina  they saved the movie  the kungfu is good and beautiful  anyway  i felt asleep sometimes  so the movie is ok for watching at home  not at the movie theater ,Positive
2247,low and repaid movies marvel!story easy and low film director no good  actor is not pro no good movie no hero china the shang chi and legend of the ten rings rings is blue and rings orange color rings in the movie shang chi and legend of the ten rings ,Negative
2248,the goal of an mcu solo film is to sell the audience on a new character and power system  this movie does both perfectly  within the first 30 minutes we are drawn to shang as a character and that lasts throughout the entire movie  the fight scenes have love and care poured into them and i hope they bring this team back for future mcu movies involving shang because they pay homage to old kung fu movies beautifully ,Positive
2249,movie is cool   but they could've at least gave him a better costume  like come on man  they too was all cool and stuff then just killed it with regular black pants and he literally had on jordan 1s  a pair of toms would've made that look better!,Positive
2250,so  i guess film makers from the us still think chinese people will buy their shiiiit when they put kungfu  mandarin  famous chinese actors/actresses together i don't get why black panther get so successful  and black lives matter movement still happened 2 years after the movie    can't you guys see the more movies like black panther got successful the stronger white supreme will be  cuz your anger is released by the movies made by whites  movies like mulan and this shang chi(it's shang qi  get yourself educated) are like fossils from 20 years ago  unfortunately  the world has moved on ,Positive
2251,"i'm really not a fan of ""awkwafina"" and the racial stereotyping she represents  that's her whole schtick: she plays a caricatural racial stereotype  one that is apparently meant to elicit laughter in some quarters she's a caricature of a racial stereotype the way aunt jemima or black boy lawn decorations were   perhaps endearing to some  but quite an unappealing and cringe worthy racial stereotype to others and what's with having a director of japanese background in charge of a movie about a chinese character? i'm guessing some movie executives figured ""what's the difference  they're all the same to us ""sure the two countries are more or less in the same geographic proximity  and the people have some similar appearance  at least to outsiders  but the cultures are quite different and the two countries aren't even exactly on the best of terms so that's like putting an israeli director in charge of a movie about syria or iran  a british director in charge of a movie about france  or a turkish director in charge of a movie about greece this is probably the marvel movie that i enjoyed the least  and i certainly don't understand the imdb rating that somehow shows 7 5 at the moment   it is most definitely not worth anywhere near that not impressed ",Positive
2252,"the movie is so full of plot holes i lost count  u could remove the romantic interest and the sister and it would have no impact on the movie  that's how bland and unimpactful they were the main character is yet another ""trained at a young age with daddy issues"" character the main villain is ""dark beings"" who swallow souls  the only reason i'll give it a 3 is because of the visuals  even tho some of them  like the one were they run on the dragon or when he jumps through the bus  the laws of physics suddenly doesnt applythrashy movie honestly ",Positive
2253,"i'm not the kind of guy who exaggerate reviews just for showing off my film culture  i just want to know if a movie is worth my time without overthinking aka watching it at 10 pm when i'm suppose to sleep (usually 6 7/10 movies)in that case i don't think shang chi fulfill this role because the plot and the characters are whether annoying / ""cliché"" or predictable (even with the great combat scenes) so not a terrific film for the average user who had seen a lot movies in the genre ",Positive
2254,nice movie  i had seen more than 5 times the first half of the film is better  and i liked it much more than i was expecting  it's a strong debut for a new hero  injecting diverse blood into the mcu in a way that does not feel forced or hollow  i just think the overall film is still less than the sum of its more outstanding parts ,Positive
2255,the whole madarins of the movie are wired  chinese will never speak like that  i think they just translated english lines to chinese with google  3 stars for actions  hong kong action director is always reliable ,Positive
2256,"marvel shang chi review
pros: 
the fight scenes in this movie are next level cool
weapons and costume design is really good
plus shang chi's sisters ka weapon is really badass
this movie is really cool and doesn't take itself too seriously
this is a really fun movie with great fight scenes
personally  i didn't like katy that much but it's my personal opinion and not a problem
shang chi is really badass but his dad is my fav character in the whole movie
he really cool and i'm really impressed from his dad
i think plot is really cool aur the way shang chi's rings connect with kamar taj is also fascinating(anything related to doctor strange is cool)
seeing the ten rings in fights and other scenes is just really cool
shang chi's cgi is mind blowing aur in the last fight  the cgi was just brilliant
cons: 
the ending was really cliche and generic
it's was almost anticlimactic  like if it was just too easy
shang chi is a great movie besides the ending  (it's ending was really similar to aquaman's end)
shang chi's sister was a really cool character and it was a shame because her role in the film is frighteningly less
but besides the ending  there aren't a lot of faults in the movie
overall shang chi: 8/10
if the ending would have been a bit unpredictable and just a little cooler  it would have been a 9 5/10
but overall it's a good movie that i would suggest watching ",Positive
2257,while moving away from the main storyline this movie doenst feel like a quick cash grab but a full fledge story with lots of work and study behind  the universe gets even more depth when we notice the references to tradicional chinese culture even in the middle of the fight scenes its possible to notice reference to chinese dramas where we have long flight moments when the receive some kind of impact  so yeah where is the second movie ,Positive
2258,really great action scenes and fight choreography  it felt like an anime movie  the characters are likable  the casting fit the characters well  i'm looking forward to the next shang chi movie ,Positive
2259,"hello
one of the best movies of this year
i really enjoyed watching and i wish to see more of it maybe the 2 and 3 of this movie please
wish you the best and the luck for more  
thanks keep the hard work ",Positive
2260,shang chi and the legend of the ten idin of the most interesting films  telling about the adventure of an asian born super hero in the marvel cinematic universe  the main character is waiting for a large number of secrets concerning his family  together with their friends  they go in search of the truth  i advise you to watch this movie picture  she will not let you get bored during the entire session  the convulsions and dynamic scenes going back to the time of old china are very well demonstrated ,Positive
2261,"in the last year  disney has been leaning on chinese cuisine  ""mulan""  ""raya and the last dragon""  and now ""shang chi and the legend of the ten rings""  the set of ingredients is surprisingly similar: we collect time tested techniques and plot elements  throw them into a pile  upload them to the neural network and create a script  good savings come out during the pandemic  you don't have to pay the screenwriters  in any case  i do not want to believe that these three projects had real licensed screenwriters  otherwise i will have to put up with the complete degeneration of the profession under the control of disney  all three films are united by both the mentioned secondary nature and a disregard for the created world  the main thing is to introduce more mascotics to sell toys  and inclusivity  so that the press splashes with saliva  and the plot is for some strange people outside the target audience  the new film of the marvel cinematic universe almost fell victim to many factors  the same scenario   it is bad  predictable  consists of everything that any viewer  whether he is a movie fan or just getting acquainted with cinema  has seen if not hundreds  then at least dozens of times  in the center  the main character is of asian origin  living a quiet american life  but finding himself embroiled in a showdown of supernatural forces directly related to his past  he travels to different locations  meets his father  the villain  fights with him  and in the end reveals all his powers and enters into a confrontation with an older evil  unless the main character does not turn into mark dakaskas  as in the tv series ""killers of wu""  but otherwise everything is like in a multi series with iko yuvais  the second problem is the characters  malomal charisma is possessed only by supporting actors and beyond  in the foreground  you have to look at the one dimensional sima liu and aquafina (the young lady compensates for the lack of charisma with zero acting and tantrums)  even the beauty zhang menger managed to depersonalize  age  and in the second half of the film completely deprive of replicas  59 year old tony leung has to carry drama and pathos  and 77 year old ben kingsley has to carry humor  and what can you do if young people can't cope? however  two absolutely important problems are destroyed at the click of the infinity gauntlet when old chinese militants come into play  they were lovingly cut into fragments and filled to the brim with the possibilities of modern cinema  here's a fight on the bus  but on bamboo scaffolding   we have repeatedly seen all this at the same jackie chan  however  add to this a modern budget  special effects and the ability to shoot from almost any angle and get a completely new impression of the old as the world of movie fights  yes  as in the script  it's just tracing paper from repeatedly passed and digested  but with what a soul it is recreated! the action in ""shang chi"" is the best and most memorable part of the film  ideally  one day i would like to see an ""anti director version"" of the tape  where the entire plot and dialogues will be cut out  leaving 40 50 minutes of enjoyment for the eyes  it would be possible to continue to scold the film by putting a lower rating  but it will not work   the beauty of fights almost without firearms is enough here so that the movie does not upset  but on the contrary  awakens the belief that the most inclusive phase of the mcu will be better than it seems at the moment  it's not worth waiting for miracles from the plot of the upcoming tapes right now  but at least it surprises the directors at least sometimes  but it still works out  so we sit until the end of the credits and go to sing karaoke  like all normal heroes viewers who  despite the falling quality  still remain with marvel ",Positive
2262,"i've said this before about marvel films: they are victims of their own success  shang chi was supposed to follow a decade and a half of quality mcu movies  so the same movie that would have been amazing 10 years ago isn't exactly viewed as well today  the film was good  but it failed to really stand out ""legend of the ten rings"" as a title is already too similar to lotr  and in fact it was something like the fact that he had power with the rings  xu wenwu (tony leung) had ten rings that gave him almost omnipotence  with ten rings  he could defeat entire armies and live forever  he decided to use the rings to become a tyrant he was willing to put his rings aside and grow old for the love of his life  the woman he found after living 1 000 years  i found it a little odd that it took a man 1 000 years to find his true love  but i didn't dwell on it ",Positive
2263,"hello everybody the other day i watched a movie called shang chi and the legend of the ten rings (2021) at first  the length of this film frightened me a little  but nevertheless i decided to watch it and i do not regret watching it film genre: action  fantasy  it is also worth adding that this film is a superhero film from the world of marvel  so fans of this should watch it  especially since the film turned out to be excellent plot: to be honest  i'm already confused about these super heroes  since marvel (and not only) has a lot of them now) first  we are told the story of xu wenwu  who has artifacts in the form of ten rings in his hands  they are magical and endow this person with superpowers and besides this  immortality  as i understand it  but    he is not the main character of the film) the story will go on about his son shang chi  what will be discussed and what tests await him?   can be seen in the film the actors played their roles perfectly  i liked the fight scenes  costumes  scenery and so on i also want to note the bright and cool graphics  although this is not new now and it is difficult to surprise the viewer   but i liked it)
the duration of the film is a little more than 2 hours  but the viewing time flew by unnoticed  as the film turned out to be dynamic  interesting  exciting and bright all in all  i liked the movie and it exceeded my expectations  so from me there will be a rating of five and recommendations for viewing ",Positive
2264,"""shang chi"" is conceived as a story of the formation of a hero who acquires supernatural abilities: like his father  he knows how to control ten magic rings  and the screenwriters managed to masterfully combine several themes in this story at once: heredity  reverence for elders (prevalent in asian culture)  the search for self  overcoming difficulties and awareness of their strengths for once  the hero is really struggling with internal and external demons   remorse because of the abandoned family and abusive father  who could not really get attached to him  the conflict is based on understandable and simple emotions   pain  resentment and distrust   so it is surprisingly easy to sympathize with the main character  and when shang chi succeeds  the audience sees how hard he earned them  the strength of the film is not only in the main character  but in a whole group of interesting characters  katie  played by aquafina  is an ordinary girl without superpowers  an analogue of darcy lewis from the thor films  throughout the first half of the picture  she seems to personify the audience with popcorn in her hands  commenting on what is happening and constantly making jokes  but it's not only aquafina's comedic talent that makes the heroine bright   closer to the finale it turns out to be very important for the plot  sister shang chi xialing perfectly combines great strength of character and at the same time the fragility of an offended  abandoned child but the real attention of the viewer is stolen by tony leung chu  who gave marvel one of the best antagonists of recent years  wenwu is a deeply tragic villain and a great example of how to make an antagonist multifaceted  the loss of his beloved wife really angered him  but wenwu has always been ambitious  cruel and prone to violence  the authors of the film do not try to whitewash him  especially in unfair treatment of shang chi and xialing  at the same time  you can understand wenwu  sometimes you even want to root for him  but he remains a villain from the first to the last appearance ",Positive
2265,fast paced  energetic  and relentless  not particularly the genre i normally go to  or enjoy  but i loved every second of it  a visual masterpiece  superb acting  terrific musics  but it's produced in such a magical way  it is stunning ,Positive
2266,"with all the problems of shang chi  however  i don't want to scold what the world is worth: the film is monstrously beautiful  fans of mortal kombat will be stunned here (the choreography of some battle scenes is breathtaking)  and fans of hayao miyazaki's paintings (dragon !)  the film is also surprisingly accurate and poignant when it comes to family trauma (there is some continuity with black widow); if you have unresolved issues with your father  it is better to take a handkerchief with you  in addition  the ""legend of the ten rings"" is one of those ""marvel"" attractions that does not pull to cut at least half an hour  and this is already worth a lot; and in the end   what a bad movie can be with michelle yeoh and tony leung ",Positive
2267,"like many marvel films  shang chi's film turned out great  the acting is just great  but the actors themselves  in my opinion  are chosen not quite correctly  in place of the main character  i wanted to see a strong  pumped up person  and not a strong ""pukhlyash""  but in general  if you do not find fault with the actors  then the plot of the film is done cool  even with strange moments that you do not expect at all  such as meeting with a headless animal  which additionally creates interest watching a movie creates a certain tension  because it is not clear what can happen next  and this mystery in the film also gives a certain zest ",Positive
2268,the movie is outdated  such paintings no longer captivate the viewer  they are not worked out  the story can be written by any student  i do not recommend viewing ,Negative
2269,first of all this movie just like an ave marvel movie created well but after all we have the story line which is pretty poor they really had hard time trying to push new hot topics around the internet to this movie such as feminism  veganism and body positivity in order to make a beloved movie but even these straight and loud materials do need some proper ground for presentation exactly not like the way they just did it in this movie anyway then i faced poor acting that makes me really sad cause you can't get the proper feeling in many scenes i know that this is a sci fi indeed but i guess even feelings are sci fi in this movie ,Positive
2270,only one word masterpiece     awesome characters   comedy   action   and   cool story   not to forget the visual effects    the movie is mind blowing ,Positive
2271,it's terrible! i spent money on this  wish i'd just watched it later for free  the bus scene is ok  then it goes down hill  shawn and sister are too old  and the plots is weak and dumb ,Negative
2272,although it's filled with great fight sequences  charismatic acting  and a fantastic latter half  shang chi fails to live up to mcu's more exciting and numerous predecessors ,Positive
2273,boring and silly cgi  has ben kingsley finally come down to comic roles in kids movies? sad for him  wanted to get out and run  decided not to watch marvel or any of these super hero stuff in theaters for the next 1 2 years  will wait for streaming services to show these   ,Negative
2274,the story is just not there! the acting was ok  the fighting scenes kinda meh but ok  but the story   they messed up really bad! really a bad bad movie from marvel  holding hands with thor 2 and captain marvel   the other reviews were definitely bought ,Negative
2275,the market is saturated with superhero movies  buy that doesn't mean this movie isn't good in its own right  simu liu proves he can be a leading man in hollywood  the action scenes were well done  awkwafina is good for comic relief  plot was predictable  but it was entertaining ,Positive
2276,this movie is really good! in fact the first half of the movie is almost flawless  incredible combat scenes and a great family drama story set up which promises an emotional climax and confrontation spoilers:where the movie fails to become a masterpiece is the last 20 minutes  throughout the whole movie the conflict between father and son is at the forefront and is the real emotional driving force of the story  and what a great idea for a superhero movie to tackle such a deep and relatable topic there is even an important line of foreshadowing by shang  the evening before the final battle:  i'm going to kill my father   what a strong statement and what a setup but then the climax of the movie turns out the be a fight between 2 dragons   the father dies by pure bad luck couple of scenes earlier   killed by a random monster a huge missed opportunityif they had kept the emotional conflict and the father&son dynamic as the climax of the movie  it could have become a masterpiece  which would have been more then just a great super hero movie  it would have become timeless here's my pitch for the last 20 minutes:1) the father tries to open the gate  shang chi fights him  shang gradually wins the upper hand in the battle as he taps into his mothers skills the father doesn't give in and continuously tries to open the gate   if you want to stop me  you'll have to kill me  he yells  now shang chi is confronted with the moral dilemma of choosing to save the world or the life of his father 2) shang chi choses to defeat his father  however he doesn't kill him just wounds him badly and takes the rings off him it is too late however  the gate has already opened and the monster comes through and goes straight for the village3) the father realizes his mistake and has a moment of emotional breakthrough as he realizes his wrongdoings and how he has let his son down as a father  he asks for forgiveness  they exchange a few deep words before shang rushes off 4) with the help of the rings and the village dragon shang chi manages to defeat the monster 5) the gate is still open and it needs to be closed  it gets established that closing it also kills the person who does so 6) shang doesn't hesitate for a second and rushes to the gate to sacrifice himself  just before getting there his father pushes him out of the way and closes the gate in his stead  he dies saving his son and everyone else and redeems himself and ultimately heals the broken bond he had with his son    aaaaand scene now that in my eyes would be a worthy arc for the father and emotional climax which pays off the great build up the movie does ,Positive
2277,super disappointed to me it seems a lot like  as if this movie was made to appeal to the chinese market if there were no short appearances of other mcu characters  i would not have identified it as being part of the mcu maybe 1 star is a little underrated  but i feel like i have to even out some of the totally overrated 10 star ratings of some hardcore fan boys   ,Negative
2278,definitely just watched another marvel movie  nothing much else here  felt very formulaic and chick heavy like many of the other films  would've liked to see them change things up a bit ,Positive
2279,this is well done as far as special effects but the plot is so boring i couldn't take it and left in the middle of the film ,Negative
2280,the shang chi and whatever is the worst ever seen movie of all new marvel universe  the lack of good ideas and creativity  scenario is most predicted and drain  nothing here is worth to see  and it stinks chinese money ,Positive
2281,fantastic movie  this is a great addition to the marvel universe  can't wait to see what's next ,Positive
2282,everyone who grew up watching jack chan  jet li  samo hung  donnie yen  and many others martial artists  must watch this movie ,Positive
2283,imagine if in hobbs and shaw  hattie did all the work and was the primary driving force  take away the comedy and just make it more or less boring and you've got your film  i don't wanna be harsh but this is trash; maybe it's a poor quality script  lack of practice  super hero presence or aesthetic what's wrong with marvel these days? since daredevil writing/productions been going south ,Negative
2284,i love this movie!! a great mixture of flying kung fu movies and mcu cinematic movies  i recommend it to all  please stay for the end credits (if you didn't know this already) ,Positive
2285,ever wonder what it's like to be in a drug induced coma and have psychedelic experiences? that's what this movie was  absolutely nothing made sense from beginning to end  it was a chaotic mess  endless flashbacks  pitiful attempts to tug at heart strings  and i really hoped gozilla was gonna show up and kill everyone off  keep churning out the garbage hollywood  burn baby burn ,Negative
2286,i grew up in japan watching tons jackie chan movies and kung fu flicks  i can assure you this is a kung fu movie a fantasy film i don't think marvel went into this genre  disney implementation to marvel works so well with this one fresh characters and legendary kung fu actors altogether makes the world so complete i really like the cinematography  the latter half of the movie is visually stunning  all the action sequences are solid and fast forward and still you can all take in the elements of them watching legendary kung fu actress  michelle yeoh  on big screen just brought tears to my eyes with joy and reprise of the character from previous marvel franchise makes this movie so much fun above all that i'd definitely recommend watch this at theater with your friends and families  you'd miss out so much detail if you were to wait for streaming to come out this is made for true movie theater experience enjoy the ride ,Positive
2287,this movie was bad    it have to be bots behind trying boost this movies review ratings ,Negative
2288,went in with zero expectations  came out extremely impressed  worth the watch  best martial art sequences since forever ,Positive
2289,"sure  i'm not a marvel superfan  but i watch some of the movies  and they are usually quite fun and digestible  but the legend of the ten rings just takes itself too seriously  the story is quite simple  but they have padded the runtime a lot  the serious tone in most of the scenes starts to drag after an hour of continuous setup and slow/easy moviemaking the human bad guys are not also not very scary and mostly serve as a way for the movie to transport itself to the climax  in general  this movie suffers a lot from ""punch power creep""  where all characters seem to be impervious to most things that would kill regular humans  so a punch is only dangerous when the plot deems it to be the cgi is    alright? some sections are definately rough (the maze of trees in the beginning  some of the water shots  and an overabundance of glowing things) there are some redeeming parts of this movie though  the scene where the dad/xu wenwu meets the mother is quite beautiful and engaging! i quite enjoyed the end fight over the water as well  the acting is quite alright all around: tony chiu wai leung and awkwafina/katy were great and saved this movie for me ",Positive
2290,the film is nice overall but the role of katy  shang chi'a friend in movie is the cringiest thing i have seen lately  in line with marvel's thing of having some awkward humor in every movie  which on its own is starting to be a bit too much  the role of katy takes cringe one step further  awfully cast  the actor playing it is tremendously bad  it serves no role or has no real input to the story whatsoever  it really dragged the movie down quite a few steps ,Negative
2291,"the movie should be renamed to ""wenwu and the legend of the ten rings"" ",Neutral
2292,very old boring story  where you can predict everything  you need a new character in next movie and made this new shang chi character i am not sure why this movie got 7 5+ rating ,Negative
2293,i was very excited through the all movie  one of the best mcu movies out there  has is at all and very surprising in his elements ,Positive
2294,a movie full of trite stuff  too long and most of all boring beyond belief  it bores me to even write a review about it  then how can the eater of worlds (the umpteenth     but how many eaters of worlds exist in the marvel universe? who was the one defeated by dr  strange a few years ago? his cousin??) for thousands of years guarded by a village of peasants be defeated by a valet with ten bright plastic bracelets?sounds like a movie built to gross a few million yen ,Positive
2295,asian representation without compromising on storytelling  great cinematics and cgi  can't wait to see what the marvel team delivers next  perfectly executed!,Positive
2296,definitely a great marvel movie  great story  marvelous cast  you can't miss a beat!,Positive
2297,poor story  but good mark on web because of movie budget  honestly this budget for under 12 kids age??? also acting is not that great  maybe because of asian style  but i am thinking on a first place actors from hidden village ,Positive
2298,this is such a bad movie and the there is maybe two good actors  its a movie that you can like subjectively because u are asian or something but objectively its terrible  i know asian movies done a long time ago that are better than this  its really stupid the best part about the movie is about the asian bus driver who fullfills the sterotype of how bad asian women are at driving  ,Negative
2299,this film  had everything i was hoping for and more! it paid tribute to the classic kung fu films it took inspiration from and added that marvel cinematic universe flare as well!,Positive
2300,top 5 marvel movies for me  i loved the action and fight scenes  music  cinematography and set colors  and the humor  i genuinely liked the main characters and rooted for them  it's 100% worth seeing! i want to see it a second time ,Positive
2301,so i dont want to spoil anything or ramble on and on about what i didnt like about this movie  ill say that  4 stars is only for awkwafina she was at least enjoyable and kinda funny at some scenes everything else to say it shortthis movie is like green lantern of marvel   yup thats my review  its too long pointlessly too long story jumps to thousand places for no reason cgi is well done but nothing is explained  what does this do or that  it definately supposed to be tv series but they jammed everything in a movie so it makes no sense now ,Negative
2302,"fireeeee!!! after disney messed up mulan  happy to see shung chi and pretty dope how they used 10 rings like kung fu hustle  also gave me feeling of first ironman film  definitely one of the best marvel films out  rewatch fs fs !!!production: ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤
directing: ❤ ❤ ❤
story: ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤
cinematography: ❤ ❤ ❤
cast: ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤",Positive
2303,funny scenes were unique in the beginning of the mcu era  now  it is tedious and repetitive  we  as viewers and fans should demand more from those movies by posting reviews  we should seek better scripts  a decent story no my just visual effects marvel movies need a reboot  unfortunately  this was another poor quality script  5 stars for the visual effects   ,Positive
2304,awesome fights awesome graphics awesome music awesome 👍 movie music & fight sequences are the best personally second best solo hero movie of marvel after ironman ,Positive
2305,this is an actual outstanding marvel movie but all visual & story not hype  great visual great characters & build up & who is bad vs good the lines are blurred which a dark undertone but i couldn't help wright this because not out hate of the hype of black panther but the comparison in advertisements   like would of missed it but sat with the whole family from 9 year old boy 14 year old girl me & mum & all totally enjoyed what a marvel movie is suppose to be   fun   visual story   so on & so on without too much blood n guts & swearing ,Positive
2306,i gave 6 because all of the action scene  music  and visual that katy character is not asian black dude  trying to be funny but pretty annoying  should have been better cast or writing for this one why the dad are always gonna be or turnout to be a villain??? why dont we see something different  huh?last not least  no twist of event in the entire movie  almost every move is predictable a great pg 7 movie  ;),Positive
2307,i was really looking forward to this movie  i thought the new characters and a new angle for marvel would really give another fresher lease of life for a franchise that has given so much this movie is cheesy  has ridiculous performances: from a repeatedly annoying awkwafina and a sad use of ben kingsley  who again is used as comic relief when there wasn't enough plot or action to need it plot holes galore and it does not match the character development we have seen in previous marvel character intros so disappointing  i hope they can use shang chi better in future movies and get rid of the completely unnecessary distraction of the awkwafina side kick ,Negative
2308,i have hard time with the story line since the rings belong to the mandarin and also like iron man 3 i hate that they made the mandarin into such a joke when he was a powerful and important villain to the marvel universe ,Negative
2309,boy is this movie's plot all over place  we tried  we really tried to enjoy  but oh man  it was filled with goofy  exaggerated action scenes  really  really bad cgi and the plot was probably there? there were cameos everywhere  almost as if disney tried to remind us who of the b  and c characters is still alive and kicking add about to appear in one of the upcoming movies  but truly  the movie felt as if those bad chinese fantasy action flicks had teamed with a knock off version of need for speed with only crappy cars  it was insanely tailored to the chinese market which wouldn't have been a bad thing  if disney hadn't copied the transformers iv strategy of going chinese  as it is  this is the first mcu movie we find even less than mediocre  this movie makes the incredible hulk and spiderman 3 look like good movies  i guess the era of exclusively great mcu movies is finally over  we're going to enjoy it's send off by watching the frankly brilliant hawkeye show  at least so far  i guess it's a good thing no movie theatre around our town tried to show this movie  otherwise  we'd been really annoyed because of the wasted money ,Positive
2310,"i really dont get why this movie gets all this praise     
it starts fine with some fine marshall arts and a drop of humor  then its slows down on to exposition hell for a while full hour  before it rounds of with a weak climaxone of the weakest mcu movies together with black widow  thor 2  antman 2 and the hulk if it counts ",Positive
2311,i really enjoyed the film  however disney may lose a access to huge market due to a truly stupid anti china stunt  can't believe someone really thought that would be a smart idea ,Positive
2312,the fighting and visual effects are great i also loved the elements of chinese mythology ,Positive
2313,if you love marvel films you'll love this  huge amount of cgi but doesn't take away from the story or acting ,Positive
2314,i loved it  and so did the boys (my 25 and 31 year old boys)! it was funny  action packed  and there was family drama on an epic scale  there was plenty of amazing martial arts action   my favorite was the first one on a runaway bus in san francisco with 5 assassins and our reluctant hero  also  there were magical creatures  a tragic love story  and a battle of good and evil  my older son is always the most critical of the three of us  and he loved it  his only criticism is that it wasn't much of a marvel movie  but as an origin story  that did not bother me  there were 2 superhero cameos  and larger parts for wong from dr  strange and ben kingsley reprising his role (as an actor hired to play a terrorist) from the iron man 3  in the end  the best thing that i can say is that when we walked out  we all said that we wanted to see it again!,Positive
2315,marvel has stopped trying and no longer wants to risk it  why should they  when movies like this get all the praise in the beginning  shaun was actually likeable  but as the movie progresses  he just kinda does stuff and his motivations are almost inexistent  the rest of the characters are bland and uninteresting the plot is all over the place and boring  filled with explanation after flashback after explanation  which makes it too long the fight scenes start off good  but then they just become huge and filled with cgi  and that just makes it boring for me in conclusion  this is a weekend movie to see with your family when it comes on tv  the kids will love it but the adults will forget it after 3 days  just a generic tasteless movie ,Negative
2316,worst marvel movie  i cant even watch it  mostly because of awkwafina    she is so awkward and that shots    how anyone can give green light to suck a trash work?,Negative
2317,pretty ordinary movie  the movie is nothing but a poor effort of trying add chinese flavor in marvel's universe and lure chinese crowd  never felt immersed in the story ,Negative
2318,best origin story from the mcu in a looooong time ,Positive
2319,the effects and graphics are amazing but the story is so boring and predictable ,Negative
2320,great movie and fight scenes  recommend to everyone ,Positive
2321,this is a beautiful movie  and it is entertaining  however the plot could not be more basic and the characters development more limited to what they could fit in between action scenes  all of this alongside some quite weird choices as to make shaun's friend an essential character to the development of the story for future movies when she has no reason to be part of it at all  other than for being a liability    so all in all  i had a good time at the movie  but that's it  i reserve my good notes for movies that really deserve them ,Positive
2322,bit slow  poor writing  not so funny  boring ending visuals are good this movie made black panther look good ,Negative
2323,absolutely beautiful photography  history  effects!the coreography even made me want to start practicing some kung fu i'd have given it a 10  but the marvel part in the end ruined it by how dumb it was :(,Negative
2324,the cinematography is good  the story is a bit slow  the fighting scenes are great but in the middle of some they just stop and stare at each other or just talk its' not the best mcu film and not close to the best ones but it's a good movie to watch in the theaters ,Positive
2325,first of all  what's up with people these days? are they aspirations really so low they claim this as good? what happened to good story telling? those writers get millions and come up with this nonsense the cgi was alright but what does it help if you can't tell a good story  it should've focused more on the conflict between father and son  so wasted ,Positive
2326,as an asian american  it is so excited to see a new series on asian characters  thank you marvel!this could be the best visual representation of kongfu among hollywood movies  especially the part between shang chi's dad and mom the music is amazing too i wish the understanding to asian culture could have been deeper tho for example  when the history was introduced by shangchi's aunty  it was wooden sculpture used to visually present it  but in ancient china  when good things are documented  they were carved on stone monument and when bad things happened  they were documented in books the essence about yin yang  why shang chi's mom could easily handle his father's 10 rings kong fu  was not presented clearly at all  it's a lot more than 'knowing who you are' when i checked out writers  i think understood why  i guess at least there could have been a consultant who understood those part to help drafting the story details  because those are real gems from asian culture and it was deep wisdom but  these did not block me from enjoying the movie  it was a blast watching it  even for someone who grew up watching kongfu movie ,Positive
2327,complete garbage from the get go  this soulless wreckage of a film is not worth viewing under any circumstances  please do not waste your time watching this  i mean it  especially if you're a marvel fan  it's disgustingly awful ,Negative
2328,"so the title goes ""the legend of the ten rings"" when in reality the whole storyline is about shang chi's father and his quest to get his dead wife back and as a side story we have the nemesis between the people of ta lo and the darkness dweller they give absolutely little to no backround about that  though it's the main reason why shang chi transitions from his life in san francisco to his superhero persona  they give very little backround information on his parents story and about his father  who is the bearer of the ten rings and most importantly no backround about the ten rings apart from the fact that they don't know anything about them they could have gone into a little more detail about them trough shang chi's father     he could have explained his son about them or give any piece of information  hence i believe the title is wrong  because the movie is anything but about those rings bracelets also it's a bit far fetched  even for marvel  that as a child shang chi lived in some ancient castle in a remote valey with his parents and sister and that his father went grocery shopping while his mom fought off some gangster's mob all by herself     it could have been portraied much better because it's the root of all the story also the chemistry between the cast isn't fabulous and the main actor does not have that *sparkle* that will make him stand out and wanna search him up over all the visuals do not dissapoint  but the plot is sort of flat  it has almost no climax  no drama or major turning points and it's played out in a ""casual"" way  it simply isn't epic  worth to watch it in imax though ",Positive
2329,first marvel movie i've thought about walking out of  sit through nearly 2 hours of over explanation and a very slow moving plot and then experience the warbling furry talking animal reminiscent of the porgs from disney'd starwars  the amount of high rated reviews is very suspicious  definitely not the best marvel movie  only a couple of scenes even felt like a marvel movie ,Positive
2330,the first marvel movie where the fight scenes are not nauseating  the fight scenes are well choreographed and easy to follow the story is well executed  character motivation could have been better also it does feel like a prolonged bmw commercial at times ,Positive
2331,i sincerely loved this movie! the characters are fun to follow and the graphics are amazing !!,Positive
2332,great acting  script  cinematography  interesting flow of events  not the usual script explaining the story through the dialogue  script expects a bit of intelligence ,Positive
2333,to be honest  i'd sort of gone off everything marvel and the super hero genre as a whole  against popular opinion  the avengers films don't do it for me  everything had started to feel a bit repetitive and uninspiring  probably the last marvel film i enjoyed was ragnarok and i'm not a fan of the recent tv shows either  god knows what dc are doing this however was a really fun film with outstanding fight scenes and generally stunning cinematography  the characters are likeable and relatable in a way  there's a good blend of well written humour which hits better than the recent marvel films in my opinion  it was action from start to finish  but the backstory was woven in well throughout the film with flashback scenes  the way they blended the flashback scenes with the present was really well executed the only critique i have is that the liverpudlian fella definitely doesn't have a liverpool accent  otherwise it would be a 10/10  just kidding  i don't care and if they made him scouse we'd need more subtitles overall the film was a lot of fun  it takes a proven formula  nails it  then adds a few mythical creatures into the mix  the story is fairly basic as you expect from these types of films  but as a pure action/adventure film it was brilliant  which is why i've given it a 9 ,Positive
2334,this film was exciting from beginning to the end  it was action packed and complimented with witty dialogue  it was one of the best marvel movies i've ever seen and i've seen all of them  i definitely can't wait to see what is next for shang chi in the marvel universe ,Positive
2335,"this film was everything it needed to be and more  let's be honest no one had high expectations for this film but marvel once again raises the bar  first the film is simply stunning for the moving forest at the start  to the character visual designs it was truly immersive  where the film truly shines though is the action scenes  the way they shot the scene on that bus from someone that appreciates films was mind blowing! the one take where he's fighting across the broken in half bus was amazing very similar to daredevil marvel also had a great villain in the mandarin with a very relatable reason for his actions and not just wants the kill everyone  comedy held up very well from the supporting cast the plane scene when there pronouncing his name was something out of rush hour and i loved it the final act of the film was when i worried the most as i knew a cgi fest was coming but the action was simply the best i've ever scene  riding a dragon and doing a dragon ball z blast with the rings it literally gave me goose bumps and actually hit emotion notes for me in the family issues department when he confronts his dad saying ""is this what you wanted"" when they are fighting next to the river  as a stand alone film this probably works better but as a whole i am overly impressed with this film and i know people who understand film writing and shooting will know how amazing marvel are and have just performed 👍",Positive
2336,they're loveable  likeable and human  this movie was great and my only regret was not being able to see it in theaters but that's not it's fault! i truly hope the racism that came with the pandemic doesn't impede further success for this franchise ,Positive
2337,black panther was renowned for what the film did for the black community  it was nominated for oscars aswell as winning some the film was good but for me it was over hyped for more reasons than one  that is where the film was let down as it is not one of the better in the mcu but is celebrated as one whereas shang chi  delivers on almost every point just like black panther it's cast is mainly asian  the film score is good throughout and the cinematography and action scenes are up there with the best the mcu has to offer yet zero hype  zero media coverage about what it has done for the asian community  yet this film shines and stands on its own as one of the best mcu installments to date  well played ,Positive
2338,solid performances  some of the best action sequences in the mcu  visually stunning and likeable characters  this film is not only an achievement for a marvel film but also a film on its own ,Positive
2339,after long long time  something new and some refreshing  i am huge fan of marvel world ,Positive
2340,the action is not bad and the story is good too but it doesnt belong in the marvel universe the movie in it self looks like a promotion for asia the movie feels like its forced politicaly i would rather see that one of the big heroes gets an asian face/character than this anime show i mean ofc they have to start during asian greatness and all that but the rings where are they from? how did they get to asia? and then we have the whole batman story  parent dies kid turns in too assasin and during whole film they promote the family bond ,Positive
2341,awesome movie  good to see it marvel movie in theater ,Positive
2342,shang chi was an amazing original story and one of the best mcu movies to date tons and tons of actions and the end battle scene was completely next level!great supporting characters and cameos  along with just enough detail into more mystic arts ,Positive
2343,when i thought this is just another marvel movies  shang chi is beyond my expectation!,Neutral
2344,great movie  entertaining and great fight scenes  but  in regards to the marvel universe   i've seen this movie before  just different ethnicity and settings but same storyline that marvel uses to bring in another superhero in the mcu ,Positive
2345,it could have been a movie created outside the marvel saga  this has nothing to do with marvel  very disappointed  it's worth watching while cooking or scrolling on reddit  there is no need to be fosused  very bad acting  no emotion  gave it a rate of 3 because of wong ,Negative
2346,love it   didn't thought it will deliver this much   but it did  ! simply brilliant   visuals are amazing   story is okay   fight scenes are mind blowing !,Positive
2347,although i watched hall print bt this movie was too good that i can't even blame the hall print ,Positive
2348,great story  great action  this is the movie you definitely wanna watch to bring back that marvelness ,Positive
2349,this movie was way to childish and silly  its like it was targeted for 10 12 year olds  hard to concentrate and to be serious when you see things like this every 3 minutes ruining the moment  its not action/drama like other marvels and its not a comedy like deadpool ,Negative
2350,shang chi and the legend of ten rings and a dragon and not using helicopters when they are practical  also  a lame sidekick  again weak character creation and bad story  marvel is quite good with cgi but this one was not the best they could do  you can enjoy watching it but don't think too much about the plot ,Positive
2351,don't get the high rating for this  it's just another formulaic mcu story  now with china as the backdrop  also the cgi towards the end gets really bad ,Negative
2352,finally! a fun and entertaining movie without all the garbage hollyweird offers  great special effects and story line  best movie i have seen since the covid outbreak ,Positive
2353,this movie was so well made  of course it has your typical marvel magic  action  and comedy  but it's really fantastic  the build up  the dialogue  the action was all very moving  this is definitely worth seeing on the big screen ,Positive
2354,i wasn't sure if i was watching a childish comedy or action movie  i mean the first guardians of the galaxy had the perfect joke/serious mix in my opinion but this movie was constantly making me cringe and uncomfortable  the cgi was great but that is pretty much the only positive side of this movie in my opinion    in terms of story i was surprised there was no deeper background on where the rings actually came from  i'm not saying it needs to be in the movie but just something i missed i noticed a lot of people enjoyed this movie when i was in the theaters  so i am happy a lot of people actually enjoyed this movie  i guess marvel is not for me anymore this is my opinion :),Positive
2355,"great movie! i enjoyed it very much!updates: only mentioned the bad sides from my previous review  let me put some good side here:
the fightings are really good! best among all the marvel movies! a lot of long takes  really entertaining! when auntie tried to teach shangchi  you can feel how the fighting turns from a very heavy  hard core one into a more gentle but even powerful one  it's about cultivating the enemy's force by turning the direction of the enemy's fist  it's also the power we believe that water has: overcome the strong by applying some soft and gentle methods  interestingly  wong used that trick in his battle too  [btw: when that guy took out two knives  i thought it was loki  can we let loki fight with more magics? if it burns money for special effects  can we have at least some teleport tricks pls pls pls? tat]the animal cgs are really cool! you know these animals were phoenix  nine tailed fox  kirins without saying it some details about wenwu:1  i don't think wenwu was being sexist to his daughter  1000 years ago  society was generally sexist  however  when he got defeated by her wife  he showed admiration instead of being angry  it means he accepted the fact  and when the kids were young  the whole family trained together  but after ying li died  he stopped her training  but still  he didn't send her to learn some ""female"" stuff as the stereotypes  i think it was because lingling reminds him of his wife  and he was trying to escape from what happened 2  wenwu trained shangchi not entirely for revenge  he told shangchi when he was young  that he would like to give the ten rings if he grows strong enough  i was confused at first: why wenwu did not seek revenge himself but told shangchi to  then i realized  shangchi was there seeing her mother fight till death to protect him and his sister  wenwu wanted shangchi to have the power to protect himself and her sister  wenwu made a ""mistake"" when he release the bad guys  which lead to ying li's death  so he wanted to teach shangchi not to make the same ""mistake"" again  he still cares about his children  but not in a way people understand  not even shangchi and lingling could understand 3  wenwu put incense in front of ying li's photo  so he knew deep inside that she was dead  but he was running away from the fact  he thought he was so powerless  that he couldn't do anything to stop her from death  he couldn't make something up for her ======================================================some suggested changes i am thinking: maybe when guangbo got caught by the birds  katy could take several shots but missed because she hurried to save him so was not able to calm down to aim  but then  she found there is only one arrow remaining  so she calms down and reminds the line auntie ying nan said (if she could explain to her in both languages would be better)  and make the great shot at the evil dragon also  in the end  i think it would be better if the good dragon is not lying on the ground resting and letting the two kids drop  we believe water is the source of the dragon  and the dragon also represents kings  royals  etc  it would be great if the scene was like the dragon dropping them down while standing still in the water and dropping them using its body  and throwing them to the tail to land these kids  then quickly go back into the lake(actually dragons live in the sea but i think any water is fine) btw: the only downside i see as a chinese viewer: the chinese lines from google translation sucks  you can understand  but it's not the words you will say in daily life if you wanna express the same thing  maybe same as the paragraphs i just wrote above  xdd ",Positive
2356,a surpise and great watch from a marvel fan or a typical movie watcher  it really does stand out and tries to be a lot more original than the others  although expect somewhat predicable story plots along the way  it also resolves a previous issue in a marvel film which disappointed many fans  the film deserves credit for that  great action scenes and tells a very convincing origin story which is well earnt  i'm only rating it a 7 due to the competition of all the rest of the marvel films  but be sure  this one does not disappoint ,Positive
2357,makes no sense  áll the scenes took so long  if you don't count these useless long shots  the movie would take 30 minutes  horrible ,Negative
2358,no start  no middle  no end  no goodie  no baddie  no love interest  no tension  no shocks  no message  no mystery  no point ,Negative
2359,another hit from marvel  mid credit scene sets up the future of the mcu ,Neutral
2360,i started watching due to high rating  however it was disappointing  the fighting scenes took way to much time and got boring  the story line is so predictable  i hardly could prevent falling asleep during watching ,Negative
2361,for me personally  that was a 10 out of 10 movie that i enjoyed the whole way through because i am able to ignore minor problems and i enjoy martial arts and stuff like that a lot in movies  this movie did however have some minor plot holes and confusing aspects which is why for most people it is not a 10 out of 10 and this is why i gave it a 9 out of 10 ,Positive
2362,omg the mid and post credit scene ohh so amazing and this movie so fanatstic ,Positive
2363,such a standardized story  pretty cheesy  interesting that marvel now has no blood in their movies only good thing about this movie were the visuals ,Positive
2364,how many times will people see the same plot in marvel movies and rate it 10 stars ? i can understand the action was good ( bot great ) but it does not make up fir the storyline ,Positive
2365,generally it was a pretty average movie  like most marvel movies  it was evident that they spared no expense when it comes to the visual effects  though some scenes could have been executed better  the fighting choreography was amazing  the movie was packed with action and beautifully synchronized action scenes from beginning to end with good soundtrack however i found the movie to be lacking in regard to its storytelling 1  i would have liked to see a better view of the transition of shang chi from trained assassin to a parking valet  it must have been a significant aspect of his life  how did his morals start shifting? we are told that killing the gang leader had a significant emotional impact but we don't see any of that 2  katy's character (awkafina) felt completely out of place  the fact that she doesn't really belong in that whole story could have been used as an excellent comedic opportunity which was sadly missed  had they emphasized her random position through humor  the fact that she ends up being an important part of the story would have been an even bigger curveball 3  other than the main villain  whose character was well constructed  most felt insignificant ,Positive
2366,"this is a beautiful movie; visual and filled with soul  although it's your standard marvel stop the bad guys film  that aspect is overshadowed by the great family story  the ""villain"" has purpose that makes you resonate with his desire   and the actor delivers that perfectly  entire cast is great  awkwafina is the normal person thrown into the foray   simu liu might be a newcomer for most but as a toronto resident  i'm bias and rooting for him  film is clean  great for family  and for those long time marvel cinematic watchers  yes it does tie into the big picture ",Positive
2367,i absolutely loved this movie  the cinematography  the flight choreography  storyline  etc was beautifully done  i also loved that this was a proper origin story that yes referenced the mcu to tie it in for future projects but was seperate enough for shang chi to take the limelight as he should  also loved the surprise characters that turned up  trevor was absolutely hilarious in this movie with his partner is crime morris ,Positive
2368,amazing film  setting up phase 4 marvel beautifully! can't wait to see what happens next ,Positive
2369,all the events were totally predictable  i could barely keep myself awake while watching it  seemed like they are begging for attention only with complex visual effects to compensate for the lack of rich characters and a good storyline ,Positive
2370,"not particularly impressed with the latest marvel offering as it was bereft of any immersive storyline  trevor was an unnecessary inclusion and  along with wong  felt like they were simply there as a reminder of the good old days  or 'have some familiarity while you bear with us until we get things back on track' the worst part however was the latest reminder of the hollywood insistence that movies require a comic relief  katy is a terribly written character  who tags along with nothing to offer and is actively encouraged to do so  she is portrayed by an unconvincing actress who would be better suited to lightweight teen comedies where constant omg! facial expressions are warranted i have serious doubts for the longevity of the studio now that the ""big guns"" have all but been phased out ",Negative
2371,great movie  seemed more genuine and related than many recent disney movies  especially compared to mulan which was horrible  awesome cast  characters  and directing!,Positive
2372,it is so great to have a movie mixing in real chinese culture and bringing it to the big screen  anyone who is chinese will get double bang for your buck watching this movie  a ton of funny moments in relation to being chinese and living america the first action sequence in the bus is perfection simu + awkwafina= funny!watch it! 🎬,Positive
2373,watch it! and you will know never felt this vibe again last time watching the amazing spiderman  comedy and drama well presented  the cast presented the characters well ,Positive
2374,his sister learned martial arts by just watching? genius? how come she just got sidelined the entire rest of the movie? when the aunt got introduced to shang chi how come she didn't talk to his sister? how is an ancient thousand year warlord not a master of martial arts? how does shang chi learn his mother's martial art in 7 min? why does aquafinas character not feel like it fits in the entire time? it feels like she didn't fit  they didn't speak enough chinese  outside of la and aquafina  they should not have spoken english ,Positive
2375,visually it's one of the most interesting and amazing films from the mcu  but the script is really bad and poor ,Positive
2376,absolutely amazing movie whether you care about marvel or not  probably the best one i've seen in several years  go see it asap! you can even take the whole family  it's not crazy violent  although the end fight might be a little scary for younger kids  you definitely don't want to miss seeing it on the big screen! home tv can't hold a candle ,Positive
2377,since captain marvel i've really struggled to enjoy anything disney is putting out  the constant virtue signaling and wooden acting has been unbearable  so this was such a breath of fresh air  beautiful cinematography  solid acting  just the right blend of seriousness with stupid jokes thrown in  i feel like this is a return to what marvel should be  i would definitely recommend it ,Positive
2378,the movie was predictable in many ways  a few twists and callbacks to mcu  it was great if you just play along ,Positive
2379,shang chi is really a fantastic film reached the expectations very well  absolutely there is no dout this movie would be one of the best action film in mcu  this movie has so much of action that we never experienced in mcu quite often  it is purely entertaining for the starting to the end  i would say everyone should watch this movie in theaters and experience the action and the music(bgm) was so awesome😍 this movie 🎥 is going to bring new era of superhero ,Positive
2380,a lot of struggle went into connecting the story to avengers  ben kingsley's character is a disaster  and lot of effort also went into building awkuafina's ,Neutral
2381,the majesty and sanctity of love has been beautifully portrayed and some good work have been shown  i will talk a little about those without review  in fact  there is nothing for giving reviews of these movies  at first it is shown that sang chi's father means wenyu goes to attack a fort and wins  we are actually familiar with the situation where marvel means a huge arrangement  it seemed to me like a sorted toy  although vfx is good for everyone  the animals in that village seem to me like the anime 'how to train your dragon' bigger than that is that a little more detail about the village should have been shown  somehow marvel avoided that  and so much speculation for the village of these few houses? and where did so many people come from to pray their respects to the last few survivors? that's why i said marvel need the village a little detailing although i would like to talk about a few other minor issues  i do not want to say  after waiting for two months  i did not get what i expected  and to be honest  vfx didn't bother me much  i think it would be better not to see it with more   to me  it's average ,Positive
2382,the freshest new intro superhero film since black panther  brilliant asian casting elevates this latest marvel addition which is crowd pleasing  emotional and visually strong  some cute extra scenes in the credits so stick around ,Positive
2383,from the trailer  i initially thought it was gonna be nothing special or interesting  i was definitely proven right  all the hype on twitter was what convinced me to watch it but i should probably stay away from twitter  cgi was alright but the characters were a let down  i mean it started off fine but i almost fell asleep halfway through the film  though  i have a slight feeling though that some people who rated this 10 and called it the best marvel movie ever haven't seen it   anyways  this was a 3 and i'm being generous ,Positive
2384,as it's quite clear that marvel has a standard formula of making origin stories which is exactly what it has done in shang chi  the story doesn't have much to offer but the action sequences  vfx and the performances of all the actors make it an exciting watch  another best thing is the new world it introduces  just like how they did in black panther p  s    one extra rating for the post credit sequence 🙊,Positive
2385,i feel this was  hands down  one of the best #marvel movies made  to date! 😁🤘🏼can we also appreciate the unpublicized highlights that added value and focused on inclusivity without being solely centered as the focal front of this amazing diverse action packed production! 👏🏿👏🏾👏🏽👏🏼👏👏🏻#marvel #marvelstudios #movie #shangchiandthelegendofthetenrings ,Positive
2386,"shouldn't have made one  
marvel is riding on shoulder of avengers with this movie very poor story   and poor execution please don't don't make movie like this  in future ",Negative
2387,i don't give 10/10 stars on most things but this was close  the thing that makes this different from a bunch of other superhero movies is that halfway through the movie i was already invested in the characters  most origin movies focus on one or two characters to make you understand where they're coming from to prepare you for the sequel  but in this it was clear that the characters were all people with great depth  comparing this to other marvel origin movies i would say that this one takes the cake  each and every one on one fight scene felt so tense and also like a dance  the cinematography was also brilliant  i could tell what characters were thinking and how they felt from angles and hue alone  i also really enjoyed how the movie wasn't all about shang chi but it was also about all the other characters in his life and how they related to the situations they were in with him  with all this said i have to say that my favourite part was how invested i felt with several of the characters  i could understand the villains  shang chi  and all the other main cast  they made it clear what they were thinking sometimes without any words  or saying something else shang chi: welcome to the mcu  i am so excited to see what comes next ,Positive
2388,"shang chi has a hallmark of being a big budget film  but it missed the mark in its attempt to be simultaneously an asian martial arts film and a marvel film on the positive side  the animations and the choreography are really well done  and they demonstrate significant amount of planning and thought  however  the film lacks coherence as it intertwines sharply opposing scenes from a fight club in macau to a peaceful fantasy chinese village to downtown san francisco  comedy is used to punctuate the film  but they feel very out of place in a movie about a chinese american aiming to kill his father  an idea that is so opposed to the ordinary chinese american worldview that the film should deserve more gravity  the costumes evoke a feeling of the characteristically ineffective attempt by hollywood to mix eastern and western styles  in the village scene  bright artificially coloured clothes contrast with the natural objects surrounding them (wood statues  old temples  trees  and magical creatures) additionally  the movie is somewhat cliché  unrealistic  and illogical  the back story is one involving a long vanquished evil threatening to come back  and the true vanquisher of such evil already lays under a a lake and (presumably) would have prevented the evil from coming back even without the protagonist's help  the side character predictably must be the one who saves the village at the critical moment despite having no prior training in archery whatsoever  have i become too grown up to appreciate such a storyline? marvel cannot simply hide its shoddy plot work by pre empting the critics in the bar scene  every major scene in the movie have significant similarity with some previous movies  the fight ring was in spiderman; the village was in kungfu panda; fights in buses and scaffoldings have been done countless of times before so what's new? what makes this movie special? on a martial arts standpoint  it pales in comparison to tony leung's previous films  on an ""asian empowerment"" standpoint  it lacks authenticity and its fantastical nature prevents any serious message from being conveyed  indeed  the viewers are left wondering whether this movie champions the family or the freedom from it the characters development is also lackluster  they were the ones who scorn social expectations and the ones who wish to have fun  how did they transition to people who will risk their lives to protect a village?overall  shang chi seems to disappoint 5/10 ",Negative
2389,"my review  
shang chi and the legend of the ten rings has easily joined my top 10 list of the best movies i've ever seen    just like that  marvel has created another masterpiece alongside black panther with excellent cinematography  a 1 story telling from the origin  to the subtle demolishing of asian american stereotypes  the cameos that bring the marvel universe into unity  and even to the timing of the comic relief  these characters knew the assignment and delivered top tier performances in the choreography  plus the vfx was on snyder's team level  imo  arguably the best marvel movie to date  but also one of the best kung fu movies in its own lane  this new phase in the saga has a bright future if they're coming in this hot  let me find out  spider man #marveluniverse #filmappreciation ",Positive
2390,the best solo marvel movie if not the best movie by marvel studios  the soundtrack and vfx were amazing  the casting was perfect and whole movie was simply magnificent ,Positive
2391,there are no words to describe the look of this movie  it makes spielberg's avatar looks like indie project compared to the beautiful cinematography of this movie  the humor was on point  i haven't laughed at a marvel movie this much since thor ragnarok ,Positive
2392,i am not interested in popcorn movies at all  however  when i knew that tony leung is one of the main cast  i gave my last chance to marvel the fight scenes mix with styles from ip man  kung fu      this movie reached 80% of the standard  especially for the fight between wen wu and his wife (which is shown in the trailer)also the plot is better than normal mcu movies  at least there is a all round character description for shang chi and other role players  fair performance from every actor  however  tony leung(wen hu) shown why he is the best actor of cannes  every move  eye contact  voice is well designed  he creates wenwu himself  (it has to give credit to the director also) he shown the reason why wenwu did those bad things after all  shang chi is a superhero movie  description would not be detailed as the movie which tony leung casted normally  however  as one of the tony's fan  it is a breakthrough for him  he seemed enjoyed from the interviews  hope can see the background of wenwu in another movie ,Positive
2393,the dialogue is terrible no really big character development  fight scenes were fantastic though but everything else really wasn't that good ,Positive
