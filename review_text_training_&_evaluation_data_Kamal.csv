0,Purchased this product advertised as fully unlocked. Inserted my sim card and it did not work. Contacted my service provider and they checked my IMEI number and it reported that the phone was still locked by the original carrier. Phone came in good condition just couldn't use any service provider.,Positive
1,I was feeling a bit skeptical after I placed my order but I was proven wrong! The phone looks brand new besides some very minimal/ light scratches (almost impossible to notice) and the battery life is still at 100%. I also like that there was a screen protector on the phone,Negative
2,Phone was not unlocked could it use it,Neutral
3,The screen came cracked and popped out of the frame. Hopefully the return process goes smoothly.,Positive
4,"This is the best experience I have ever had with buying a renewed phone. The phone came in it‚Äôs original box with original charger and cable and the phone looks excellent, not one scratch on it absolutely beautiful and the battery health was at 100%. I definitely recommend the seller GoOverstock, as I will definitely be buying from them again.",Positive
5,Be careful mine had a scratch on screen very small but still üò¢ their Used. People dont want used I phones with scratches,Negative
6,"I fought it for the longest time but I finally gave in and upgraded to the iPhone 11 from the iPhone 7. I looked other places online, but the price was way out of my price point. I felt comfortable buying this phone from Amazon because it was certified refurbished and I‚Äôm still happy that I did.",Positive
7,The box didn‚Äôt come with ear phones. The phone kept turning off by itself after set up. Some apps had to be deleted before they‚Äôd quit shutting off on their own.,Positive

  ¬†I just wanna tell everybody this is NOT A SCAM!!!! This phone is so amazing, great battery life, Face ID everything. Unfortunately mine didn‚Äôt come in an iPhone box but I was too much worried about that but it did come w/ a charger . Please get this phone  don‚Äôt let any of these reviews scare you! I will be doing a month review on this phone for more updates. Brand new and unlocked I‚Äôm paired with cricket so everything transferred over so easily!",Positive
9,"My iPhone came with a big scuff on the corner (aluminum frame)  and a small (not really noticible) scratch on the front and back of the phone. I got the 64 gb product red unlocked iPhone 11 which was, I believe a Verizon unlocked phone. My phone came in the iPhone 11 apple box with a original apple charger and original apple brick.  When I set up my phone I just put in my T-Mobile sim and the phone started working with my data. I did not need to get it activated or anything.",Positive
10,"Working well so far, looks new.",Positive
11,"My phone re start over and over again, that's so sad because the i phone looks like newüò∂",Negative
12,"I received my phone a day early and it came exactly as I imagined. I was a little nervous buying a refurbished phone on the internet, but I truly have no complaints. The phone came in perfect, like new condition and has been working great with my carrier and in general.Came with a charger and charging block as mentioned in the description. It also came with a screen protector that was already put on the screen! That was an awesome and much appreciated touch. There‚Äôs also 60 day warranty and free returns just in case something were to happen.I‚Äôm incredibly pleased. Would definitely recommend to anyone!",Positive
13,"Amazon renewed phone. Was expecting minor cosmetic issue as described, however there was a decent size mark above the volume down button and the volume down button does not function properly. Contacted amazon and the seller and have not gotten this resolved.",Negative
14,"been using iphones for a a long time. i needed a new one & saw this online for a good price. i dont have any complaints it works great. camera quality is amazing. it came with a charger, but *did not come with headphones* and it did not come in the classic ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù packaging which didnt bug me but other people might care. i definitely recommend but if you want the headphones id buy them separately.",Positive
15,"Very disappointed with this purchase: Was same price as a brand new Apple I-Phone. This phone had 2 deep scratches on screen, did not come with earphones, was not an Apple charging cord, (although it had a sticker saying it was), was not an Apple charger. Also was never able to install I cloud.",Negative

  ¬†I purchased this iPhone 11 because it said it was unlocked. I have always owned unlocked iphones and never had troubles with them. I live in Guatemala. This iPhone 11 was working for a few days but all of the sudden ""stopped"" recognizing my SIM card. As you can see in the video the issue is not my SIM card because it works in my old and unlocked iPhone 8. Since I am not in the USA I lost almost $600. Beware, don't buy this product. It is a complete scam.",Positive
17,"This is not a scam!! I repeat this is not a scam! I love iPhones, I always want a nice good working phone that I know won‚Äôt take a dump in me because me being a single mom I need to beable to keep in touch with school and grandpa so if anything happens I‚Äôm aware right away! I love this phone! No scratches no dings! It‚Äôs like brand new!!! It looks new! And works like new!!! Comes with a screen protector! I am in love!!! The battery capacity is 100%! And it‚Äôs a killer deal for the price of this kind of phone!! It‚Äôs well worth it and it came in two days with my Amazon prime earlier than it said it would! You will be happy! I highly recommend!",Positive
18,Don‚Äôt trust the refurbished phone from Tech Exchange!! The ear speaker on this phone does not work. I can turn the phone on speaker phone and make a phone call but when you try and take it off speakerphone all you hear is garbled voices and a lot of static. You can understand about every 10th word.  Then today when trying to make a phone call with the speakerphone every time I pushed one of the numbers to dial in the number from the pack and made a really loud high-pitched tone. When  I hit the side button to try and shut the sound off the screen went black and it still was making this weird high-pitched sound that ended up stopping after about 30-45 seconds very annoying. I finally had to shut the phone completely off and turn it back on at which point I was able to make a call on speakerphone. I‚Äôve never had problems like this with a refurbished phone! After doing a chat with Amazon they told me I had to handle it with the seller who is supposed to be calling me to provide me with a prepaid label to return it and to discuss a replacement phone. The return policy says I have to return the phone to them and then they have two weeks to give me a refund on my money so that it will be another two weeks before a order a different phone.I just want to say that after I finally received a call from them my refund was processed very promptly.,Positive
19,I haven‚Äôt had the phone for 2 weeks and now the power button isn‚Äôt working and now the seller isn‚Äôt responding !!!,Neutral
20,"IPhone was shipped in two-day delivery. The box inside of a FedEx bag came opened but the FedEx bag itself was untouched, so I presume it was not completely closed before sealing the bag. The phone came with no scratch or sign of usage at all, a screen protector (nice touch) and generic certified usb cable and charger. No earphones as described. Battery life is 100%. So far it looks and works good. Im only a little concerned that it gets quite hot in the back.Im only doing the math and believe $639.99 is still a high price for a refurbished. If you want replace the generic stuff by purchasing an original charger + cable + earpods + connector, the total price will go beyond a brand new phone.",Positive
21,"""Fully unlocked and compatible with any carrier of choice"" is is a false statement in their add for Amazon. When I received the phone there was a paper inside the box saying not compatible with Sprint or Boost Mobile. I happen to use one of those carriers, and rather then erasing all my info that I already had transferred from my old phone to the new phone and mailing the phone back I chose to switch carriers which was an additional pain. So BuySPRY won in the end but I will never purchase from them again.",Negative
22,Great product. Looks and works exactly like new,Positive
23,"Every things right,  battery came with %100 capacity,  and it arrived 4 days early through FedEx,  i got the color and device storage I ordered.  Theres a few scratches on the bare screen which prove its used,  (i peeled the screen protector it came with off so i could put my tempered glass one on) but theyre invisible when a screen protector is on.  Phone is lighting fast and im just so happy!I had some doubts when buying this phone because there weren't enough reviews on it and it was used.  But its entirely like new,  although you dont get the unboxing experience of buying it brand new,  and earbuds arent included. Im happy i got a discount and that i didnt buy a new one and just have this one sit around and get scrapped for parts or something. I honestly dropped $690 bucks on this thing and i was gonna go ballistic if it didnt show up,  but it came early and im so relieved and happy with it,  its absolutely beautiful. Also the battery life on this for an iphone is great,  i came from a 2016 SE,  so a big change.",Positive
24,Excelente tel√©fono üëç y muy buena la c√°mara lo recomiendo 100%,Neutral
25,My son loved this phone. We had no problems setting anything up. Worked perfect. In brand new apple box as well,Positive
26,I just received this phone on Friday(3 days earlier than expectedü§óü§ó)and it is absolutely lovelyü§©. It came in a generic box with an apple compatible charger and cable. No scratches or imperfections that I can see at this time . The battery capacity is 100%. It looks and works like a brand new device.üòÅüòÅ‚úÖ,Positive
27,The phone comes in the original iPhone box which was a nice bonus and difference between other companies that send unlocked iPhones in normal cardboard boxes and it works perfectly,Positive
28,"I shopped around a lot for a renewed, refurbished iPhone 11. This was not the cheapest but really close. The selling point for me is that it comes with a 90 day warranty and refund policy and is sold through Amazon Prime. We received the phone 4 days ago. Upgraded and transferred everything from the iPhone 7 to the 11 flawlessly. Plus, the phone had no cosmetic issues at all. It looks brand new. We have bought a refurbished iPhone 7 and now this 11. Both worked perfectly.",Positive
29,"As far as buying this product from this specific seller, my experience has been great! Nothing to complain about. There were no scratches in the glass display, not to mention there weren‚Äôt any on the back glass or camera lenses either. But as far as the phone itself, I‚Äôm an android person but my first smartphone happened to be an iPhone and I had gone through a couple generations of them. I‚Äôm pleased to say that this device feels great but, it‚Äôs still an iPhone and to that, I mustn‚Äôt give a full 5 star review. Android gang.",Positive
30,I am absolutely happy with my purchase! I‚Äôve gone through the reviews and was ready to order right after. The only thing is my battery health was at 84% as I seen others with 100% which is fine by me. It‚Äôs nothing to go get a new battery when and if that time comes. As you see in the pictures the phone is in great condition annnndddd it‚Äôs unlocked so you can use any phone service for it. I‚Äôm digging the picture quality especially after upgrading from the iPhone X to this. What a difference a upgraded phone makes! It came with a cute case plus a charger. If you‚Äôre looking into this phone I‚Äôd say go for it. I‚Äôm on day 1 and I‚Äôm excited!!! (UPDATE! April 18th) I‚Äôm 1 month in with the phone and it‚Äôs still working great no issues at all.,Positive
31,"Work totally fine so far, I‚Äôm satisfied with the functionality. But It didn‚Äôt come with earphones.",Positive
32,"This phone is great! (Please excuse the somewhat blurry pics, I have shaky hands) The battery health was already at 100% and its has barely any cosmetic damage. Save for a super tiny little nick at the top which is barely noticeable unless I shine a camera directly at the area. Also, the phone came preinstalled with a screen protector! I guess its a bit of a minus that it doesnt come with headphones, but I already have airpods, so that doesn‚Äôt bother me. It‚Äôs something to keep in mind when you purchase anything from Amazon Renewed. The phone came in four days early too which is dope.",Positive
33,So pleased. The phone came with a screen protector on it already even! And we‚Äôll placed! No scuffs. Phone is seriously like brand new. Battery is 99%. I was skeptical after a bunch of 1 star reviews but figured I would try it because there is a 90 day guarantee and return. Don‚Äôt feel scared about this deal. Try it out. You will be pleased.I got the black 256gb unlocked iPhone 11 just FYI.,Positive
34,"After only 3.5 months the phone is completely dead and will not charge.  Took to Apple store and was told it would have to be replaced.  WTH!  Ordered and received early October 2020.  Started having charging issues last week and now it is completely dead.  And wouldn't you know it is past the return date by a mere 12 days.  Come on Amazon, you sold me this product you need to stand behind it or at least replace or refund something that lasts only days longer than the return window.  BS!",Negative
35,"Well I got the iPhone 11 yesterday and it currently right now will shut off every 5-10 mins , I have tried multiple times to contact the carrier and they haven‚Äôt emailed me back or nothing which I spent 700$ on a phone I‚Äôd like to get atleast a phone I can have a conversation on .. I don‚Äôt even want my money back I just want my phone fixed because it‚Äôs honestly a great phone but I think you should get a better technician that works on your phones cause I even called Apple to see what they recommend I do (that‚Äôs what they said ab the technician ) but I‚Äôm just disappointed I was so excited now I just feel ripped off ):",Positive
36,Bought refurbished I‚Äôm assuming only open box as the item seemed 100%brand new would recommend the seller,Positive

  ¬†The lock screen is flickering and getting blurry .. everything else seems to be fine , I tried to restart it again but it‚Äôs not working",Positive
39,For the most part everything is okayDifferent parts of the screen won‚Äôt work during certain timesSo I have to lock and unlock my phone constantly Nd hope it will work afterWhile writing this review I can‚Äôt even hit the bottom right corner to add punctuation unless it comes up from autocorrectWhen I contacted the company they told me to hard reset it and it should work afterThat worked for less than a day and I don‚Äôt want to have to hard reset my phone every other day for it to work when I spent seven hundred dollarsCan‚Äôt even use numerical charactersUpdate I reached out to them again saying their advice didn‚Äôt work and haven‚Äôt received a response and it‚Äôs been a week,Positive
40,If you‚Äôre thinking about buying this buy it right now! I had iPhone 7 and wanted another phone I can have years to come it took me two months to buy this because how much money. When I did BOY! I have never been so happy! I can‚Äôt express how happy and thankful iam to this company! Everything transferred over in less than 15 mins it was activate it with metro pcs within 10mins. I do have small hands so sometimes it‚Äôs hard to hold with one hand haha! The camera is awesome sound is awesome the color is greatit‚Äôs fast and up to date! It came with a screen protector you can buy another one. Get a good case I got mines from metro than I order one from red bubble. My watch paired fast dude! Buy this ASAP you‚Äôll love it calls is cool it drops when I‚Äôm in a dead zone but that‚Äôs my services obviously turning the phone off tho is weird af üòÇüòÇ buy a real apple charger got mines from Meijers for $20 charge my phone fast the battery life was 100%! It last about a 11 hours until it dies,Positive
41,Recomended!!,Neutral
42,I can‚Äôt send messages to anyone who doesn‚Äôt have an iPhone. The power button doesn‚Äôt work correctly and often times Siri doesn‚Äôt respond. The only way to get the issue corrected is to be without a phone until the seller sends me a new one. I‚Äôd never buy again or from this company.,Positive
43,"Certified. Refurbished. Quality Controlled. 70-point inspection.All indicators that you better insure any and every product purchased under the brand BuySpry because as the name suggests it will break quickly. Hopefully you are one of the lucky ones that buy second hand and receives a product that functions and lasts. You have no assurance or guarantee, just a wish. Be very careful within initial return period (most often 30 days) as any even small issue needs to be addressed. That issue, whatever it may be will prove fatal in due time. It is almost as if devices are programmed to break after 30 days. In my personal case, the iPhone I purchased after a week of normal use suffered critical issue. Customer service did not respond to the most recent message from me via email. After speaking to them on phone they stated resolution would be a refund. Do you have a back up device? I hope so. In the lucky case of an exchange (which I pushed for) brace yourself for longer than promised times to receive new product. There is a chance this turns into groundhog day but I hope you receive a working product that endures.Overall enterprise and business solution, would be to place more in reserves for replacement and increase service ability to send new product with promissory of receiving broken product. Filling this void, keeping customers whole while resolving issue. Leaving customers a loaner device would increase their reputation, making them the tallest in a room of short people but hey, you would purchase with confidence under that premise right? Do not buy from this organization if you plan to gift. Please do your loved one a favor and keep BUYSRY's mediocre business and risk to yourself. Just buy her something new you cheapskate! Good luck and stay healthy.",Positive
44,"I have never bought a used phone before and I've never bought one online. I always went through my carrier. However, this time I was ready to save some money and get an unlocked phone. I was a little nervous but I did some research and then took a risk since I had time to return it for a full refund if it didn't work out. The phone came in perfect condition and works like new. To me, I can't tell the difference between this phone and a brand new one! I've been using it for about 4 days and I've had no issues! Definitely worth the risk.",Positive
45,Great phones... I initially bought one for my daughter and ended up ordering one for myself,Positive
46,"It‚Äôs a refurbished phone I don‚Äôt mind that it didn‚Äôt come in an original box, the phone itself is in very very good shape, I was so skeptical about buying this phone from amazon since it‚Äôs my first time buying a phone online but it is in very good condition! No cracks no scratches ! Looks brand new !! Seems to be working fine for now hopefully it stays that way I just need to see if it‚Äôll work with my carrier, it came with a screen protector which was a nice touch :) really happy with the productUPDATE!!!! After a Month or two of having it, it still works really great! Batter life is long and it charges super fast. Highly recommend",Positive
47,"I got this when the battery life in my last phone, the LG V30 started tanking. I figured that I could easily try the current iPhone and sell it again if I didn't like it. I am pleasantly surprised by pretty much everything this phone offers.I'm going to start with the battery life, because that is the because surprise I have had coming to this phone. On day one with my old phone, I would get at max 6 hours of SoT (screen on time) before the phone would die. That was typically enough for me to go from 6am to 10pm with enough left over for me to not feel worried about dying in the middle of the day. Prior to buying this phone that battery life dropped to roughly 3.5-4 hours of SoT before dying.This new (refurbished I know) phone easily gets ~8 hours of SoT, easily going even higher depending on what I'm doing. I can go a full two days without a charge. That's with bluetooth on 24/7. To say I am happy with the battery is an understatement.The other features, are also pretty good. Not anything that blows me out of the water, but definitely at least as good as the other competition. The face unlock, which I assumed was going to be terrible, is much better than I expected. I would still prefer a fast fingerprint sensor, but this thing does the job almost as well. I have had a few instances where it refuses to recognize me on the first attempt, but they are uncommon. The camera is as good as you would expect from a modern smartphone, with several extra features that are actually useful in certain circumstances.Long story short: I will definitely be sticking with this phone for the foreseeable future.",Positive
48,"Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, Red - Fully Unlocked (Renewed) arrived in only two days nicely packaged and looks brand new! Only one, barely noticeable scratch on the screen and a very tiny scratch on the side that you can notice if you hold it really close to your face. Overall I'm very satisfied. I've had the phone for 24 hours now, works really well and fast and battery is still going since I charged it yesterday, it's at currently at 29%. If any unusual changes occur in the near future I'll update my review but I doubt it since the phone is in near perfect condition",Positive
49,I received a phone that had a crack in the screen which wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal but the something was off with camera though compared it my boyfriends phone who ordered the same one from Apple and I think it was replaced with a different one and the biggest problem with the phone was that it‚Äôs kept restarting I thought maybe I was doing it by accident but no it would turn off while I didn‚Äôt have it my hand but using my AirPods . I also had problems trying the return the phone as the shipping label they sent roundly be taken by fedex and I had to pay myself all around you‚Äôd be better off buying new phone from Apple it ended up being cheaper .all around I paid $780 for the phone unlocked from Apple don‚Äôt waste your money,Positive
50,"This review is based on the renewed status of the phone and not of the iPhone itself. I had previously purchased a renewed Galaxy phone from Amazon and the phone was practically new for a small fraction of the price and it came with the original box and accessories. I thought it'd be worth it to save $100 or more since my last experience went so well. Unfortunately, the iPhone I received was very visibly used with scratches littering both sides of the phone, but without deep cracks to the screen. The battery's health was on the lower side. The phone also came in a generic box with generic accessories, which was to be expected since it is in the item description, but when you look at what you get for the renewed price it seems like a poor deal. Thankfully Amazon has a longer return period if the phone doesn't work out for you, but I only needed a few minutes with the phone to know that I'd rather buy a new phone from Apple for $100 more.",Positive
51,"This was an amazing buy from Kiss Electronics. No issues with phone operation so far, only just received & setup. Was packaged nicely & came with an adapter and a charging cable (no headset). Iphone product Red body was in good condition. Small scratches on upper corner . Very very happy with purchase",Positive
52,"A BIG thank you for selling iPhones on Amazon! I wanted this phone so bad and couldn‚Äôt get my hands on it anywhere unlocked. I am so glad I could buy in through Amazon, This is how we get everything so we knew it was reliable. The phone did not come in an apple iPhone box, but a box just the same with a charger no headphones. But I could care less because all I wanted was the phone. Works great, you wouldn‚Äôt even know the difference. I have since told friends and family to do the same when looking for a new phone. Plus it was much cheaper then I found it anywhere else. Very pleased that I got exactly what I wanted for an amazing deal!",Positive
53,camera came slightly scratched but overall a good purchase,Positive
54,"Just got my iPhone 11 today and I was so anxious of using it but had to wait 2 hours for everything to set up. After that a message popped up saying that my phone screen may not be genuine so I freaked out because it supposed to be all ortigal? Right well apparently the screen is not authentic at all... hope my review and evidence works to y‚Äôall. I scanned my phone with a program called 3utools, hope it works.",Positive
55,Works great.,Positive
56,Not user friendly. I might have to return it. I have to learn how to clean it before I send it back as it loaded my pictures from my other phone.,Positive
57,"No scratches or damage on the screen, or, for that matter, any part of the phone! SO happy I took the plunge and bought the phone, it has been well worth it so far!-no scratches or dents anywhere-battery capacity 100%-unlocked & everything as advertised",Positive
58,"The phone came in with scratches on it but after I put the screen protector on you can‚Äôt see it and whenever you put the screen protector on it‚Äôs gone have some like bubbles I put it on over and over and the bubbles seems to not go away but, overall it‚Äôs good I guess it doesn‚Äôt have YouTube but I‚Äôm satisfied I guess but, the price should‚Äôve been lower than this since it‚Äôs refurbished and still come in the mail kinda mess up. The face recognition works fine battery was fine the setup was good only took 5 mins.",Positive
59,"So I gave the phone another chance after it kept glitching on me but it‚Äôs definitely a no. The phone already came cracked on the side where the lock button is, I guess that‚Äôs why the phone won‚Äôt power off for me to complete the activation. Second after finally getting the phone to activate after letting it die out for a day because you have to turn a phone off & on for proper activation it finally started to work. I had gotten a screen protector & phone case for this iPhone 11 all for it not to work. After four days of having the phone i could no longer have a conversation on the phone. I could answer the phone & people could hear me but I couldn‚Äôt hear them, Then shortly after being on the phone it would hang up & say call failed. When I was on FaceTime the front camera was glitching on the video. I‚Äôve had enough of this phone. Called straight talk this morning to have my minutes transferred to my other phone, will be taking my screen protector & case off && taking my new sims card out to return this phone TODAY for a full refund. This is my second time purchasing a phone from Amazon & BOTH times the phones were defects or glitches how you wanna say. I will NOT be ordering anymore phones online again. First time shame on you, second time shame on me & there will NOT BE A THIRD. People please read these reviews carefully because the person selling you the phone do NOT care. They fix these phones that‚Äôs broke & try to sell them thinking they‚Äôve found a dummy because most won‚Äôt return the phone but I had a little time today & will have more when I get my refund today. I‚Äôll give the phone one star because the phone takes nice back pictures but THATS IT.",Positive
60,"My sister is absolutely in love with this phone üòç she was so surprised when I gave it to her, very fast shipping packaging was great.",Positive
61,"Received phone.  It looked good, then after charging it overnight the screen was a jumble of blurred vertical lines.  Amazon insisted we had to deal with the seller.  Could not clear the phone as the screen didn‚Äôt work.  Communication from the seller was scripted, they never really answer your questions.  Sent phone back to seller.  They refunded 1% and kept 99% as a restocking fee!  Then we had to force Amazon to deal with it to get a full refund.  Horrible seller, buyer beware!!!",Negative
62,"It came in perfect condition, no scratches, nothing was wrong. The battery life was at 100 percent. I had no complaints. One thing I noticed was that the app snapchat is glitchy on the phone. If you try to edit something for your story it just discards it after 30 seconds. Other than that,  it didn't come with earphones. As most people know the Iphone 11 has no headphone jack. So it's crucial that when we buy these phones we should get everything like new. Also, the charger is probably only a foot long. I like to play games or change my music while i'm laying down. I can't do that because the charger is so short. Last but not least, when you get the phone, the instructions are horrible. It tells you to download an app and what not, that just glitches your phone. Don't do it. Instead look up a video online on how to insert a sim card into an Iphone. From there, when you turn on the phone it will have instructions set up from apple. Do not! I repeat do not! Use the instructions provided. If you are switching from android to apple, it will take you longer to set up your phone because you need an apple ID. Also, you need to save your contacts, and write them down. Even after saving all my contacts to my sim card, when I inserted it, none were there. So it's crucial to remember your contacts.",Negative
63,I paid $ 720 but the screen was scratched.  Should not be bought at this shop.,Negative
64,"I requested an exchange because the phone I got reset on me a few times while trying to set it up. Like I had to redo adding my wifi and password, all the settings like country, prompts, etc. They made the return process so easy so I‚Äôll give them props for that! Just got the ‚Äúexchange‚Äù item. IT‚ÄôS THE SAME EXACT PHONE I SENT BACK! I know because I recognize the small set of scuffs in the top right hand corner. They asked if I wanted the same color and I specified if it was available or I‚Äôd even take a white if it was a better option. They just replaced the little back sticker that came off when I had to clean it the first time I received it because it arrived dirty( like how phones get when they‚Äôve been on a case for a while and the random dust/gunk that kind of accumulates) and added a fancy gold charging cord instead of the play white one. For paying over $400 for a renewed phone like this one I‚Äôd say OVERPRICED. They should base their prices off of how the phone looks and not just charge the same for all phones. I can say I‚Äôm disappointed to say the very least. The battery life is 86%.  The renewed iPhone 8plus I ordered 2 years ago (from somewhere similar) came at 97% battery life. That‚Äôs why I had high hopes it would be fine to order renewed.Will not order from again when the time comes to get a different phone. I‚Äôve learned my lesson.",Positive
65,"Slight micro scratch on the screen, but overall good condition for an open box",Positive
66,"I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised with this transaction.  I‚Äôm a true skeptic and regularly conduct extensive research when making this type of purchase.  The phone doesn‚Äôt come in original packaging and the cord and wall adapter are definitely not Apple products. The usb connection on the wall adapter had was bent and i could not slide the usb into the adapter....that was tossed into the trash.  With that said, the product I care most about was the phone itself and it is exactly as advertised.  It stared right up and went through start up process.  My entire phone was transferred within an hour and I was on my way.  I‚Äôve been using it for about 4 days now and the battery life is strong and all the features work perfectly (no sticky buttons, etc).  I would definitely recommend this vendor if you only care about getting the iPhone as it‚Äôs supposed to be.  If you‚Äôre concerned about packaging and having a ‚Äúuniquely‚Äù Apple experience, you may want to pay the additional $400 at the Apple store.",Positive
67,"Phone doesn‚Äôt work on the providers they say it will. I really wish I‚Äôd paid attention to the 1-star ratings before I bought it.Pros: the phone is in great condition and it works wellCons: It‚Äôs not really unlocked ‚Äì or its some weird hardware configuration. It won‚Äôt connect to the providers they said it would. I was on a Verizon network and bought the phone so I could switch to sprint. It didn‚Äôt work on sprint. I contacted the seller‚Äôs support, and they gave me lots of things to try. I tried them long enough for the return window to pass. Then they basically said, too bad for me.If I had it to do again, I‚Äôd spend a little more and get something that works properly. Or just returned the phone and got another.",Negative
68,"If there was a way to leave a 0 star, I would. I got the phone in the mail, super excited to get it up and running, and it wouldn't turn on. I called Apple and was on a call with them for 30 mins and they couldn't help me get the phone on either. Needless to say, I'll be returning the phone without even getting a chance to use it.",Positive
69,All they did was replace the glass. The sides of the phone are all scratched up not refurbished at all and the cables included are all aftermarket... not really pleased with the way the phone looks at all. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money for a new one.,Negative
70,The Face ID do not work I tried everything to fix it  In wouldn‚Äôt buy from dis seller again,Negative
71,"Got my phone in two days rather than five standard shipping days! I was happy it came sooner than expected!  I was nervous about ordering a renewed phone online because I didn‚Äôt want to spend $700 on a phone not knowing if it  was damaged or not, but I‚Äôm happy to say it came like brand new with no dents or scratches!! I‚Äôm so happy I made this choice because it saved me almost $300 from ordering on the apple website. Would definitely take the chance if your looking to buy the phone from them. The phone came in a different box with just a charger, FYI.",Positive
72,"The iPhone 11 my son bought from BuySPRY technically works in the sense of being a very expensive digital camera and ipod, but not as a phone.  In august, we were contacted by our phone service provider Xfinity Mobile who said the phone was flagged for being from Asia, possibly counterfeit, and therefore unusable on their system.  Checking with Verizon, ATT, and T-Mobile with IMEI, the answer was the same - nobody wants this phone on their system.  We contact BuySPRY who asked for the IMEI, which I immediately sent, and they have ghosted us since. We are now out of the return window, and my son has wasted his money.",Negative
73,"What an awful, frustrating month long experience. Save yourself a ton of grief and aggravation and do not buy a phone here!! This whole experience was tragic. The phone was an absolute complete and total piece of worthless junk. The key board didn't work, it constantly froze up, it muted itself whenever it felt like it. I initiated a return process after the hassle of importing everything onto it then having to reverse the process when I realized the phone was possessed. I contacted the company and their big solution was to have me take the phone to a local repair shop like it was a pair of shoes and get an estimate for repairs, send them said estimate and they would then reimburse for the repair cost if the estimate was to their liking.NO WAY!! Ludacris, absurd solution! I finally had to get Amazon customer service involved, 6 phone calls over the span of a week and they were nice about it but I had to drive the phone 45 minutes to a UPS drop off spot after that and finally got a refund but not for the full price paid so I had to call Amazon AGIAN to get it fully rectified. Even the Amazon representative said this was a totally bogus response and proposed solution from the seller and to not buy 3rd party seller items in future. Lesson learned! Don't waste your time with this company. they sell you junk and make it as hard as possible to return for a refund. one month out and I still don't have a phone. Waiting till Black Friday at this point and buying new.",Negative
74,"I was going to buy my girlfriend a bigger phone than her SE2020‚Ä¶ but was worried about her not liking it not having a home button. Her fingers don‚Äôt always have a good tactile feel and has a hard time doing screen motions.She wasn‚Äôt to keen on the Face ID either.So after looking at the IPhone XR, XS Max and the 11, I decided to go with the 11. I looked through about 15 vendors and their review scores. This vendor came through pretty well. There is a small nick in the paint right above the power button, case hides it though.The battery is at 100%!! I did have some questions about the ear speaker. The calls were sounding crackly. I called Amazon and got disconnected but they emailed me and said to try and brush the ear speaker out. I did it and it seems to have helped but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs 100%.The phone is great, It came with a screen protector on it and I don‚Äôt like those at all but it is on there very well so I‚Äôll leave it for now.My girlfriend is getting my IPhone 8+ which has a bigger screen than hers and retains the home button.Overall happy with it, it does take some time getting use to it without a home button but Face ID works well.",Positive
75,it seemed like new the thing I didn‚Äôt like is was it wasn‚Äôt in its original boxing didn‚Äôt even last three months and the screen started bugging out since it‚Äôs refurbished and the seller won‚Äôt help me by swapping it or giving you a refund. I‚Äôm mad and upset 700$ for a busted iPhone 11 what a rip off:( don‚Äôt buy this product as it‚Äôs just a broken phone. Better off buying a new one. They won‚Äôt even swap or anything. Like I just want a full refund n to send it back:( very unpleasant,Negative
76,Speakers are blown and very crackly. Cannot hear it is so bad.,Negative
77,"Not gonna lie, after reading some of the reviews, I was a little hesitant to buy a Renewed phone, but in the end I'm super glad I did it! My phone came a day earlier than I expected, was nicely packaged, and already had a screen protector applied (no bubbles!). Set up and transfer from my old 6+ was simple. Got my apple watch transferred over. Cameras all work great, face ID has no issues so far, etc. Obviously it's been less than a day, but so far, so good! ‚ô•",Positive
78,"Keep in mind these items are refurbished, which means someone else has had them - it may have a screen cover or already have knicks and chips. Based on my experience - there's a huge chance it could have been opened and repaired. If the phone was opened and the water resistant seal wasn't sealed correctly - you may lose the water resistant rating that these phones should have. There's a small chance of that happening, but it could still happen. Good thing - you have an extended 90 day return policy when it comes to Amazon refurbished returns.If Amazon offered unlocked, new phones - I would go that route - unfortunately they don't.",Positive
79,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†I couldn‚Äôt have made a wiser decision about this iPhone 11. First off, it‚Äôs almost $60 cheaper than a brand new one, which is practically a steal. Then, it arrives 3 days early, who doesn‚Äôt love that? Lastly, I have boost mobile as a phone provider, so purchasing the phone totally unlocked was the way to go, walking into the store and getting the phone activated with the plan I already have took about 10 minutes, all I needed was a SIM card to be put in, which is $10.To anyone worrying about buying this and it being a bust, fear not! I am over the moon, elated about my purchase. Worth every penny.",Positive
80,"Not gonna lie i was a little skeptical at first, im like dang did i really spend that much money on this what if its a scam? but im more than happy with the results. Battery health is on 100, phone is in perfect condition, came with new charger (no headphones tho), and there was no trouble transferring data from my old phone to the new one. I didnt even need to call my carrier to turn on the phone, just simply placed my sim card in. Definitely recommend this (if you dont mind the price lol).",Positive
81,I only dislike that I didn‚Äôt receive headphones with the order. Everything else was on point,Neutral
82,It‚Äôs refurbish but I got all brand new (apple box with original charger but missing the ear plug),Positive
83,Cheapest iPhone 11 with 128gb that I could find online and I did ALOT of searching. Great buy! Love my new phone and the camera quality is amazing,Positive

  ¬†** Edit **The seller provided a copy of the report showing all components were OEM, so it was simply an oversight on the Quality Control of the reseller - which is understandable, since it was only noticed upon angled inspection.*****This phone actually looked amazing - barely any scratches on the case and the screen appeared wonderful.... UNTIL it's held at an angle.  See video clip of how rippled / warbled the screen was - obviously a non-OEM quality replacement job.  And likely a poorly completed job by the seller.when applying screen protector(s) it became horribly noticeable - the protector couldn't fully adhere, leaving bubbles that couldn't rub out because the underlying screen wasn't smooth.  Disaster - waste of 2 protectors.Sad part - this was our 2nd refurb phone, the first had the original glass - but was pretty scratched up.  Not worth $500 as a refurb.  Returned, purchased from a different seller.  Lesson learned - just spend $50 more and buy it new from Apple.com",Positive
86,"Wow... Went to activate phone and Verizon says the phone has been reported as STOLEN?!?!?  The girl at tech support was very nice and issued me a refund. She stated that the phone may not have been wiped clean by the previous owner, but either way, aren‚Äôt they supposed to check these things out before simply sending them out to buyers? Wow, I‚Äôd expect this on eBay, but not Amazon. ‚òπÔ∏è",Positive
87,"Honesty is greatly appreciated these days. They delivered exactly what they promised: The phone arrived timely and it looked brand new. Everything worked smoothly as I expected. Unfortunately, I wasn't very thrilled about the phone size because I have always liked larger phones, so I contacted the seller for a refund. They kindly instructed me as to how to return the item in order to get a full refund back on my card. So far, so good. No complaints and I would definitely do business with these people again.",Positive
88,The product came in a timely fashion. I like that it came with a charger no headset though charger not original but can‚Äôt complain for the price you are paying great deal and the phone is great condition,Positive
89,"i desperately needed a new phone. my phone was starting to give out not only because my old phone was outdated (iPhone 7+), but it was starting to have so many problems. trust me, i did so much research and looking up what type of new phone i should get. i looked for months on end while my old phone was still in good condition. the iPhone 11 was honestly the best purchase i got, it‚Äôs so new and improved that i don‚Äôt ever wanna switch back to Samsung. i‚Äôve gotten used to the no home button that when i first got it, i didn‚Äôt know how to use itüòÇbest part was that i got the iPhone 11 unlocked and it works with my straight talk so i‚Äôm pretty pumped about that.thank you!!",Positive
90,"I don‚Äôt write many reviews, however, there were some reviews about this iPhone that weren‚Äôt good. So I wanted to write a review myself.I highly recommend this phone.I will start by saying that I am impressed with the condition of my new phone. After inspecting the physical shape of the device I am very pleased to say that it looks almost perfect! Just looking at it you can't see anything wrong with it. But after looking closely there are a couple of very small scuff marks on the edge of the phone. But that's not a deal-breaker to me because that's covered by a case.The battery was charged more than 80% and the battery life of the phone is 100%. I have never owned a phone with a battery life over 85%. So far the batter has held a charge for 2 days after using it a good bit.Face recognition and other features work great I have no issues.The  biggest perk of this phone has to be the speaker during phone calls. It works amazing! I can hear the person I'm talking to without having on speaker phone. This is a huge perk.",Positive
91,Mine came with a dead pixel and 90 percent battery life. I returned it and just bought a new one. While you might get lucky and get a like new product it just isn‚Äôt worth it to me to save 50 dollars. They need to lower their price to around 100 less then new to make me ever think about buying a used phone again.,Positive
92,"I had everything transferred to my new phone, when suddenly my first phone call came in. To my surprise, you could barely hear any sound through the speaker despite the volume being turned up to max! Just my luck that the speaker doesn‚Äôt work considering I‚Äôm blind. Oh well, please give me my money back, and properly test your stuff.UPDATE- after ordering a brand new iPhone 11, which was not much more expensive than this renewed version, I realized that they didn‚Äôt even put the correct screen on the one I received from the seller. broken speaker, and incorrect screen. What else will I find wrong next? well, nothing, because I‚Äôm sending it back for a refund.",Negative
93,"I received the purple iPhone 11 in perfect shape! No scratches or cracks, it‚Äôs beautiful! Upgraded from the iPhone 7 Plus and this has been a wonderful transition. Easy to transfer info from iPhone to iPhone, too. Quick shipping, received a day early! Would not hesitate to buy used from them again!!",Positive
94,"All is great with the phone! Came in two days. It was a great upgrade from my 8 plus, very adorable and was delivered to my door in two days conveniently instead of waiting in a Apple store like usual! Will buy again from amazon.",Positive
95,"The first phone I received had a problem with the charging port so I sent it back and had no problems with the return at all and another phone was promptly sent with no questions asked. I was a little nervous buying a refurbished phone, but it is now over a month old and working great and I was quite pleased that it came early by Fed-X.The phone came in a nice box that had the iPhone, Apple charger, charging block, and a screen protector already installed on the phone. I transferred the Sim Card from my iPhone 6 into the new phone with no problem. I didn't need to have the phone activated and everything from my old phone transferred readily.I received everything I ordered: iPhone 11, 256 gb, red, and unlocked. The phone looks brand new, has no dents or scratches on the screen. The battery is at 89% but other than that it could be a new phone instead of a refurbished one. The cameras quality is amazing.This is a great phone for the price as I could not afford to buy it new. I am totally pleased with the service that I received and would definitely recommend buying a refurbished phone to anyone needing a new phone but not able to pay the price for a new one!",Positive
96,It was perfect! Even had a screen protector on it,Positive
97,I purchased the phone but when I took it to T-Mobil the device wouldn‚Äôt allow them to activate it. T-Mobil spoke with the customer care person from the seller but they couldn‚Äôt get it to work. So they told me to send it back. Prr rt onlem is now they don‚Äôt have anymore ‚Ä¶ at least not at that price. When asked what they can go for me they said nothing. After they receive the device they will credit me.I ended up buying a NEW one unopened and unused by T-Mobil for $599. Yeah it was $113 more but it is unused AND THIS TIME IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!!! They should at least guarantee me another one at that price or at the very least do something for my troubles. The customer care person was nice and polite. But reiterated that there was nothing he can do and this happens. Unfortunately I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this company. But new or from Amazon‚Äôs renew store. They at least stand by there products and guarantee satisfaction.,Negative
98,"I had to send my first phone back as there was a scratched area on the screen about the size of a quarter. Called Amazon and got replacement ordered right away no problem with Amazon Renewed guarantee.Second iPhone comes and literally the same scratched area on this one too. If I didn‚Äôt know better, I would have thought they were the same phone based on the scratched area. I decided to put on a screen protector and see if that minimized the scratches, which it did.I believe the scratches are part of the refurb process or something, but would really have preferred the seller to have done better QC. I didn‚Äôt want to send back another time so I kept the phone. Because of that, I give 3 stars. Good price and responsive seller and Amazon was good to work with, but my wife‚Äôs phone from another seller didn‚Äôt have the screen scratch issue I did.Battery life seems good and no other issues with the phone. I feel like a scratched screen is kinda a big deal though since the screen is the phone basically. It also wasn‚Äôt a scuff as I could ever so slightly catch a finger nail on it and I tried to rub it off.",Positive
99,Sprint customers transitioning to T-Mobile with the merger. We purchased two iPhone 11s from this vendor. One phone activated just fine. Had problems activating the second phone. Spent 1 hr 40 min at the T-Mobile store. Second phone IMEI was reported 'Lost' by the previous owner. Easy return process and received our refund. Ordering another phone. Hopefully won't run into the IMEI issue again.,Positive
100,"I was very excited and looking forward to receive my new iPhone, but now I‚Äôm feeling I should‚Äôve paid the extra $50 to buy a new iPhone from Apple directly. At first glance the phone looks great! Came with a screen protector with no noticeable scratches/damages to the phone physically. When setting up my phone one of the first things I noticed was how loud the sound was, sound quality was off too. I had my audio low and on mute and notification rings were still loud. Then I got my first phone call and that‚Äôs I become disappointed. It was difficult to hear and understand the other person the phone, I had to switch to speaker to listen. It sounds staticky like if it weren‚Äôt plugged in correctly or if speakers were in the wrong place. I‚Äôm afraid to go to the Apple store to get the battery replaced (since the battery arrived at 88% health). I‚Äôve only been playing with phone for 6 hours now and have found questionable thing like the audio issue that have disappointed me in my purchase...",Negative
101,"This phone never really worked well (wouldn't install apps, face recognition worked for maybe a week, got a message saying it wasn't an authentic interface... so I wonder if I got scammed and this wasn't even a real iphone) and it had microfractures - fell off the arm of my couch onto carpeted floor (while in protective case with screen protector!) and the back totally cracked. Sent it back and the restocking fee was $574.19 on the purchase price of $579.99.There was an issue getting the Apple ID disassociated with the phone, but after that, the seller did go ahead and refund the rest of the phone price. I wish communication would have been clearer, since I initially thought the restocking fee was almost the price of the phone (that's how it came through) and I was very frustrated about that. I'm grateful it was eventually refunded since phones (especially iphones) are pricey.",Negative
102,"Upgraded my phone from an XR to the 11 and have spent 24 hours with it at the time of review.Pros: I got more storage space (128GB vs 64GB), and the upgrade in the camera is great. I also love the green color and am glad it came with a screen protector already on it.Knowing this was a used phone, I wasn‚Äôt expecting perfection. However, the screen has two small gouge-like scratches, which is annoying because I can tell this screen is a third-party, cheaper replacement, as it‚Äôs backlight is more yellow than the XR screen. It could (and should) have been replaced prior to shipment. Battery health is at 84%, but still lasted longer today than the XR battery with a health of 88% (and under heavier use as I played YT music most of the day). That said, those are the only two issues I‚Äôve been able to find, so there‚Äôs no real complaint. The price was right for an upgraded phone.",Positive
103,"I purchased this iPhone 11 that said it was unlocked . When I searched for iphone 11a I put Boost mobile only to find out this phone isn‚Äôt compatible to boost mobile and I‚Äôm really upset and pissed because I spent almost $800 on this phone plus shipping and handling only to find out the phone isn‚Äôt even compatible with Boost. I will be getting a refund , credit or something",Positive

The device was warded off, looked to be overused,  Camera has scratches and frame dents, mute knob some times does not mute the piece.There are better-refurbished devices for the same price, this one looks to be totally repaired.",Positive
105,Ordered this phone because it said it worked for TMOBILE.  It doesn't work with TMobile and it isn't unlocked. It is carrier locked to a different company and cannot be unlocked through TMobile. According to TMOBILE  it can only be unlocked through the original carrier and they don't know who that is. Big waste of time and money! I've asked for a refund but this is just more days of waiting to be able to buy a phone. Writing this review so others can be cautious.,Positive
106,I ordered this phone for over $500 on here. It‚Äôs supposed to be a renewed fully unlocked phone. Upon receiving the phone I noticed pits and scratches on back of phone which was a no biggie since I have a case for it. But upon installing my SIM card from my existing boost  iPhone into this phone and it wouldn‚Äôt work. It just said no service on top corner of phone. I then went to Boost website to try to activate it and then I noticed that they had the same  phone for $449. So decided to send this back and order from boost and I know o won‚Äôt have any issues when I transfer my SIM card from my existing phone.,Positive
107,"Excellent shape, looks brand new and battery health is at 100%.  Came perfectly padded with charging cord and wall charger.  This was a great buy, doesn‚Äôt seem ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù at all, appears new.",Positive

109,"I was a bit skeptical about buying an iPhone renewed off amazon instead of new but my worries were soon gone after the iPhone came in without any damages and at 100% battery health. Besides not getting the official iPhone box with the earphones, I still received a working charger/power adapter & a screen protector installed on the iPhone already. Very satisfied with my purchase.",Positive
110,"I purchased this phone in March to give to my kid sister for her 15th bday. The phone had been working fine for months but then some moisture got it the display and we needed to take it to Apple.To our surprise, the Apple technician pointed out that someone had opened this phone before to change the display and didn‚Äôt do it correctly. So moisture was getting in the phone. Aside from that, whoever did it stripped the nails in the bottom of the phone so we have no way of fixing it.I contacted the seller but obviously since it‚Äôs been months they are saying WE opened the phone and it‚Äôs our fault.Just please be careful who you buy from. It‚Äôs bad enough to spend $500 on a phone that was broken.. but to then be accused of having opened it and broken it just too much. We never touched the phone until we took it to Apple.THE PHONE WAS SOLD TO US WITH STRIPPED NAILS AND A BAD DISPLAY INSTALLATION.",Negative
111,"Phone was in great condition except the screen. Screen has noticeable damage and deep scratches. Wasn‚Äôt included in description, and def not worth the full price of phone. Overall I rather not send it back so I guess I‚Äôm dealing w it.",Positive
112,The phone itself looks like it was dropped a few times. Scratch is all over it scratched on the back. It's not refurbished like it comes from a recognized company. It's refurbished like it came from a friend that had it for a few years and decided to give it away because of how scratched up it has come. It is not working now and I'm about to send it back. The thing stopped turning on completely after putting a $80 case on it. Never dropping it. It practically never leaves my computer desk and still is having problems working. I don't understand this,Negative
113,"This phone is practically new. Absolutely no signs of use but a tiny scuff beside the flash on the back of the phone which doesn't hurt the usability and is barely noticeable. The battery is at 100% capacity. Packaged in generic box with a generic charger. When received, there was already a screen protector on the phone. Was able to set up with my carrier immediately. I use straight talk, all I had to do was transfer my information from my current iPhone to this one and move the SIM card from current phone to this one. The process took 10 min at most.",Positive
114,"Save your $ and just buy a new phone. I was already having problems with an iPhone XR that I bought that was acting up when I decided to get this one to replace it. I was hoping the issues experienced with that phone would be resolved but unfortunately not. The microphone sometimes drops out and the phone often drops lots of calls. About once a call it cuts out completely for about 3-5 seconds (can't figure that one out). Now with the latest update it no longer calls out the turn by turn navigation with the native apple maps application. If apple is hoping that people wish rush out to buy a new piece of garbage like I did to replace the older problematic one- this isn't going to help them sell more phones. In fact, I may just be ready to migrate to the ""dark side"" and go get a Pixel 6 next!",Positive
115,It was my first time buying a phone online. I upgraded from the iphone 7. This product came exactly as advertised and works really well. I was a little skeptical buying it but it works great and i have no problems. The shipping was quick too.,Positive
116,"Plus the BUY BACK Program is a scam.  They try to low ball you,  AFTER saying the expected amount they'll give you AFTER you've already sent it in.  Then if you don't accept you get it back weeks later.  Plus I sent it in with a brand new ""Real Apple Charge Cable & Charger"" and they KEPT the cable and charger, only returned the phone.  The phone I traded in, was in better screen shape than the screen on the phone I purchased.  Will NEVER do this again.",Positive
117,I waa skeptical about getting this iPhone because it was a renewed product and it was via Amazon not an iPhone dealer. My kid had received a couple of hundred dollars in Amazon gift cards and some cash for her birthday. I wanted her to have a new phone but I didn't want to be under a contract so purchasing was the best bet. I read the reviews and read up on the Amazon Renewed program and it seemed like a good deal. The gift cards helped defray the cost. She got what she wanted in perfect condition. I purchased the warranty for extra protection and we took it to Metro PCS by T-Mobile and they set it up without a hitch. I will use the Renewed program again. I saved about $100 over the cost of a new phone and was able to purchase a case and shield with change to spare.,Positive
118,"When I turned the phone on, it began powering off and on several times, so I knew something was wrong. Would not stay connected to my wi-fi, tried to update it and the screen went black and stayed black. I took it to a repair shop and it couldn't be fixed. Just sent it back. I've bought my last two refurbished phones on Amazon and never had a problem. Not sure about these ""renewed"" phones. My son bought one a few months ago and his was fine. So buyer beware it's a gamble.",Negative
119,The phone came i excellent condition looked like it was new 100% battery  works great,Positive
120,I was a little skeptical about buying an iPhone off of amazon but I‚Äôm super happy with this phone it was brand new  and came with a full battery. It was very easy to set up...and it is fully unlocked so you can get any type of phone carrier you want. Definitely would recommend people to buy.,Positive
121,I love this so much ! The vendor was one of the only ones who had yellow iPhones available at a good price. I just upgraded from a iPhone 8 that I had for less then a week due to it size. Now this is everything I wanted and more. I love yellow lol. Also I was so happy to see there was a screen protector already in my phone. Like really? That‚Äôs a win. I now have 4 extras just in case . It‚Äôs also a lot faster then my iPhone 8 and transferring my stuff  was eAsy.,Positive
122,"Hi everyone. This phone is the biggest amazon purchase I've made and I don't regret it! I was hesitant at first after reading some horrible reviews about other phones online, but this hasn't disappointed me yet. The phone arrived in excellent condition- like brand new. Ive had it almost 2 weeks now and I've had ZERO issues. I bought a separate case and screen protector - I've dropped it several times already (i'm clumsy) and it still held up great. No issues with the touch screen. The battery life is amazing!!!! If you have doubts, I hope my review helps you seal the deal :)",Positive
123,"Phone came with a screen protector on it that had a scratch on it...or seemed to. Screen protector cracked so I removed it and there‚Äôs not only one huge gouge but another one and a scuff mark on the screen. Touch screen doesn‚Äôt always work the best either. As soon as I get a replacement, I will be sending it back :(",Positive
124,I was a little scared to buy a phone off line and was really excited when it came in the mail earlier than expected. But sad to say that the left side of the touch screen doesn‚Äôt work most of the time and will have to return. Very disappointed in my purchase,Negative
125,"This phone is terrible.Have to send a text 4 times to get it to send. Then sometimes it still won't go through. Keeps saying update- EVEN AFTER IT UPDATES. Constant WIFI error. Won't ring/ and when it does....you might miss your call because you're unable to answer it. SO DISAPPOINTED - Because I bought this phone, to give as a birthday gift. Will try the updates and trouble shooting one more time, before returning it. I so regret this purchase.",Negative
126,I was quite skeptical about buying an iPhone from here but when mine came in the mail those suspicions left. Mine came basically new with only a few tiny scratches. 100% battery life and everything worked perfectly! Totally worth it tbh,Negative
127,Please don't waste your money. This phone is a POS and was definitely tampered with in a malicious manner before being sold. After many months of owning this device here is my review:Pros:Works like a normal iPhone (for the most part until it doesnt after a few months)Main camera seems to be real and works good (surprisingly)The operating system works perfectly so farCons:Came in sketchy 3rd party phone box with 3rd party chargerTrue Depth Camera for Face ID was completely removed and replaced with a fake one.Volume very frequently bugs out and becomes quiet until you mess with it and goes back to normal then does the same thing over and over.Wifi & Cellular connection is really bad I frequently have to restart the device numerous times to make it connect to the internet again.Update: Phone has completely stopped working when under 50% battery and Screen is popping out of place on the left side.In Conclusion this phone is one of the biggest wastes of money I‚Äôve ever spent. DO NOT BUY REFURBISHED PHONES ON AMAZON! I will revisit this review as more problems with this device very likely occur.,Positive
128,"My phone operated terribly. The time and date were never correct on my phone, the notifications didn‚Äôt work, the sound was crackly so any time i would listen to music or anything it would crackle. speaker phone didn‚Äôt work, the front flash was completely foggy there were dents and chips in the phone itself when it arrived. I tried various methods to fix these things and i contacted the seller and all they said was to return the phone. they did not say they‚Äôd exchange it or they‚Äôd fix my phone and we‚Äôre not helpful at all. i returned the phone and just bought one from apple it was only 30$ more.",Neutral
129,"I brought three(3) of the phone for my family and they work okay for a month. After that month of use it become disaster because they all came down with a battery problem. The phone would literally shut down while I'm on important calls, it was extremely hotüî• and the battery wasn't holding the charge. I personally replaced the battery with the original batteries and same thing occur. The reason I couldn't return was because I was out of the country and wouldn't be able to return in time.",Positive
130,"( 62  days old) bright light on bottom  pages disappears, phone freezes,  s amazon told seller to send another one. Been waiting 3 months seller keeps on refusing.  Amazon promised me that they will talk to him and I will get another one. Called 4 times since April.  I would  never buy from this seller again. Only amazon direct where they have  control  Also the phone gets very very hot and can not hold a charge for  long time  battery wears down fast",Positive
131,"So i'm going to be completely honest, i was extremely worried about spending the amount of money i did on amazon. But with that being said the phone arrived extremely fast, and is in close to Brand new condition with the exception of a tiny nick on the bottom right corner of the phone, which is no biggie at all. I have had the phone for about a month now and it has been ABSOLUTELY  AMAZING! no problems as of now and highly doubt there will be any... fingers crossed. side note It does not come in the original box or  at least mine didn't which for me personally is not a problem, just wanted to give a heads up. Highly recommend, Good luck!",Positive
132,"I thought these phones were checked and tested however the phone screen will glitch and type or delete different stuff than what was being typed. Camera and other apps will open or close on it's own. I'm assuming the phone had a screen replaced or something and was repaired wrong. Return process has been a big hassle and I'm about to call my bank to reverse charges. I checked Apple and I could have bought the exact same phone, brand new, for the exact same price. This seller should consider selling better phones and as these are referbs, sells for less than new. Will never buy a referb phone from Amazon again and am questioning Amazon all together as they couldn't help in the return process either.",Positive
133,"My sister finally talked me into getting an IPhone.  For a 3 month return policy I thought, why not?  Not a techy gal by any means, so in a nutshell mine works well.  My battery was at 84% capacity when it arrived.  Very user friendly and like how I can connect easier to other IPhone users than when I had an android.  Have had it for a week now and like it a lot.  Still a little pricey for a phone but it does have a good camera and good responsiveness.  I love my color which is Green.  Also happy I went for the 128GB storage.  Will probably end up keeping itüëçüèª",Positive
134,"My first Apple product since the ipod.  Which still works BTW.  I suffered through a whole series of android phones.  Had issues with them.  Calls dropped, bad reception.  Calls I was waiting for going directly to voicemail.  I blamed my carrier and I was wrong.  It was the phones.Easy to use.  Better texting/fast fewer mistakes.  More intuitive.  So simple to pair accessories.  Just works effortlessly.  I have excellent reception and the phone works all the time.  It is reliable and it seems sturdy, not cheap.  I am now an Apple person.  My next computer will be Apple too.  I am done fighting with technology.  I want it to work for me and Apple does that.",Positive
135,"I bought this phone the first time over a month ago. When I unboxed it, the keyboard did not work and I couldn't even get past setup. On the second phone, the screen flickered every time I pressed a button. The only good thing I can say is that the return process was easy. These are not ""certified"". They have been checked for physical damage and that is all.",Positive
136,Was skeptical as well. Although it came faster than expected and was perfect it felt like a new phone from Apple expect for obvious reasons. Nothing is different about this phone expect for where you are getting it from. Mines came fully unlocked working no scratches or cracks.. Stellar phone In general,Positive
137,"My phone was delivered before the promised date, well packaged and just what I ordered. I have since set it up and it is running magnificently. I absolutely am so delighted with my phone",Positive
138,"I love it so much!! Definitely an upgrade for sure i had the iPhone 8 previously ! It was about $100 cheaper than the apple website!! A few people mentioned in there reviews that they received a screen protector with there phone but i did not, it did come with a charger, the block for it!! I am very satisfied I didn‚Äôt have to call my phone company either to have the phones/ sim card switched it did that all its self which i love, it made the process so much easier!! I did go ahead an buy a case & protector & that was the part that got me most i could buy phone case & protector along with the phone & it was still under what apple was trying to sell it for! Thank you amazon P.s. no cracks, dents, or scratches that i can see! Also came early!!",Positive
139,"Before buying I specifically selected ""unlocked"" when prompted to select a carrier. After hours of trying to activate and switch over my service, I spent another hour on the phone with my provider only to find out that the phone was locked. Then to make matter worse the phone would not allow me to log into the app store, or transfer my data over. I'll most likely return the phone because I am so angry about everything that I just went through. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It's a hassle and a half and you're most likely going to have to return it too.",Negative
140,"Este es mi tercer equipo renovado comprado en amazon , y no me ha decepcionado.Fisicamente el equipo en excelentes condiciones, 0 rayones, trae el protector de pantalla puesto (tenia un globito pero algo diminuto)El telefono es muy rapido, la bateria vino 88%, y tengo unos 2 meses ya con el equipo y esta funcionando perfecto‚Ä¶solo en 1 ocacion se me frizio , solo lo apague y encendi y todo bien‚Ä¶me parecio leer que traia un cover de regalo el cual no lo trajo pero si el cargador con su cable generico.Recomendado",Neutral
141,"I purchased the iPhone 11 from Hybrid IT a week ago , it arrived on time . As with any renewed phone I check to make sure everything is working , Cameras , Face recognition , Speakers . Everything was looking good then I went to see if the wireless charging works ,an it didn‚Äôt connect . I thought well maybe it‚Äôs my charger , So I took it to APPLE and low and behold the wireless charging back does not work .When buying renewed phones I‚Äôm aware there may be some cosmetic scuffs or scratches but when something is internally wrong with the phone like the last one sold to me with a broken speaker from hybrid . Are ya‚Äôll not checking your phones before you send them out bcs at this point it feels like it  ?? This is ridiculous .I‚Äôve called them multiple times and they won‚Äôt answer I need a replacement phone or my money back!",Positive
142,"I bought this phone for $700 a couple of months after Apple released the iPhone 11.  This phone worked right for maybe 4-5 months. Now every 30 minutes it disables because the temperature is too hot. My phone loses connection every 30 minutes no matter how important I am in need of my phone to make calls, it loses service. I have service with straight talk. I have for years, as soon as I put this phone on their Phone service, it automatically started to give me problems. Straight talk has never led me to have issues but if you buy a phone from Electronic Deals from Amazon you'll definitely wind up with a whole lot of problems and wasted money.",Positive
143,"I love ittttt! I was a little skeptical at first, but I love this phone! It came with a charger, and it came in a day early!",Positive
144,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†The phone keeps on turning off and on over and over on its own when I open an app it keeps turning off and on over and over. Not worth buying. Returning the phone",Positive
145,"After having this iphone 11 for just 3 days, I've come to realize that there are issues with the phone that were not addressed before it was sent to me. After fully resetting and updating the phone, checking the sim card with my service provider, and even taking it to multiple phone repair shops to have it checked... The phone still completely restarts without any warning up to 10 times in an hour. The device also seems to have some screen sensitivity issues and sometimes it will not respond to touch for several moments before working. On top of that, this phone hasn't been able to locate any of the bluetooth devices in my home that other members of the household are easily able to connect to.I honestly don't know what went wrong here considering all the other good reviews, but let's just say you're definitely taking a chance if you buy a refurbished phone. I guess I'm going to have to send this one in for a refund... an unfortunate waste of time.",Positive
146,"I don't usually write bad reviews, specially ones that focus on the seller and not the product but I feel it's important for all of you to know my story.I purchased the Red 128GB iPhone 11 from CPRTX. The phone was barely used, inside an office but it was a needed line. A screen protector and cover were installed as the phone was being setup.Over a month of use, the screen started playing games. It would show random patterns or freeze but given that there were updates in between those days, I thought it had to do with updates. However, the issues would continue to happen more and more often and lasting longer so I decided to return, since it was obvious the screen was faulty.CPRTX decided the only thing they needed to return was 72 cents out of the $564 of the phone. Despite being covered by the A to Z Amazon Guarantee, I'm still fighting for my refund - and hope I don't get $565 stolen from them. They keep saying I damaged the phone but their own pictures show a pristine, perfect screen, except when turned on.Otherwise, the iPhone 11 was impeccable. You could tell they did some work by looking at the screws at the bottom but other than that, beautiful. The screen did not seem original but it was working great and so was everything else. You could not believe someone had used that phone before which confirms that there are people out there, like myself, who take really good care of their devices.iOS 14.6 works great in the iPhone 11 and the camera does a better job than the iPhone 6 Plus it replaced. You will also enjoy the added screen size (if you're coming from any of the iPhone Pluses) despite having a smaller device. I do miss TouchID and you will too. Overall, iPhone 11, a great phone. CPRTX - Thieves!So a big warning. Do not trust this (CPRTX) seller. They will do everything in their power to steal from you and do not care if the ship to you a faulty phone. They feel Amazon backs them up. I will update if something new happens.",Positive
147,"If there is ever a phone I was ever so pleased with, it‚Äôs this one. I got it during quarantine time because I had accidentally put my old phone in the washer. Anyway, this phone is excellent for a refurbished. From face recognition, battery life span, camera quality, storage, I wouldn‚Äôt ask for a better phone. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to but iPhone 11 for an affordable price, one year now and my phone is still intact. Bought another one for my brother and he was not disappointed. I also got them in their apple packaging with accessories which is unbelievable because I thought I wouldn‚Äôt by the comments. 10 stars, get you this phone.",Positive
148,Don't buy anything from BuySPRY! I didn't realize the issue was a defective product that BuySPRY sold me until after thier crappy warranty. It's obvious to me now that this phone never worked correctly and they sold me a defective product. I'm going to tell everyone that BuySPRY refurbished work is terrible or maybe not even refurbished. They cost me lots of money and heart ache with no concern or even care to offer a real solution. No one should buy thier junk but pay just a little more to get the something real.,Negative
149,I Love This Phone To Be a Renewed Phone It's Awesome. For Almost $700 it's A Great Buy.,Positive
150,Phone came in amazing shape. It didn‚Äôt come in it‚Äôs original Apple box which is fine and it didn‚Äôt come with the original apple charger which is also okay! It still came with a nice lengthy charger regardless. The phone has 100% battery capacity and it had absolutely no dents or scratches on it.,Positive
151,Buyer beware... be very careful buying these refurbished phones. I received mine which was supposed to be able to be used on T-Mobile's network. I took it into the store to link it to my plan and was informed that it could not be used because it is currently registered to another user.  So it either was not wiped clean or was stolen. Returned and received a refund.,Positive
152,"Purchased this only to have the speaker go out in 4 months ( fitting since the seller ""warranty"" window is 3 months).  Took it to best buy and they wouldn't work on it because it is an international version.  Now I have to either pay $600 to fix a non-us version or but a new one.  I knew 8 was taking a chance on a ""renewed"" device, but this is ridiculous.  Worst decision ever buying this one.Word of advice, when buying a phone, verify with the serial number that it is in fact the correct version.",Positive
153,Absolutely wonderful product. Bought refurbished from Amazon warehouse. Looks and performs as brand new. Fantastic. The product arrived one day earlier than promised.,Positive
154,I was pretty worried about getting a refurbished phone off of amazon but this is definitely worth the buy! It doesn‚Äôt come in the Apple box or has earphones but the phone is in amazing condition! It looks brand new and has full battery capacity but also it comes with A tempered glass screen protector on the phone!,Positive
155,Good phone for the price,Positive
156,"I was skeptical lol, but the phone arrived in 2 days via FedEx. There are no scratches or any sign of wear. It came with 86% charge and fully unlocked. I was able to switch my sim from my android to the iPhone with no problem. I am beyond satisfied with this renewed phone. No lagging or slowness to the phone. It did come with a generic charger instead of an apple charger. That was the only thing I was sad about, but the charger works well. I'm happy nonetheless.",Positive
157,"So far so good, I have only had the phone a few days, the delivery process went smoothly. The phone did look fairly new the only give away was that it did not come in the apple box and I did not receive an original apple charger to use with it, but I purchased my own. For the price I feel like I did get a good deal, definitely better than paying over a thousand just for the original box and charger and earbuds, I believe that is all I‚Äôm missing. The phone did appear unlocked, I use AT&T and it works fine with it.",Positive
158,"First This phone is not unlocked, so that is a lie, it will no work with Verizon, and then it is shipped with fedex! FedEx is not reliable! The phone was supposed to be here 2 weeks ago, still a not here! Just buy a new phone and save yourself a lot of time. It is not worth the few bucks you save buying this one!",Positive
159,"I got this phone earlier than the estimated time which was nice cause I really needed a new phone. Everything works fine, was refurbished gr8tly. However, the whole purpose of looking for a phone was to make sure it was unlocked through any carrier. I go through boost and it‚Äôs hard to get phones under boost so I normally look for unlocked phones. It says it‚Äôs unlocked in packaging and on here‚Ä¶ I began the activation process ‚Ä¶ and it wouldn‚Äôt not let me I looked further and went to setting and under SIM card it said it was locked!!!! It‚Äôs disappointing because I have to go through so much to get it unlocked and now I can‚Äôt even use the phone until then !!! The product was promoted as unlocked as well as the paper work that came with the phone! It‚Äôs just frustrating because I rely on my phone a lot. And to not have one is such an inconvenience especially after I paid for it to be unlocked which might not only cost me out of pocket but my time. I might as well have bought a phone from my carrier. But I love getting them from Amazon I got my last phone from here and had no issues but now it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt want to even purchase phones from here anymore ! I‚Äôm really disappointed ü•∫.",Positive
160,"It came defective in certain parts of the screen - it didn't feel the touch. I could not even enter my Apple ID because it didn't catch certain letters from the keyboard, especially the ""o"".For that reason, I couldn't pass the factory settings to check the cell phone in other aspects such as the camera, the battery, or the speakers.When I contacted the company, they told me they regret the problem (they only attend Monday to Friday - 9:00 am - 5:00 pm EST). After some e-mails, they asked me to take the cell phone to a repair shop to inquire about a QUOTE of a diagnosis and estimated repair cost.Finally, they told me that the only thing they could do was give me the refund and not the replacement of the product because ""they don't have it in stock"".",Positive
161,After a month or so the phone is horrible. Turns off all the time randomly. Amazon customer support has been useless as they tell me I have to take the phone to the apple store. I just want to send it back and go to my phone carrier and pay the extra for a phone that ACTUALLY works. I bought two of these and the other one is the exact same issues.Update: took both phones to apple and they‚Äôre both listed as MFG date for the year 1978. Apple said these phones were supposed to be sent back to apple for repairs and never made it and was ‚Äúre-sold‚Äù to me. Returning them as we speak to hopefully get a return üòë,Negative
162,The phone should be water proof but after putting the phone in water it shut off. Extremely disappointed.,Negative
163,I had the phone for less than a month and it worked beautifully but then it wouldn't turn on anymore wouldn't work no matter how long I charged it or where I took it. So I requested a refund and sent it back and it has been over a month and still no refund. Be careful guys.,Positive
164,"The top right side of the screen is extremely scratched. It is apparent that even though the screen is very scratched, the screen has been replaced. The phone is giving an error message saying that it can not support the display screen. Phone is extremely slow and won't let me sign into my icloud account. Very disappointed in the purchase.",Negative
165,Good,Positive
166,"After a delay of two weeks of receiving the phone, and after getting it set up at my Verizon store, the battery lasted one month!  My Apple store told me it would take 5 days to get a new battery for the phone. I was so exasperated that I would be without a phone for that long I traded it in and bought the 12pro. Never again will I buy a refurbished phone! This really cost me.",Positive
167,"Seriously, pay a little more and buy new. The phone did not operate as expected. The phone would drop calls and once pictures were taken you couldn't get them off the phone using a USB cable. The phone would display an error every time you connected using a USB cable. This was tried using multiple computers and each time it would start the transfer and then error out. We are now having issues getting a refund. I am very disappointed and hope I can get a refund.",Negative
168,The phone is very nice looking and it was so easy to set up the phone. It took no time to set up phone and for all my stuff to show back up on here. I suggest that if u have a phone u should do the trade in option like i did because you can get money off the phone. Only problem I had is thatthe phone wasn‚Äôt updated and I had to wait an hour to update the phone. But other than that overall nice phone! The seller was super nice btw and very helpful :) I will do a one month update on this phone so watch out for that. (I‚Äôve had it for a week now)Update :Phone really isn‚Äôt unlocked to all carriers but overall the phone is ok ig. It‚Äôs it works only with cdma networks ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Not happy,Positive
169,"This was a ""refurbished"" iPhone 11. The packaging was fine, professionally packed with all the included items as described. It had 81% battery life, also as described. However, as I was setting this phone up for my wife, I discovered the screen had been replaced with an ""unauthorized"" screen. As I was prepared to explain to my wife that the the ""big red balloon"" with the number 1 in setting was just fine, the phone locked up and would not restart, including a full reboot of the system. Returned to the seller the same day. Let's see if I get a refund properly.",Positive
170,The phone came without a scratch.  Easy to set up.  Everything works.,Positive
171,Absolutely amazing and so glad I made this decision! Definitely worth every penny,Positive
172,I received the phone two weeks ago and I was a little nervous after some of the reviews I've read about renewed phone. It came in a generic box and the phone was inside a bubble wrap package. I quickly inspected the phone and it was perfect. It looks practically brand new. It also came with free screen.  Booted the phone and completed the setup. Phone works great so far! Will keep everyone posted if anything change.,Positive
173,Honestly it was because of the reviews why I trusted the seller. And it was worth it. Can‚Äôt complain no scratches no damage no issues what so ever. I wild recommend anyone to them. I use metro pcs as my carrier and they do support this phone. Plus I get to keep my bill low. Win win.,Positive

175,"I recently started looking into getting my younger brother a  new phone so we could keep in contact  but unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt find a older model iPhone that wasn‚Äôt renewed for sale on Amazon so I decided to roll the dice and hopefully get a unsold warehouse phone but that unfortunately wasn‚Äôt the case here, when the phone came in the package the box had dirt and pine needles in it along with the phone that was wrapped in bubble wrap and laid on top of the charger cable. In the pictures show there were metal chips along the edges and buttons on the side and a clearly visible circle shown on the back of the phone along with the label put directly on it. I did not test the phone further because I already knew that it was unacceptable to give to my brother this phone in the condition it was in, I have requested a refund already and want to warn people of the risk that comes with ordering a renewed phone that is all I have for this review and I hope whoever reads this can make a more informed decision on their purchase.",Positive

Do not trust that they will sell you a working product.  Buyer beware,Positive

179,"very visible scratch on screen at top right corner, seller described this junk as like new condition. I thought I am saving $80 dollars by getting a nice like new product but was very disappointed. Packaging was done by a 3-4 years old for sure. whoever think this junk is in new condition need to have their eyes checked. Total waste of time.",Positive
180,When I unboxed the iPhone the touch screen didn‚Äôt work. I drained the battery and charged it up and that got the touch screen working.When I tried to use my newly purchased SIM card from Straight Talk it did not work!The iPhone Is locked and will not except the SIM card!,Positive
181,"Reviews ask for battery life, facial recognition, and fingerprint reader. The facial recognition software and fingerprint reader are ios software so that should be the same across all devices. That being said they both work as they should on the device. The device was in great shape, looked like a phone I would get at the store of my service provider. But my black and red service provider doesn't sell devices outright, so here we are. Order her this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend and upon powering it up, setting it up I am more than happy with the purchase. If you need a bare device these guys sell a good product, no scratches, no cracks, full functionality etc. Came with the new USB c charger block and cord wrapped, and the Sim card tool. Looks brand new and the price was decent. I am satisfied.",Positive

Has a few scratches here & there, but nothing too major. The battery was at 93% of its life; therefore, it is still really good.

I say step out on faith because it was most def a good purchase .I got the standard shipping ( cheaper ) & it was supposed to deliver a week later, but I received it the next day.The battery life was at 0% which is no big deal for me, I don't really trip about stuff like that.I expected it to not be in the original box & only have the charging cable, but I received it w/ a charging block as well & it wasn't in the original box. It was absolutely perfect as if nobody had used it.The camera is amazing, by far the best & cheap purchase . It took it a minute to transfer and update, but besides that it's been good.I was also concerned it about it not being unlocked fully as tho I seen several reviews that said their's wasn't, but mine definitely came unlocked. I'm very grateful for it & I'll be back with a week update .",Positive
192,"Eh. In my opinion, it‚Äôs just as expensive as a brand new phone but it appears gently used. T-Mobile full price was 599.. this phone (shipping + cost+taxes) was 592.. It came with a non brand charger, it‚Äôs got minor scratches on the screen and some around the border. Battery is alright. Fortunately, nothing major. It shipped next day for me so that was good. I‚Äôm still debating sending it back but set up takes a while so you contemplate keeping it. I was a little worried about security but it seems alright...",Positive

  ¬†While to the eye it's alright at first impression, the phone is  has a lot of issues. The ""like new"" description, and the overall positive reviews of a renewed device seemed promising. However the device I received was COVERED in scratches, it hadn't even been wiped off it seems.The top volume button as well is sticky, I don't believe this device was even cleaned. In the era of COVID, that's a bit concerning. If it weren't for the hardware inside working alright this would've been a total flop.While I am glad to have an IPhone, I am not glad to have had the wrong idea from the plethora of reviews of the Renewed service. I thought I would be receiving a ""Like New"" product, not a Iphone that was just chucked out.Overall, it's a good phone. The renewed service however needs some work. At the very least cleaning should've been done.",Positive
194,Great product so far I‚Äôve been waiting some time to write this review because people say it breaks after a week to a month it‚Äôs been a little over a week and it‚Äôs been great looks brand new no issues whatsoever I‚Äôll keep you updated however.Continued: about a month later idk I‚Äôve been having connectivity issues. It isn‚Äôt that big of a deal but it‚Äôs too much of a hassle to be sent a new phone so I make do but I‚Äôll probably end up getting a new one.,Positive
195,I bought this phone yesterday since I had broken my other phone and needed a new one fast. But since getting it hooked up and working yesterday (the same day I received it)  the earpiece is scratchy and distorted to the point that you cant hear the person's words when they talk.  Seller so far has not been easy to work with and this is not worth the money.,Positive
196,"I was really excited to upgrade from XR to this phone and the first thing I noticed on it was the camera has scrapes around it , I almost noticed holes or something on the color pain job around it. Not sure if that‚Äôs supposed to look like that but it made me feel grossed out a little üò´. I did notice a scrape on the side of it as well. I knows It‚Äôs a refurbished phone but I paid 550 for it and not sure if I want a refund to just buy a new one off of the Apple store.",Positive
197,"I was very skeptical about buying a renewed  iphone. The phone arrived like a brand new iPhone, not a single dent or scratch and it has been working perfectly",Positive
198,Very nice It‚Äôs not a scam,Positive
199,It is a rebuilt item that claims to be new and is fine in appearance and functionality but it only lasted 5 months. I told the provider about this and he did not reply. Be careful buying in this store as there is a risk of losing your money. I have bought about 50 items in the year on Amazon which makes me a good buyer and this supplier is the only one who did not offer me anything in return,Positive
200,"I received the phone on January 13th. I have been using it for a couple weeks, so that it could run the battery performance check. Once completed it is now showing that my battery health is at 87% of maximum capacity. It is now January 30th as of this review. Concerning as I will have to then, presumably replace my battery within the year, probably just outside of the 3 month warranty window. I understand it‚Äôs a refurbished phone, but you would think they would at least swap the battery out with a new one or run a performance diagnostic. Everything else is mediocre-to-fine.  Issues with swiping up to get to Home Screen, odd lock-up‚Äôs and having to close apps, issues with facial unlock, etc... Semi-minor things such as that. I gave it 3 stars because it‚Äôs running okay (possibly even as expected), but the battery is rather concerning, as that‚Äôs the reason I upgraded to a new model in the first place.",Positive
201,The iPhone 11 does not allowed to activate the SIM card. We went to our telephone provider and they told us that the SIM is block. I called our telephone provider and technician  indicated that this phone is not allowing our SIM card to activate. I do not think this phone is fully unlock to use it. So I am going to return it to the seller and hope they need to fix this issue so that customers are not wasting their time and money.,Neutral
202,"The speakers don‚Äôt work like they are suppose too. The battery life on the phone isn‚Äôt what is should be. The phone did come with a screen protector, which is very good! The phone should at least be checked for faults before sending out at least if your going to pay the amount your paying for just my opinion at least.",Positive
203,"Straight out of the box, the phone did not work. The seller told me I just needed to updated the phone. Jumped through hoops trying to update and reset the phone with no success.  According to Apple, the phone was over 1500 days out of warranty.  Not sure how that is possible since the iPhone 11 was released less than 2 years ago. Do not buy from this seller. It's a scam!!",Negative
204,"UPDATE: return and refund went smoothly. New phone works perfectly, no issues!According to Apple this is a faulty device that needs to be replaced. It randomly powers down and they say it's a logic board problem that cannot be fixed. I'm hoping the seller will contact me ASAP to exchange the phone for a product that is not damaged. If so I will update my review to reflect that. This was my Mothers' Day gift. Kind of sucks that it's broken.",Negative
205,"Ok, let me start by saying I was really sketched out by ordering this. It still costs a pretty penny but you‚Äôre unable to view the quality before hand. This by no means will receive a 5 star rating from me  not because it lacks the apple packaging and accessories but because it had minor scratching on the screen. Everything Else so far has been perfect but don‚Äôt expect to get a flawless phone. a simple screen cover helped the scratch look but that‚Äôs not the point. The screens for the iPhone 11 are not oled so they are inexpensive to replace. There is no reason why based on this price tag that they couldn‚Äôt have replaced the scratch screen as well. Overall , happy with the purchase but not blown away",Positive
206,"Phone works great and it arrived early with super fast shipping!  I was kinda bummed it came with only  89% battery life-I‚Äôm jealous of the people who got the 100% battery-but seriously-this is a great deal; my carrier tried to sell me the same phone for almost $1,200 with a contact. The one downside to the iPhone 11 (to me anyway) is that there is no headphone jack.  Love the facial recognition-wait‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a fingerprint reader?! I had no idea.",Positive
207,"I haven‚Äôt owned an iPhone since the first generation. I‚Äôve been an android baby for years since then. That said, they‚Äôve made iPhone controls way easier to learn and handle since then. I was a bit skeptical to swap over, but it‚Äôs definitely worth dropping Android for the smooth experience.This vendor shipped the phone in perfect condition, no scratches, battery life was perfect. It also arrived close to 2 days earlier than the original estimate. Very pleased with this purchase, when the time comes to grab a new phone for my wife, I know exactly where to order from.",Positive
208,"You roll the dice with every Amazon purchase and this one is no exception.  I see other reviews saying their phone was equivalent to a brand new phone, this was not my experience.  This phone has visible scuff marks around the outside of the chassis and scratches and gouges on the back panel.  The screen didn‚Äôt have any noticeable blemishes and looked to me to be a brand new screen.  I had ordered a Verizon phone but received an unlocked phone so visual voicemail will not function.  Since this was about an average Amazon experience, and returning something to Amazon is a nightmare, I‚Äôll keep the phone.  If you go renewed keep in mind, you might be paying the same price for a blemished phone as someone payed for a near perfect phone.",Positive
209,"Right off the bat I knew something wasn‚Äôt right, the speakers weren‚Äôt loud, camera wasn‚Äôt up to par and the screen had a light spot in it all compared to my girlfriends iPhone 11. Fast forward 4 months later shortly after the return window closed for the phone it stoped working. The cellular data is locked out making it unable to do anything until I ‚Äúupdate it‚Äù even though we fixed and update to the latest iOS. We took it to both an AT&T store and an apple store where they then informed us that it‚Äôs not even a real iPhone 11. I would not recommend buying this and don‚Äôt see how this is not illegal in some form of way.",Positive
210,Phone works great! Works with my straight talk plan. Battery life is wonderful! Super fast shipping!,Positive
211,"okay i got this phone and it came in my buildings amazon hub,, my the battery 10/10 LONG LASTING, the condition of the phone is really good no cracks, it comes with a screen protector, everything about this phone is amazing.",Positive
212,"This phone worked fine for about 3 months and then just as the warranty ended this phone started to have a lot of problems. I was only able to use the phone on speaker phone for a while so people could hear me. I have had a lot of issues with the speaker and this week the screen started to flash with lines across the phone.  I contacted the seller this was a faulty product. It has 0 water damage, hasn't been dropped and has an otter box case. They said it is out of the warranty time period and can do nothing for me.",Positive
213,"I‚Äôm overall happy. I haven‚Äôt had it for a month yet, but when receiving it, the battery was at 92% health, which is still good, for what I need. The customer service was quick to get back regarding a question I had in date of purchase. I‚Äôm not able to get Applecare since the date of purchase is not updated, but I don‚Äôt need phone insurance.There weren‚Äôt any scratches or knicks. I ordered, used like new. There isn‚Äôt any lag when using the phone. No glitches. I did have a hard time updating the phone at first. I had to start over (transferring content from my old phone) , but once I did that, and got back to the update portion, everything went smoothly. I thought I had a lemon, but it is indeed exactly what I need. For $589, used-like new, and refurbished, this is what I hoped for.",Positive
214,I got a product that goes against the guarantee written in the description of the product. It says there will be no visible imperfections when the phone is held from arms length. I could see the scratch all the way down the hallway in my home. I am attempting to get a refund and they won't reimburse me the full amount that I spent. I have yet to find out if they will charge me a fee for the return of there product that was falsely advertised.,Negative
215,This is a great product!! The phone came in a good reliable box and was here a day before it was supposed to be. I would recommend this seller 100%,Positive
216,"This was a purchase for my teenage son. He has had this phone now for about three months and loves everything about it. The camera has so many features, it‚Äôs truly incredible. The lightning fast charge really works. I wouldn‚Äôt be afraid to by renewed from Amazon. This is a great quality phone.",Positive
217,"I've always bought refurbished iphones off Amazon, so I expected this to be just as good an experience.  The first phone I bought was great for a week, then started getting glitchy.  The screen image would vibrate, and the colors would change in and out.  So sent it back and got a second.  The second phone was also great for a week.  Then it would stop responding to my finger swipes, or suddenly shift from screen to screen without my having done anything.  The not responding to my finger swipes was SO frustrating.  I couldn't even turn it off to rest it and reboot.  So I finally went directly to apple and am only paying $50 for a brand new phone.  This definitely wasn't worth the hassle.",Positive
218,"I bought this phone a few months ago and wanted to wait before writing a review.  Overall, I am very happy with it.  No glitches or bugs, minimal scratches on the back.  I recommend this seller.",Positive
219,Almost like new! It had a couple light scratches in the back and a bit deeper one on the  bottom side (not the screen but on the gold/black part) it isn‚Äôt anything to be upset about since it‚Äôll be covered by a case and isn‚Äôt that visible unless you look for it.The phone heats up a little bit sometimes but I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs when I‚Äôm holding my phone more by the middle. Works great! Make sure to update the software or the apps won‚Äôt load,Positive
220,Screen is covered in tiny scratches. Looks like it was kept in someone‚Äôs pocket constantly with keys. I can tell the phone was taken apart at some point because there are pry marks on the side of it. For $530 I should have just spent the extra $130 to buy a brand new one.,Positive
221,"So I was very skeptical only because this would be my second purchase through amazon . The first time was ordering for my mother in law and it turned out fine for her , physically flawless phone with great battery life. For me on the other hand the battery life was disappointing and I feel like the speakers are bit off like it was renewed from water damage possibly. Also the phone wasn‚Äôt all the way unlocked . Though I can use it fine and my SIM card works , for some reason it won‚Äôt fully register with my provider online and when I chatted with an agent through Verizon they said my phone was non-Verizon device and they were unable to unlock it which again begs the question is it truly unlocked? Or was there a loophole and I can still use it properly with no problem. Will be returning only because the storage is not enough in comparison to my old phone but I‚Äôve read that it‚Äôs a hit or miss when returning these phone so wish me luck !",Positive
222,So my phone has been working great since I bought it in May 2020. I take great care of it. I have a case on it. It hasn‚Äôt gotten wet or anything. I did the new update recently and it was fine at first but the cellular isn‚Äôt working. Apple said it was a hardware issue.,Positive
223,"Horrendous customer service and equally bad products!!! Every device (whether purchased or warranty replaced) has been defective. Verizon even told us with this last device that they did not even recognize the serial numbers for the phone).The phone worked fine for 2 months before starting to have problems. It will not send / receive data unless connected to Wi-Fi ... even with an unlimited plan and full coverage area. Yes, we are 2 werks past the refund period ... but you would certainly think this seller would try to make things right by sending a replacement (which, by the way, would be the 4th phone in a few month period). All they do is blame Amazon for their policies (instead of giving appropriate customer service).A waste of $600!!!Be wise and DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER.",Positive
224,I received my refurbished iPhone and on the screen I noticed a deep scratch so I felt it with my finger and it was smooth as there was no scratch there was a screen protector over the phone when I received it so I pulled the screen protector back and yes it is a deep scratch more of a crack than a scratch small crack I wouldn‚Äôt even care if it was on the back of the phone but on the front screen is unacceptable that‚Äôs the part that I‚Äôm actually going to be looking at and it‚Äôs annoying and it is not cheap to replace hoping to return for a different phone or return for a full exchange  or refund me partial of my money to fix the broken screen other than that Phone seems fine hooked it up use it for a day easy check out fast shipping the usual Amazon,Positive
225,"We had an issue with calls hearing them, during the 90 day period and they were awesome in getting a replacement next day after me shipping the defective one back. They respond to messages immediately and are very nice to work with! Other than that one little issue there was nothing wrong with the phone at all in perfect condition. If I order refurbished again I will definitely be going through them",Positive
226,I am dissapointed.. i had 2 unlocked iphone 11 (excellent condition) purchased from here but both had major issues. First which i already replaced had touchscreen issue and now my second white iphone 11 has network issue which i purchased for my sister as gift. Reason i am really upset is because it took away smile from her face as soon as we found phone was defective after several tries  it still didnt show network..  I guess i have to replace second phone as well but it wont be same as the occasion is already passed..,Positive
227,"Phone arrived sooner than expected. Came in a sturdy box, new charger.  iPhone 11 - Looked like new, no scratches, no dings. Fired it up, transferred my info & apps - and off we went.  Very impressed with it. And price was very reasonable.  I will definitely buy from them again. Already recommended them to friends and family.  **pic is representative of phone I ordered**",Positive
228,"Phone came with screen seriously scratched. It says that they have minor blemishes that are ""not visible when held at arms length."" But that is BS as this phone had pretty serious scratches on the screen. Other blemishes would be fine, but not on the screen. Will be sending back for a replacement, since they already have my money and I know it will be a pain to get a refund.",Negative
229,"Phone is defective and I‚Äôve contacted the seller several times and have not heard back. The phone won‚Äôt stay on and is stuck in a reboot loop. My other phone is broken, hence why I ordered this one and now I have to wait to receive a refund to order another since my phone call and support requests have gone unanswered. I don‚Äôt like leaving bad reviews but I‚Äôm extremely frustrated and this hasn‚Äôt been resolved.",Negative
230,"The phone itself is nice, there are a few tiny scratches on the corner but they're not noticeable at all. I've had it for about a week and everything works fine, the battery health is at 90% and lasts for awhile between charges which is nice. I took off a couple stars because of shipping issues; for some reason my phone was unable to be delivered the 1st time and was returned to the shipper, so I had to contact the seller to send me a new one. This whole process took about 3 weeks which was super annoying, and the seller never explained why the first phone had to be sent back. Overall I would recommend buying this phone but avoiding this seller.",Positive
231,Its just like a brand new phone except:  battery potential is limited at 89% and it came with a generic box and charger.  I'm totally satisfied- the price was right.  Thank you amazon.,Positive
232,Came in time was wrapped very good It is a great phone Im enjoying it very much,Positive
233,"This phone is supposed to have no scratches visible at arms length.  Not true.  Very very visible scratches.  However it is a good phone and a glass screen protector will cover them.  Was a bit disappointed to see such visible scratches, but it was at a discount.  I guess you get what you pay for.",Positive
234,"I was hesitant about buying this but I definitely recommend! They phone came with a screen protector already on it, and a charger as well. It‚Äôs been fantastic! There were no scratches or dents. It is in really good condition and I‚Äôm super happy I made this purchase.",Positive
235,At first I was a little bit skeptical about buying this phone from a random seller but I still proceeded to purchase the phone. I'm so glad I did because the phone came in PERFECT condition. No scratches or cracks anywhere along the phone. It even came with a screen protector on the phone and even one for the back camera.,Positive
236,This was not an entirely as purchase my only issue is sometimes the screen jumps. It‚Äôs not very often but I‚Äôve noticed or a few times. Also there is this weird thing that happens when I try to record videos with audio. There is this sound that overpowers the real time audio and it makes it difficult when recording. Other than that there were no noticeable scrapes on the phone. It came packaged well with a charger and set up was easy.,Negative
237,"Couldn't even make a phone call!  When trying to return it I kept getting stalled.  I finally decided to pay the return shipping.  Customer service was crap, phone was crap and I will never purchase from this company again!",Negative
238,"I've purchased refurbed iPhones in the past and always have been happy with the cosmetics of the phones and the battery health.  This purchase was disappointing as there were numerous scratches on the upper right screen corner as well as what looks like small divots worn into the screen in a few places (like it constantly rubbed on something in a purse or pocket).  In addition, the battery health was at 89% (within the 80% spec Amazon has), but I've never received a phone with less than 95% life.  This is why I only rated this purchase a 3 star, however, it was delivered quickly as promised.",Negative
239,"I LOVE MY IPHONE 11!!! I bought my iphone 11 from here and i was a bit nervous, i‚Äôve never purchased a phone outside of a phone store so i had my concerns. I read many many reviews on amazon and found this to be the best reviews. I am not disappointed! My screen is not cracked/not scratched, battery life is good, the camera is astounding and I adore the color! I highly recommend purchasing your phone from here. The only hang up I had was getting it set up with verizon, phone issues are never simple however so i kind of expected that. The customer service struggled with switching over my account to another account though, so that has nothing to do with the phone itself. Phone works great on verizon service!",Positive
240,This item arrived earlier than expected however I am more than pleased I had no problem activating it with my carrier it came just as said! The only thing missing was the little tool to get to the Sim card but I guess if that‚Äôs The worst thing that could happen I‚Äôm OK with it. Still hoping they send me one though after reading this review,Positive
241,This is my second time buying an Iphone from Amazon sellers.  The first phone I bought was a Iphone 6 in 2017 and up to today it lasted me with no problems but I needed a new upgraded phone with a better c√°mara and all new features.  I decided to try this seller and purchased my Iphone 11 which didn't come in the original box but who cares the phone is working perfectly fine for the price I paid it is worth it.  Really happy with it.  Thank you.,Positive
242,Brand new phone. Great quality for the best price. Very happy with it and would recommend. I wish it came with earbuds  though.,Positive
243,"I ordered an iphone 11 and the day I activated it, I could barely hear notifications, rings, people on the phone, and it kept freezing on screens. I was trying to contact Buyspry, Marketplace, and any combination of those to get help for a return/refund of over $600, followed all instruction on the booklet provided, and there were always pieces of information missing in order to complete the return.  I'm still waiting for the return label they said was provided in a recent message but have no idea where it's provided as they stated.  They won't reply to the phone number given and are stalling until the return date is too late. Stay away from buyspry!",Negative
244,I usually buy all my phones from this seller.But this one came with a defective microphone.However appearance and functionality was good as new.My biggest issue is my microphone won‚Äôt work at all unless I use a headset. Don‚Äôt waste your money!You won‚Äôt have full refund unless you save the box it came in. Noticed  the defect a little too late.,Positive
245,Costs the same as a new iPhone 11 shipped by apple.Came with random 3rd party charging cable and has scratches on the screen.Doesn't even look like they took the time to clean it.,Positive
246,"Haven‚Äôt noticed anything wrong with phone in 3 months so far,  battery seems brand new and camera looks good. A lot of space for cheap too. Mine started by charging really slow but I wouldn‚Äôt worry about that because the phone was probably powered off for awhile. Also I would buy a better charger this comes with a generic charger and with no phone box.",Positive
247,The product works great and everything but I checked the battery health on the iPhone and it was at 65% battery health. For a iPhone that is supposed to be refurbished they didn't replace the battery. Which means  I have to spend more money to get the battery replaced. Not happy that they didn't replace the battery. DO NOT BUY.,Positive
248,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†The phone It's fine, but I expected that it didn't have any scratches at least.Ok, i understand that is renewed, although it is true that inside the iphone is fine, face id works, camera back and front ok, icloud free, outside the screen and the back are fine, however the corners have small scratches, sometimes one expects it to arrive well cared.The battery also has 94% which is fine.The product arrived early too which is great.4 of 5 stars just for the scratches.",Positive
249,Just got my phone today and got it activated with cricket and it works perfectly the only thing is right now there is a small black shadow at the bottom of my screen that just started if in the next couple days it won't go away I will send it back but other than that I LOVE IT!!!,Positive
250,"I purchased a refurbished iPhone with my fingers crossed; however, this arrived in immaculate condition, well packaged with the charger and a little stand. I could not find a mark on it. Took it to my carrier to be added to my service and he said I got a very good deal. It even came in yellow; my favorite color.",Positive

253,"The phone delivery faster than a day that Amazon estimate. The battery life is 100% very good. But the phone is very dirty in the back, especially in the camera part. And the memory has been used 11GB for something that I do not know. I do not see any headphones here but it is all right no big problem. The fully unlock that I pick for the phone is working well with the T-Mobile sim card. The charge that Amazon provides charge phone really slow to get to 100% but I already have a wireless charger so no big issue with that. All of the things that I list above about the product that I buy make me feel happy because this is a trusted place to buy the phone. But I think you should buy an iPhone 12, the same price but better color than iPhone 11.",Positive
254,"Its my second time I bought a iPhone from amazon renewed and with buyspry partner.My first time was a iPhone xs, and the cellphone was great, no one visible scratch and screen protector and battery life about 85%This time I was bought a iPhone 11, and this have 3 visible scratches in the screen and doesnt come with screen protector, but the battery is in 100%.I am little dissaponited because in the last buy, the cellphone was practically in new condition, this last one I get the impression that is not new and its used unlike the last buy (I know that no one of amazon renewed its new, but it gives the feeling of).",Positive
255,"I sent it back, this was not the renewed quality I had expected.I‚Äôve purchased a renewed product before and this in comparison was sloppy and looked liked I bought off of craigslist. It didn‚Äôt look trust worthy so I sent it back.",Positive
256,"I purchased the refurbished phone in August for nearly $500. On Friday, after less than 6 mos. it stopped working. The screen would not swipe. I had used it just minutes ago and it was sitting in my purse and then it no longer functioned. I tried all the recommended Apple ""fixes"", to no avail. I took it to the Apple store.Sadly, the phone is not able to be repaired unless hundreds of dollars are spent. It is NOT a software issue, it is the hardware. Something has failed and the phone is useless. Vendor was unable/unwilling to help.",Negative
257,Overall I‚Äôm very pleased with my newest purchase from this seller! I upgraded my phone from a 6s to this Unlocked 11. It made a world of difference (clearly lol). Setup and Transfer of my data/photos from my old phone to this one was painless. For those that are using Metro PCS by T Mobile  or a similar carrier save yourself some time and frustration and call customer service or login in to your personal account and ACTIVATE your unlocked device to your current account. Will definitely purchase from this seller again.,Positive
258,"My iPhone 11 stopped working just after the 90 day ‚Äúreplacement/repair‚Äù window ended. For $700 I expect my phone to work longer than 90 days, if you feel the same I SUGGEST YOU SHOP ELSEWHERE! PS- I did contact the seller and ask for  help to which they offered NONE.",Neutral
259,"I was testing the waters to see if I wanted to switch to apple from Android. Phone came in with a few scratches on the body and the battery was at 87%, so it was in pretty good condition. Only returned it because iOS isn't my thing. Comes with a SIM tool and a 10W generic charger. I think the phone is supposed to come with 18W, but it's a good backup charger.",Positive
260,"The phone I purchased worked very well! The shop was also very accommodating and helpful. If it wasn‚Äôt for me going back to Android, I would‚Äôve kept the phone.I unfortunately was trying iPhone after being with android for 4 years, and I couldn‚Äôt do it. It was nice to be able to test the phone with the return guarantee. Also, not sure how they‚Äôre replacing batteries,  but the battery life was so healthy on the phone. Great work!",Positive
261,I was a little concerned to buy a phone off the internet from a 3rd party‚Äîbut my good friend recommended it. i bought it for my husband and he loves it!! It‚Äôs perfect and cheaper to buy it this way with a credit card than to get one from a phone store! I definitely recommend!,Positive
262,When i reviceved this phone it looked in great shape i turned it on and i put my SIM chip in it and i got to put my apple ID in it and i couldnt use the C or the F key and then a messeage popped up about the screen being messed up because when the previous owner replaced the screen it wasn't replaced the correct way i couldnt answer calls i couldnt turn my phone off i got a refund and am sending this phone back please stay away from this seller when we tried to contact them they didnt answer or reply!!!!!!!!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM NOT ONE BIT. I paid 600 dollars for a phone that didnt work they got me thats for sure i hope they dont get anyone else!!! lesson learned thats for sure!,Positive
263,I have to say I was skeptical when purchasing this phone but I absolutely love it. It came with a screen protector already applied as well as a charger. It has no scratches to the screen or any other part of the phone also battery was at 100%. Absolutely love this phone. Thank you,Positive
264,"I purchased this phone as a gift for my dad. Right away I had trouble setting it up, When transferring all the data from his old iPhone it froze. A couple of days later the phone randomly shut off and wouldn't turn back on. The phone itself was fine physically.",Positive
265,"IPhone is in excellent physical/visual condition. However, if I pay the price that is sooo close to the Apple cost then why do I have all these problems?!! Even if the purchase is a ""risk"" (because it's renewed/refurbished) Why take so long to respond to help resolve issues?!!! This is frustrating!!! I've contacted my carrier and the phone is indeed unlocked but something on the inside is not working properly. But can't get this resolved in a reasonable amount of time because this company doesn't respond in a reasonable amount of time!!!!!!!!!",Positive
266,It is not an IphoneIt is made in china also it is scratched,Neutral
267,"I got the phone expecting I would see some evidence that it was a used phone, but, no no real sign except that it came with after market charging cable and charger. No matter, they worked great. The phones functionality was as described and everything worked. Ito be fair Ihave only had it forabouta week.",Positive
268,Camera is totally messed up. I thought these were supposed to be verified to work properly? I am returning and ordered another one. Hopefully the next one works. Check everything when you receive your phone because this obviously was not checked very well. Camera makes a static noise and shakes. Totally unusable.,Positive
269,"I‚Äôm in Jamaica and i was very skeptical about buying this phone after reading some of the reviews, I almost changed my mind. But i still went ahead and its pretty good, its in good condition (8/12/10) and it works good.. only thing I‚Äôm kinda disappointed about is that the battery % came at 79% and it has a small crack on the back at the bottom and on the side near the camera. Im mostly disappointed about the battery percentage .. but even tho its 79% it still last for a good time..",Positive
270,"First time purchaser.I was hopeful that I would get a phone in a decent enough shape to gift, but unfortunately, the phone arrived with deep unremovable scratches on the front glass, which is a bit odd because they are supposed to be gorilla-glass quality glass. Now Im having to attempt to re-purchase in hopes to get another one in better quality in time for Christmas, I hope this process becomes more effective.",Positive
271,"I new it was a refurbished item, however I made my homework reading several reviews and the warranty from the seller.I meets all the expectations except for the bluetooth. It performs with a very poor connection with any kind of device, either audio or any other type; connection with  get's dropped once and again at a short distance, less that a meter, so even my new generation headphones I had to be replaced by the old cord headphones from my old iPhone 7.For the rest it's ok, battery, camera, speakers, processing.If you don't mind to have this kind of issues for the price, then it's a good option, but if you cannot cope with it then do not risk your money and buy a new packaged item considering to pay in full.",Positive
272,"Ordered the 11 because I needed a new phone and without a doubt this was the best price for one.Shipped pretty fast and when it arrived it didn‚Äôt come in normal Apple packaging which I expected.Phone works perfectly but main complaint I had was the battery life wasn‚Äôt at 100, not too big of a deal, another complaint was there was a screen protector put on but it was pretty poorly installed doesn‚Äôt really effect anything just a little annoying.Personally I would recommend you to buy this as the phone came in amazing basically new condition and with the price I really can‚Äôt complain.",Positive
273,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Just bought this a few days ago. I really wanted to take car of it so I bought a waterproof case even before I got the phone. So here‚Äôs the thing the phone works like new but with just 1 big flaw. Every time someone calls me and I answer the call, the screen just shuts off and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do anything to it for a couple of minutes.it can last for at least 30 minutes. So the trick is I have to be the one to make the call that‚Äôs the way to stop it. I guess I can tolerate this but hopefully no more issues comes up.",Positive
274,"I thought I was going to be lucky. Usually I ignore reviews, DONT IGNORE! This phone was not fully unlocked and it had stated it was even in the settings. It lied, spent too much money trying to get it fixed. Not worth it at all. I am very disappointed, hope to get my money back or any sort of compensation. Don't go through the tears and trials that I did. Very upset with this product wish it was better.",Negative
275,Phone was in nice shape except for a few very light scratches on the screen. This is a known issue with the iPhone 11 so I was not surprised. The scratches are insignificant and can't be seen when the phone is being used. They are only visible when the screen is black. Shipping and communication were very good.Not an iPhone fan bought this for my wife and she likes it.,Positive
276,It‚Äôs very good. Packaging was poor but is good. Fully unlocked. It dies a hole lot quicker then the others I do say but not a big deal since there‚Äôs iPhone chargers everywhere in my house and car. The charger it came with crumbled in my hands the minute I touched it which was unusual. Very good not 5g though,Positive
277,"I had the phone for about a week and started noticing some issues with the Wi-Fi but would just reset my phone. One day the phone wouldn't let any calls or texts go through I ended up having to go to my phone carrier and see if they could help me and they got it working for a good 5-10min and the it went right back to not doing anything staying that there was no signal. I couldn't get onto any of my apps because there was no connection but when I went into the network settings, it said it was connected to the Wi-Fi. I'm very unclear about the issue but now I have to deal with sending it back to amazon and waiting to purchase the same kind through my phone carrier. I had bought an iPhone 7 off of Amazon and it works great still!",Positive
278,"As I tried to set up this phone, I found that certain letters on the keyboard were impossible to type. The screen just doesn't respond to touch in certain spots. I was unable to set up the phone, much less use it, because you have to enter your password and I couldn't type it. I will update this review once the seller responds to my complaint, but I am very frustrated that the phone was dysfunctional. Tech Exchangee's ""customer service"" number sends you to a random voicemail box.",Negative
279,This is the 2nd time I bought a iPhone from Amazon and just as my first I couldn‚Äôt be happier! I received a day early and seriously it‚Äôs just as good as brand new out the box! It didn‚Äôt have any scratches or defects. The price was Amazing! Thanks for a great phone at a even better price!,Positive
280,"2 days after receiving my device the phones camera went black. I bought apple insurance to get it fixed, now its doing something wonky with the keyboard. I might as well have bought it new from apple for the hassle. I decided to buy based on mixed reviews but most were positive, unfortunately it didnt work out for me.",Negative
281,I love it. Ordered yesterday and it was delivered today which is one day earlier than it was suppose to come. Everything is in perfect condition and it worked with metro. I had 0 issues. Switched from iPhone 8 Plus. I was very hesitant on buying because of some of the reviews saying it wasn‚Äôt fully unlocked. but I‚Äôm glad I bought it. üôÉ,Positive
282,The Best Phone I‚Äôve Ever Owned & I‚Äôm Very Satisfied With The Day & Night Quality ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüèæüëçüèæ,Positive
283,This product seems to work fine in the US. Someone told me my phone comes up from Mexico whenI called.  Not sure but I think that is the phone because I am using the same service that I have for years. I wish apple had left finger reader on iphone11.  The battery life is better then iphone7.Over all I am happy with this item.,Positive
284,Love the phone. It did not have a mark or flaw on it. Buy with confidence. Saved a lot of money. My only issue is that it‚Äôs not holding a charge. I upgraded from a 6 to an 11. Not one issue switching the phone from one to another. I have Straighttalk service. I am in heaven. Not missing the home button either!,Positive
285,I bought the phone refurbished and upon receipt I took it to tmobile to start service and the phone was blacklisted and reported stolen by the owner. I couldn't believe it.,Neutral
286,First off the Amazon driver dropped my package from his chest on my front door and left my ring door bell caught it all. My charger plug and cord damged and dirty. My glass screen protector cracked. My phone charged all night and died 5 minutes later. Waste of money.,Negative
287,"I know this is a second hand product but honestly I expected a device without visible scratches held at an arm‚Äôs length, as the description says. When I received the phone I immediately saw there was a lot of really noticeable scratches around the bumper. It came with a screen protector which is good, but I removed it to check the screen condition and I also found some scratches, fortunately that's a good way to hide them.So far the phone is 100% functional I haven't had any trouble, it's fully unlocked as advertised and it came with the battery life at 100% which is perfect!I bought this phone from BuySPRY and I'm giving this review just 3 stars due to the noticeable scratches. Just for reference I had the opportunity to buy another refurbished iPhone from Chubbiestech in the past and they sent me a mint condition device, unfortunately this seller wasn't available when I bought the iPhone 11 but it is now. Maybe you'll have to pay a little bit more but it's definitely worth it!",Positive
288,"I received this item today. I didn't receive retail packaging and I received an off brand charging brick and cord, I great but I could live with it. Went through all the trouble of activating the phone on my service to find out this phone gets üî• hot. I was making my mimoji and the phone started to heat up. This phone had on been on for 15 minutes. I had to send it back.",Positive
289,I‚Äôve had this pastel purple iPhone 11 now for over a year and I‚Äôm still very happy with it!! I upgraded from a iPhone 7+ to the 11. I got it with 256g of memory so it holds a lot. Battery and everything else is still going strong. Very happy with this purchase,Positive
290,"So far no complaints.  However, there's much to learn and no manual included or available from Apple (which I find reprehensible). So, being an iPhone 'newbie' I had to buy a written manual.  All I can say is, to use this thing properly , it will require A LOT of further study.  It's amazing all the things this phone can do!",Positive
291,"So far I'm pretty happy with the phone, I definitely prefer it over Android phones.  I don't have to use fingerprint reader so that's why the low review on that.  Only drawback I can't use my own ringtone/text message tones.  My boyfriend tried to and he said it was difficult.  I had to read up a little bit on how to use the phone.",Positive
292,"Although it‚Äôs a renew phone according what the headline says in the marketplace, I can say it‚Äôs a new phone. Beautiful and perfect presentation. This seller has a good service and a fast shipping option, I got my iPhone on time and hope the next one I buy would be under the same conditions both the phone and the shipping",Positive
293,Phone has been on this software update screen for 2 hours I can‚Äôt get to any other settings because it‚Äôs still saying updating  the phone was completely dead when I got it but it‚Äôs connected to Wi-Fi and is currently charged now with 50% battery so I‚Äôm not understanding why the phone is taking so long to update I even powered the phone off and tried again still the same results I will be returning it for a full refund phone has few scratches on front screen that aren‚Äôt really noticeable I can‚Äôt get in the phone to even see how everything else works and I‚Äôm tired of waiting on the software to download so I‚Äôm powering it back off and returning it,Negative
294,It worked and all but there was a few small scratches on it and I returned it. I had no problems with the return and luckily didn't have to pay to return the phone. Its a beautiful looking phone. I give it 3 stars because it is such a good phone and the return was easy and fair. I just hope they can be more diligent making sure there are no scratches on a phone before they send it.,Positive
295,"Well to begin with, he display glass they a installed on this ‚ÄúRenewed‚Äù iPhone 11 was priced right , as I tried to set it up, however I discovered why‚Ä¶ The display glass that they installed on the phone is not an Apple display there for several of the apps and a lot of the facial recognition feature don‚Äôt work and the error message just keeps flashing app on my phone it‚Äôs ridiculous I don‚Äôt recommend you by any of the renew towns from this company",Negative
296,Got the phone was super happy but the phone won‚Äôt turn on it‚Äôs stuck on a reboot loop I tried plugging it into the computer and updating it and restoring it and nothing worked had to update it then restore it then I was able to transfer it over it still works slow,Positive
297,Mine just came in today and man am I disappointed im not even going to turn it on 4-6 massive scratches on the phone visible from more than arms length away also looks like someone intentionally scratched it how did this make it past review,Negative
298,"I was kinda hesitant on buying bc of some of the reviews, but definitely made the right choice in ordering.No scratches & minimal damage on the frame for a refurbished phone. Definitely looks new.I got it on time! Even felt like it was super fast shipping.Came with charging cable & box AND was super surprised it had a screen protector.Definitely is unlocked & had no issues connecting to my carrier. Phone seems to work perfect so far.SUPER GLAD I UPGRADED FROM MY IPHONE 7!This product is so good, I‚Äôm recommending to all that will listen lol!",Positive
299,Paid a considerable premium with the promise of like-new quality and over 90% battery health... It was neither.,Positive
300,"Value for money-I love this phone with all my heart even though I just got it like 4 days ago it‚Äôs amazing I haven‚Äôt had trouble with it AT ALL,it was fully unlocked so the only thing I had to do was transfer my SIM card from my old phone to this phone .There is a minor problem on the front camera when taking pics and vids there‚Äôs like a faded red light while take pics ,but nobody really can see it tbh",Positive
301,No issues with the phone. It did get here a little late but that was fault of the shipping company,Negative
302,"Bought it because my mom needed one and they were out of stock at Apple. But it came with a very scratched screen, battery only charges up to 80%. Price was way to high. I might return it if I‚Äôm able to come back home within the return period.",Positive
303,"Not gonna lie; I was sooooo skeptical about ordering a renewed phone... it took me maybe 4 or 5 days of reading EVERY review, checking ALL ratings and so on and then just basically said screw it we‚Äôll cross that bridge when we get to it.WELL, let‚Äôs just say... the phone was PERFECT!! Not a single scratch, crack, blemish.. like seriously looks like it‚Äôs brand new. EVERYTHING works BEAUTIFULLY on this phone including the camera and I am VERY VERY impressed. The ONLY issue I do have is the batter life... it takes FOREVER TO  FREAKING CHARGE to where you see green but it‚Äôs something I willing to deal with considering I paid a good price and everything about this is damn near brand new",Positive
304,"This product claimed that the phone was like new, and it was not at all as advertised. The phone had a very noticeable scratch on the back, which is annoying, but what really got to me is that the camera doesn't work. Whenever I open the camera to use it, the camera keeps attempting (and failing) to adjust. It vibrates the phone profusely and makes it so that I can only use the front facing camera on this phone. Absolutely not worth the price.",Negative
305,"Phone arrived today. Almost flawless. Minor scuff on one of the top corners. A little concerned that the Battery life was at 87% capacity. Other than that , it was easy to get my service switched to this device. I did it myself online. Love that it came with a screen protector already installed on the device.",Positive
306,Do not waste your money on this phone. It says internationally unlocked but it's crap. It is not reliable. One minute it works the next minute no service. The phone came with the screen chipped around the edge and it has been downstream since. The sellers are terrible.,Negative
307,"It says ""like new"" but the phone that came was heavily used, covered in scratches and could not ever pass as like new. The packaging was also covered in fingerprints and just looked really dirty. I was buying it as a birthday gift for someone but could never give this to them. I wouldn't use it myself either this is not at all worth the amount paid. I will have to return it now and will not be able to give them a birthday gift. Very upset",Positive
308,"Got this phone for my daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it. Works great, so far no problems.",Positive
309,"First of all, it is false advertisement! I received my phone today and the phone is not unlocked! The seller needs to stop playing w/ people's money and lying because we don't have it like that to be going back and forth with this. I advise you to just get a new one.",Negative
310,"Phone works fine, light wear on the glass but still a great value compared to new. I activated it on AT&T loving it so far. It replaced my 6s so I was due to upgrade. Would recommend 10/10",Positive
311,"Acceptable performance for the price. Heavy and clunky compared to the Pixel 3a I was using before this iPhone 11, plus the camera isn't any better than what I had with my $250 Pixel -- both shoot decent wide angle photos and video, decent processing capabilities, and both have crappy digital zoom functionality. Mostly got this for the better integration with hearing aids.",Positive
312,I was so worried about buying a phone from here (iPhone 11) . It‚Äôs for my sons birthday and I haven‚Äôt given it to him yet so I‚Äôm not sure how it‚Äôs operating but it looks nearly brand new and it‚Äôs charging to 100%. I‚Äôll update if there‚Äôs any problems but I have a feeling all will be fine.,Positive
313,Didn‚Äôt realize that it didn‚Äôt have an EarPod hookup. Now I am waiting for a separate attachment to use for audiobooks.  Recommend including this piece of information in product description for tech challenged buyers to know at time of purchase,Neutral
314,I gave this a 5/5 because the phone came in perfect shape not even a scratch on it the battery has 100% of it life and came delivered nicely.,Positive

  ¬†It doesn‚Äôt have fingerprint sensor battery life is good I was having issues with the face recognition or I probably just need to reset but it‚Äôs a great phone no problems or complications since I bought it",Positive
316,"There were 3 noticeable scratches on the back of the phone, which I don‚Äôt mind cuz I‚Äôm putting a case on. It did not come in the original apple box or come with the apple charger. The battery capacity was 90%. Other than that the screen looks like new, the face recognition and the camera works fine.It‚Äôs a refurbished phone so you get what you get. You won‚Äôt know the condition of the phone until you get it. I was looking for a relatively new phone for a cheaper price so I don‚Äôt mind with the phone I got, but if scratches and battery life are a concern for you, you might want to buy it from apple refurbished or just get a new phone.",Positive
317,I love it.,Positive
318,I dislike. I didn‚Äôt have an issue until it got stuck in a boot loop and apple tech couldn‚Äôt even fix it! 700$ wasted. Returning and getting a refund. Plus didn‚Äôt even come with a chargerüò°,Negative
319,"came with a screen protector & non working off brand charger. scratches on back glass & dents on buffer. recently put a new screen protector on & noticed the front  screen is completely wrecked with scratches. i bought refurbished, unlocked, 128gb, purple iphone 11. could be worse but not totally happy. i‚Äôve bought several refurnished phone & this is definitely the worst i received. battery health good tho. works really well all in all. takes great pics. works as it should but cosmetically not worth 450$.. clean IMEI, did have to connect to a computer to properly reset.",Positive
320,"I had been looking everywhere for an unlocked iPhone 11 but they were hard to find. The refurbished price was about $800, unless I wanted to risk eBay. This was such a great deal and the phone works perfectly. It came in 4 days, was packaged carefully, and no problems at all.",Positive
321,I went to the store to get this phone set up twice and both times they said it wasn‚Äôt fully unlocked.,Neutral
322,"Phone works great but it has some minor scratches and an unfortunate ding on the bottom. Not too big of a deal for a refurbished phone. But the final price of $500 is a bit high for a used phone. I only got this one due to it being a lot faster than waiting for new ones to be in stock, if they even still make them.",Positive
323,"Value for the money, it had a couple of scratches in the back but barely noticeable otherwise the phone runs good fully unlocked looks almost like new . The only complain I have about this phone is that the charger that comes with it, is not an Apple charger is just those cheap chargers you could buy at the dollar store. it does charge with it, but be ready to buy a new one soon after",Positive
324,Didn‚Äôt come in original apple box and definitely not an apple charger. Micro scratches all over screen but barely noticeable until in light. Didn‚Äôt come with SIM card extracter but a paper clip works fine. Other than that it works greatüòÑ,Positive
325,"It‚Äôs not bad for a refurbished phone however, I would call this grade B refurbished. Most refurbished items I buy come from Walmart and I never have a problem. They always seem to be in perfect condition. It did come with a tempered glass which was a plus but when I went to put it on I immediately noticed lots of scratches on the screen. I‚Äôm assuming the screen was never replaced. The battery life is at 90% which means they don‚Äôt replace the batteries either. I‚Äôm a little disappointed with my experience because I‚Äôve never had this happen before. I recommend if you are wanting something more ‚Äúnew‚Äù like because this is DEFINITELY in used condition.",Positive

327,Arrived well packaged with charger. Looked brand new--not a mark on it. Worked perfectly from the get go and a month later no issues or glitches. Teenage granddaughter is on it constantly and no complaints about battery life. Would definitely buy agsin.,Positive

329,"I purchased this phone as a xmas gift for my granddaughter.  Looked great, worked etc.  This week without being dropped, wet, or anything suddenly the battery literally swelled which caused the face of the phone to fall off.

332,"Considering the number of reviews of many internet items being way off the mark regarding condition I was pleasantly surprised, when I opened the package to find the the phone, in what i consider, to be in perfect condition  - the phone is virtually unmarked with no scratches or blemishes , and everything functions as per the factory specs. I would definitely buy again from this seller and recommend to other potential buyers.For a quality item with a reasonable price and fast shipping, I would rate this transaction  A+",Positive
333,The phone came in defected when the volume adjust itself. I put the volume up for incoming calls and it does whatever it wants sometimes it rings high other times it rings really low and other times it rings ones then turns silent.  I‚Äôm so angry cuz it was used and payed full price and it doesn‚Äôt even work correctly.,Negative
334,"Worked as advertised.  As a refurbished iPhone, you are always worried that it may not work as well as a new iPhone.  I have been pleasantly surprised with the overall condition and performance of the device.  The savings and the warranty were attractive enough for me to take the risk.  Based on my experience so far, I would do it again.",Positive

338,Good,Positive

340,"Great phone, could not tell it was refurbished, came with a screen protector on it. The only bummer is that it did not come with ear pods but I noticed Apple is no longer giving those out either, so it's all good! It turned out to $40 cheaper than a new phone, and with some Amazon credits I had I would up getting a $600 phone for about $420, go refurb!",Positive
341,"There are a lot of scraches on the phone case, and small scraches on the screen, actually a lot, but screen is generally fine.(Only part I'm satisfied is screen)I dont care about scraches, but battery life is abslutely unacceptable.You only give me 1% battery life with 19% already lost to have to change to another battery?if 85%, 87% is worst situation but I can accept, but 81%, seriously?Since it's a gift I gave to a friend in Spain, I'm not gonna return it,but it's very disappointing the battery life, and the case also exaggeratingly scrached.",Negative
342,It one of my best purchases ever!! it came in a box and it looked like new. I couldn't find any scratches even being used. It came with a compatible charger and the key to open the sim card compartment. It works amazingly. Totally recommended!,Positive
343,"The phone's touch screen completely non-functional out of the box. There were no cracks but since the device didn't register any touch, I was never able to get past the initial setup screen (even after restarts). In their defense, they did offer a refund though unfortunately I was too busy to send it in time. I'm not saying all of their phones come broken but I figure it's worth mentioning that mine was.",Negative
344,Product came in earlier than expected. These iPhones are good as new and I recommend these to anyone looking to purchase an iPhone. I bought 1 for myself and another for my girlfriend and they were both beautiful and in perfect condition. I was also pleased to see that both came with a screen protector installed. I am very satisfied with this product and I suggest this product to anybody looking to get a basically brand new iPhone for a better price.,Positive
345,"La verdad que al ser un telefono renovado pude recuperar toda la informacion de otro iphone lo que es genial aun no puedo hablar de la bateria lo estoy cargando, venia cin algunos raspones pero con una proteccion no se notaran, por el momento estoy feliz, dire algo mas cuando lo prube mas dias  funciona muy bien en chile",Neutral
346,Phone as described I definitely recommend this product no noticeable dents or scratches on the screen. Does show wear but only when closely inspected not just from looking at the phone. So far it‚Äôs good this is my first day using the device so if anything changes I‚Äôll update my review.,Positive
347,"The first phone i received looks great, but had countless issues. The ""i"" key wouldnt work, the phone wouldnt charge intermittently, the screen would freeze every few hours. Very annoying issues. Decided to get a replacement and the shipment has been delayed 3x now. Will be sending this one back and be out of a phone for at least a week. Will report back when I get the replacement. My family has bought refurbished phones multiple times with no issue, but I had to write an honest review so far.",Positive
348,This phone crashes multiple times a day. I‚Äôve had it for less than a year and it‚Äôs already severely malfunctioning. It needs to be rebooted multiple times a day for it to even make a call. Definitely a bad product sold by the seller.,Negative
349,At first I was hesitant to buy an iPhone over the Internet but to my amazement this is one of the best purchases I‚Äôve ever made.  Phone looks brand new no scratches no dents everything works flawlessly.  I bought the iPhone 11 in purple and I can‚Äôt believe all the things it does compared to my iPhone 7.  Stop searching you‚Äôve found your new iPhone from this company!!,Positive
350,"Great value, screen sometimes doesn‚Äôt want to operate like it freezes up sometimes and I have to close out of the app I was in or sometimes it‚Äôs slow a little but I can live with it. Everything is in perfect working order and screen is in great condition came with a screen protector. Awesome phone, wish the battery life was a little longer though, last maybe two-three hours using it. Checking my phone and going on every now and then last about ten hours, so not too bad.",Positive
351,"I've had the phone for about 16 hours.  Nothing but trouble right from the start.  It keeps restarting itself and shutting the screen off randomly.  I spent over an hour troubleshooting with Apple. They said that it's probably bad software.  I'm sure iPhone 11s are great, just don't waste your money buying it from Amazon.  Buy refurbished directly from Apple.  That way you have options if it doesn't work (other than wasting your time returning it.)",Positive
352,I love my new iphone! The video quality is so good and there are so many accessories that i can get to go with it. People can't believe i shoot all my IG content on this phone or how fast I produce the content. Between the audio accessories I bought and music features on garageband I shoot and edit right in Imovie which has green screen features now and export so quickly. I even shot a music video in my GARAGE that no one believed was actually my garage because Imovie did such a dope job with it's green screen. Highly recommend especially for this refurbished price.,Positive
353,Overall the phone is nice but little things like me constantly getting notifications because the screen was repaired not at an apple facility or my AirPods breaking up and disconnecting constantly (when they are new and it worked just fine on my old phone) those things annoy me anything else is fine,Positive
354,THIS PHONE IS LOCKED !!!!!! do not buy from this person i‚Äôm not satisfied,Negative
355,AT&T turned off my service because phone reported stolen. Now wife had to go back to her old phone. I have to go to buy new phone now. Can‚Äôt believe Amazon sell stolen property.,Positive
356,I was skeptical getting the phone but for the price it works perfectly it does everything an apple product is supposed to. Now it didn‚Äôt come in the original packaging which I didn‚Äôt mind. And the charging cable is long which I find a bonus. Overall I love it,Positive
357,"The best phone for the BEST price, BuySpry really did it again. Second time buying from them and honestly they did not disappoint. Battery life is at 100% health, screen, body of the phone are completely unharmed as if I had just bought it straight from apple. Also, it even came with tempered glass already on the screen which is an added plus!! I'm so so happy I purchased my phone here.",Positive
358,"Bought this unlocked iPhone with skepticism after reading the reviews. The phone looks like brand new, no scratches. Bought a SIM card from my phone carrier and so far has met my expectations. I only charge it once a day which is great, compared to the other iPhones I had. Purple color is beautiful, looks more like lavender. Amazon customer tech support was very helpful and even connected me with Apple support to obtain help with the data transfer from my old phone. A great buy at a reasonable price!",Positive
359,"I was hesitant to get a ""renewed"" phone, but it has worked just as well as advertised.  I'm very happy with it and would renewed again.",Positive
360,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†It‚Äôs a good phone but the reason why I give it 4 stars is because I had to unlocked the FaceTime and imessages ( from turning green ) on. If have any of those difficulties please contact apple right away and they‚Äôll help you. You‚Äôll thank me in the future. üíØif you notice , the purple phone always tends to work better than the other colors phone by looking at these reviews.",Positive
361,Llego pronto.en buenas condiciones,Negative
362,"This phone appears to work well, but I was quite disappointed by the appearance. The screen and phone case are very scratched up. If I didn't need a phone immediately I would have sent it back. REally expected a nicer looking phone.",Negative
363,"I chose this seller because of 100% positive feedback but my phone is not compatible with the carrier it was sold as being exclusively for. When I tried to activate the phone I found out it is incompatible with my AT&T SIM card. I spent 2 hours on chat with support but they were just talking in circles and I was never convinced they even understood the problem. If someone pays almost $500 for an item, it should be as described. Further, there was extensive cosmetic damage. I honestly would've overlooked the damage if the phone had actually worked.",Positive
364,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†I knew it was a shot in the dark ordering. When phone arrived. Looked okay. Had lots of scratches and the back camera was chipped. When trying to set up the phone, would not update to the latest IOS. Would not let you skip around. Gave option to return in exchange for new phone. Hope that one is functioning.",Positive
365,My husband is not very techie.  He only wants a phone that works and did not want to pay a high price for a new IPhone.  The warranty is good on this and he is just fine with a refurbished one.,Positive
366,"Fast shipping works just like new no scratches or anything in particular so far so good,I recently bought (2) from different sellers and I had to send it back within days.,fingers cross I would recommend it to anyone who has problems like me in the past with others sellers this renewed are basically new ones üëç",Positive
367,"When I was looking for a new phone, I didn‚Äôt care that it was renewed. I‚Äôve never had problems with renewed phones. So I came here first. I saw so many misleading things about these phones. But I made the purchase anyway. The phone came with 97% battery life, no scratches, no dents, and it was completely unlocked. Basically brand new. And I LOVE IT. I nervously waited for the package. And when i finally got it and everything was perfectly fine with it. I was amazed. So many people had said, so many misleading things. But truth is? IT AMAZING. GO FOR IT!",Positive
368,My phone arrived earlier than expected.  I am almost 82 and I was able ON MY OWN set up the new phone and transfer all the data from my older phone to the new.  I'm very happy with my Iphone 11,Positive
369,I wasn‚Äôt sure that I wanted to change phones but this iphone11 is a dream. I didn‚Äôt realize how good it would be and I am now an iPhone lover. The seller was super.,Positive
370,My Face ID didn‚Äôt work. My front portrait mode doesn‚Äôt work They offered to replace but I would have had to send the whole phone back in order to replace which would‚Äôve left me with no phone until they decided rather on rather not they would fix/replace it . So sad such a bummer not having Face ID,Negative
371,I know it was a renewed phone but for the money you still expect a decent phone. This one was full with small scratches on the back and even two bigger ones in the front‚Ä¶I sent it back immediately‚Ä¶,Positive
372,"I bought the phone for my 16yr old daughter she loves the phone, we ask for yellow they ran out, but he made sure to call me and ask what else color so my daughter pick green, it‚Äôs cute minor scratches but nothing serious. It‚Äôs fully unlocked and works perfectly.. this is the 3rd One I have purchase through this seller never disappointed.",Positive

374,"Had to immediately have battery replaced and now have to go get whole thing fixed as it keeps just shutting off.  Amazon is reimbursing for charges to get it fixed, but what a pain! I use my phone for work and this has been a big hassle.  Very disappointed",Negative
375,"Purchased this phone for relative who was leaving the country and needed an unlocked phone while traveling overseas. It was shipped fast, arrived on time but was very disappointing  to see very clear signs of wear and tear. The phone had scratches everywhere, which you would expect since it wasn‚Äôt new but a huge scratch on the top right side of the screen was shocking. The phone actually looked like it had been abused. I wanted to return it but couldn‚Äôt because the person whom it was for had to leave the country the next day.",Negative
376,"When I got the the phone i was able to put my iCloud on and everything else but when I put in a SIM card it would not read my data, took it to the T-Mobile store and the IMEI on the phone was locked meaning the person who had it before did not pay off the phone and the provider locked the IMEI and the phone can only be used on wifi.",Positive
377,I was realllllyyyy scared to purchase a phone off of Amazon at first. I had it in my cart for days but I‚Äôm glad I decided to go ahead and purchase this. I‚Äôve been having the phone for over 6 months and have had 0 problems. I was able to activate it with my phone provider with no issues as well. No regrets at all.,Positive
378,phone was great com card would fit in com card tray had to return so far have not received A refund Will not re-order until I receive a refund the phone itself looked great but was of no value if you cannot use it as a telephone patiently waiting for a refund,Positive
379,"Perfect product! I was a little worried when first buying this product due to it being refurbished but it works great just like brand new! Not one scratch or mark and if your has one on it, it possibly could have came from the delivery truck or processor rather than the manufacturer. I‚Äôm very pleased with this purchase and I would recommend this product to anyone who does not want to spend 1,000 just on a phone.",Positive
380,"Do not buy, this phone is a junk.Mine arrived with a bad screen installed.",Negative
381,"I don‚Äôt really know why,  but when my IPhone 7 Plus started giving me trouble and I needed a new phone, I let someone talk me into trying an android. 2 weeks later I returned the android. I love my IPhones too much! This IPhone 11 is so nice. I absolutely love the face recognition. I bought the yellow and it is so pretty. The size is perfect!",Positive
382,"You Might be skeptical of getting a renewed phone, but so far mine has had no noticeable issues or differences from a brand new one. Even physically, it was flawless; no scratches on the screen or dents or anythin. As far as I‚Äôm concerned, I basically got a new IPhone for 100 dollars off so I‚Äôm pretty happy with it.",Positive
383,"I can not coment on the actual performance, except to say that If you are an Apple user this is a good choice. My friend did not like the xr. This one has huge storage capacity, retina display, and there are plenty of accessory items available.",Positive
384,I have yet to be disappointed with this phone!!! Yes... took me a minute to get used to the phone/screen size comparing an iPhone 7 but hands down... Good job Apple and good job Amazon for a clean... refurbished product that works so flush üëåüèºThe data transfer via Cloud was super fast and easy. Probably the best I‚Äôve dealt with yet.Screen resolution... keyboard tranquility... overall battery & performance?? Forget about it... because this device has it all !!!!,Positive
385,"Super skeptical after the 1 star reviews, but hey 90 Amazon money back I figure what the heck. Great product basically new batter capacity is 100% no problems with the phone. I got a t mobile specific phone swapped the sim and off I went. Nice product",Positive
386,"Phone arrived quickly, it looked brand new. It even had a screen protector and AppleCare for the next 6 months which we didn‚Äôt know we were getting either. Also, the charger it came with looks to be a fast charger and it does charge the phone super fast. The only con is that the battery life is already at 86, but that is expected considering it‚Äôs refurbished. We were a little hesitant considering there wasn‚Äôt too many reviews, but so far we are extremely happy with the product. We will buy from seller again in the future.",Positive
387,"I recommend to anyone who is going to invest their money in this not to buy it, they are not supposed to sell damaged things, buy one of these and it would turn on and off by itself, so it is useless to sell something damaged",Negative
388,"I ordered this phone because I was due for a new one, and I needed more storage space. I came across this one and I thought it was a great deal but was nervous about it being renewed. I read all the reviews and the only doubts I had was when the battery life wasn‚Äôt at 100%, with the phone being renewed, it states very clearly that it wouldn‚Äôt come in the original Apple box or the Apple charger and cube. So when the reviews were bad about that, it was clear they didn‚Äôt read the complete description. I went ahead and purchased and was very pleased with it! The phone came with 100% battery life, the screen was perfect, and I was overall very pleased! I highly recommend this phone and company!",Positive
389,"It was working fine battery life was more than anticipated at 96 instead of the advertised 85-90 I believe, but after about 40 days the phone would restart like it had no battery left even though it was at 100% or while it was charging. Everything else was fine and id probably still buy another phone from the company.",Positive
390,"Decided to go the refurbished route after buying new phones up to this point. I am very pleased with the phone (iPhone 11 128gb). It looks and performs like a new phone, for a significant savings. The battery health is at 85%, but that is more than enough to last a full day and then some.",Positive
391,"The phone arrived ahead of schedule, but it was immediately and clearly obvious that one of the rear camera lenses was cracked in multiple places (which was helpfully covered by a gross dirt-streaked sticker). The seller's ""certified"" / ""renewed"" product label is dubious, at best. Here's to hoping that their returns process works better than the eyesight of whoever ""certifies"" their phones...",Positive
392,"Phone came on good started up fine after a few hours of usage the entire screen had horizontal lines and battery life was on 87 percent on it, didn‚Äôt fall or anything like that lines just appeared don‚Äôt waste your time buying this phone very bad service",Negative
393,"I just messaged the seller, and hoping to hear from them soon.The phone came super quick, which is amazing. I was able to figure out how to transfer my info super fast and I was happy to be saving money and causing less damage to the planet. However, the camera must be damaged as it takes pictures with a dark spot in the picture. And now the keyboard is lagging. I hope they are able to work with me to either send me another one or fix this one.",Positive
394,the entire phone it was broke and was scratched up bad when i got it,Negative
395,"I just received this phone today for my daughter and their are no scratches and everything went smoothly with transferring her old phone to that one but 3 hours later it started glitching. I tried to turn it off but it wouldn‚Äôt even do that. We tried for about 10 minutes then just gave up. When came back to it about 3 minutes later, it was fine. So I will be keeping a eye on it and let you know the updates tomorrow",Positive
396,"In good condition. No scratches, came with a screen protector.The only problem is that it has turned off a couple of times when I least expect it after having it less than a month, it turns right back on, but it is a major inconvenience. I had to find a repair shop near me to fix it. Since I use my phone for work, I cannot be without one. I contacted the seller and was only refunded $20 (I kept the phone for my work)I recommend that if you do get a used phone, to double-check everything before getting rid of your old one.",Positive
397,Excuse my nails lol but it works good as you can tell im using it I had the xs and been wanting the 11 it is a tiny bit bigger I love the color. Not a scratch nor nothing on here nor dirty I would say it‚Äôs straight out the original box im satisfied with my purchase and the switch to metro was easy,Positive
398,"I ordered the iPhone 11 64 gb tied to my carrier which is AT&T. I‚Äôm honestly shocked at what great condition the phone is in locks practically new no scuffs or scratches on the screen or anywhere on the body of the phone. I just popped my SIM card out of my old phone and into this one everything seems to be In working order. Very happy with the purchase face recognition works great, camera‚Äôs work great, battery life solid. I was pleasantly surprised.",Positive
399,We thought it worked cause it turned on and we transferred data. It gets hot and turns off completely during calls or texting and also when I‚Äôm not even using it I can see it turn on and off. Setup the facial recognition but since it turns off so much it always needs the manual code. Definitely requesting a return.,Positive
400,"As always, I was a bit skeptical about ordering a $800 phone off amazon but I‚Äôm so glad I did. It even came with a screen protector and it came brand new, only a tiny scratch on the screen protector but other then that the phone was spotless. So happy with what I got and happy it saved me a couple $100. The phone also came unlocked and had no trouble switching it over to my network. 10/10!",Positive
401,The accessory came with this phone is very cheap made in China type.Also the box.. I don't recommend this at all.,Positive
402,I won hundred percent absolutely love my phone it came with a good battery no nicks no dings no scratches just a perfect phone camera is great have no issues with my phone delivery was smooth transfer was smooth absolutely would buy another phone from this company,Positive

No scratches or defects. Battery was charged at 65%.  Inserted the Mint Mobile sim card and within seconds we could receive texts and calls. Everything works perfect,Positive
404,I was skeptical to order a phone from Amazon but I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered Prime and it arrived even earlier than it said. The phone looked absolutely brand new with one very minor scratch you can only see if you examine really close. I would buy again. Came with 90% battery health,Positive
405,Do not buy.There is a three month warranty which ended three days ago and now the phone stopped working.It didn't last!It's a dud!,Neutral
406,Screen had black spot lower right corner. SIM card port didn‚Äôt work verified by apple support. Apple support was the one who urged me to get a refund or exchange. 70 dollars more for a brand new iPhone will save you a lot of headache.,Positive
407,Everything on the outside of this phone was just okay until I switched it ON and used it for a couple hours. This cellphone couldn't stay ON for longer than 30 minutes and kept restarting/booting itself repeatedly. The operating system was stuck on the oldest version and refused to accept any updates. Complete LEMON! Avoid this seller at all costs!,Positive
408,I‚Äôve had this phone for 3months and it has started to glitch and freeze. Buy the warranty package. I purchased another phone with the warranty protection package and I forgot to add the warranty to this phone as well. :(((( the phone works well enough just a minor annoyance.,Negative
409,Wife loves this phone and me too. The only phone I like better is s20ultra. She got red and the finish is beautiful. Call quality stood out from previous phones as it is exceptionally loud n clear. Sounds like the people you're talking to are right in front of you,Positive
410,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†I really liked the packaging that the phone came in. Everything was wrapped, and sealed neatly. I would honestly get as much gigabytes as possible so your phone has enough space, and storage. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I should buy this phone because it is amazon renewed, but they did a great job. Battery life was perfect, screen and all is functional. Make sure you have a SIM card for the phone. The value is kind of expensive but it‚Äôs worth it, also the phone is fully unlocked and that is very important!. Thank you!",Positive

I bought the unlocked version and I have T-Mobile. I‚Äôve had the phone for about a month no issues. T-Mobile was able to easily connect it with my old number. My only issue is that my google accounts keep asking me for my password. Not sure if that‚Äôs a phone issue or a gmail issue.",Positive

419,First one we got kept turning off. Return was painless but having to transfer data from old phone to new phone TWICE was a little inconvenient. Now satisfied.,Positive
420,"sin duda alguna ha sido una de las mejores compras que hecho Celular vino muy bien empaquetado tra√≠a un cargador y cubo para cargar muy bueno La condici√≥n de la bater√≠a es excelente yo cre√≠ que iba ser menos por ser reacondicionado pero tiene un 95% de bater√≠a  Y en la parte f√≠sica del tel√©fono lo veo muy bien est√°n muy bonitos tal vez tiene unos peque√±os raspones y Rayones en la pantalla pero son casi nulos ,  Y si funcion√≥ el desbloqueo de la banda as√≠ que s√≥lo puedo decir que es la mejor compra que he hecho y que recomiendo mucho al comprador buyspring",Neutral

423,"I wouldnt pay more than $100 for this thing. They've obviously done a terrible job fixing whatever issue this phone had in the refurbishing process. The thing is so slow it crashes when scrolling through simple apps like Twitter or Instagram. Need to back up your photos? Forget it, impossible on this thing. Quite literally unusable for anything but calls. Absolute waste of money. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SELLER.",Negative

428,When i received the Verizon 64 gigabyte version it could not be activated because it was a fraudulent device.,Neutral
429,So far so good! I needed to upgrade my phone for awhile and postponed. This was such a. Great deal on a refurbished phone. A 36 month contract with a phone carrier to get a similar phone would have cost me double.,Positive

I found this phone and pulled the trigger. I'm always worried about possible issues when spending this kind of money. I'm happy to say the phone is working great after 4 months. The camera is fantastic and shots with low light is no longer a problem. I use the phone with strava so it gets good use while I'm cycling. I'll buy another iphone from this seller when the time comes.,Positive

Cosmeticaly the phone didnt't have scratches or dents but it could have been cleaner, such as the ear piece and speakers. I tired to clean it but wasn't so successful.

457,The phone works great! It was fully unlocked. I have had no trouble setting it up. I highly recommend. The price is great for the phone. It works like n new phone. The Face ID works great. There was no starches. It is is good shape. The batter life was at 86. Which is great for a used phone. The shipping was packed very well. It came with a charger & a screen protector. It also came with a thing to take your sims card out which is great.,Positive
458,I‚Äôm IN LOVE with this phone and the fact that it‚Äôs like brand new and unlocked just made it better for me. Seriously it was like buying a brand spanking new iPhone for a much lower price. The camera quality is why I wanted this phone to begin with but everything else just makes the phone so great. I‚Äôm very happy!,Positive
459,"The phone was amazing honestly, it came early and was very easy to setup. Battery life isn‚Äôt all the way full but it‚Äôs ok, it came with a screen protector on it with a couple of scratches wasn‚Äôt visible at first but it‚Äôs ok again. Had no possible issues so far and hoping for the rest of time until I have a new phone! Was very nervous of buying at first but glad I did it! Went from iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone 11 glad for the upgrade.",Positive

461,Oh well.The phone works great.  no problems.  would have preferred to get brand new....  Pd $700...  if I'd only known then What I know now...  July 9 - Sept. 9.....  2 months and I could've gotten brand new from my cellular provider for $590,Positive
462,"I was kind of skeptical at first to buy it, I know amazon it‚Äôs quality, but read some experiences that went wrong and I was scared it was going to be the same for me, but I took the chance and I have 0 regrets. I got the phone in nearly mint condition, I cannot see any scratches, the battery is at 100% and the face ID works just fine. Have been with my new phone for 2 weeks and everything works perfect. I love it and I loved the price and it came with a screen protector installed and all. 100% worth my money, helping the planet and saving some money.",Positive
463,"My boyfriend just bought me this phone as a late anniversary gift since he knew I had been wanting one, it came unlocked as it was stated. I wish it didn‚Äôt have little bits of scratches in the corners shown in the pictures but once I put a case on it won‚Äôt matter. I also would of liked the battery life to be 100% but again, I‚Äôm just glad it looks as good as it does and I appreciate that it even already had a screen protector on it. And it came super fast! Thanks so much (:",Positive
464,Amazing find for a present! The person loved their gift and got it for a great price. Easy to transfer info onto new phone and everything runs smoothly! Thanks,Positive

466,"la bateria estaba gastada y no fue informado, no se envio el cargador original y tampoco el cable original",Positive
467,"Well I wasn't going to write a review but hopefully it'll help someone in the future...I bought this phone for my son and took it to our carrier who informed me that this phone wasn't unlocked and had 2 MEI numbers we even called Apple who then informed us that the phone would only work overseas. I returned it without a problem and received a full refund, which I'm very thankful for because this phone wasn't cheap and it kept powering on and off by itself which was unusual.",Positive
468,"El dispositivo llego en una caja de restauracion de amazon, tiene todas las funciones perfectas y estaba liberado para ser usado con cualquiera telefonica a nivel mundial recomiendo comprar estos dispositivos restaurados por amazon.",Neutral

470,This item wasn't new it came with scratches.please do not buy.,Positive
471,It was exactly as described.  Should have paid attention to the memory amount but that was my own fault. Love the red.  And the camera is outstanding,Positive
472,"A good product for value. I found other phones that were $30-$60 cheaper, and this phone did come with some slight cosmetic problems on the body. But overall I chose to go with this product due to 1)it coming with accessories, 2) it had the option of getting a protection warranty, and 3) it being an Amazon trusted item with the ability to return.Battery life is at 91% capacity which is good.",Positive
473,I was very hesitant due to ‚Äúit‚Äôs too good to be true‚Äù old saying. But honestly it works like new with a minor set back. Siri doesn‚Äôt respond to voice so me saying ‚Äú HEY SIRI‚Äù doesn‚Äôt do much. Weirdly enough it does activate randomly to loud coughs. Which is strange but this is an on off deal. I really enjoy it. Besides the Siri dearer there‚Äôs a chip of paint near the bottom lens that would frustrate someone with OCD. Overall good buy. I lucked out.,Positive
474,"Llego en muy buenas condiciones, solo un detalle en la esquina un rasponcito y un ligero ara√±aso en la pantalla pero que ni se nota, ademas la bateria llego con el 96%. Recomiendo este vendedor",Neutral
475,This phone was order came today and can you believe the phone doesn't even turn on what type a business is this crazy. I placed it on charge still nothing rubbish. I'm returning this and I need my money back. Everyone please don't purchase EVER from this seller,Negative
476,The only the thing I didn‚Äôt like is the charger it came with I‚Äôm going to be honest that charger I could have gone without it it takes so long to charge the phone but otherwise everything was smooth,Positive
477,"The product arrived a day early. Nice. The phone was in excellent condition, no scratches on phone nor screen. Fully charged, I went to ATT and got a SIM card, took minutes and free. Since I lost my phone and did not backup, my fault, I had to download apps and do my own email stuff.  The phone is nice with works well.  Very happy, only had it one day, but we are off to a great start!",Positive
478,"Over all excellent condition battery life was 85% which is is still decent, return policy is great if there are any issues",Positive
479,Pro‚Äôs about the purchase: Phone arrived a day earlier than expected and was in excellent condition and even had a screen protector on the screen so that was a plusCons about the purchase: The phone had a bad SIM card reader in it and would not read my SIM card even after taking to AT&T for a new Sim so I had to take it to a repair shop and pay an additional $80 for a repair in order for my SIM card to work,Positive
480,I have to be up front and say I wasn‚Äôt sure about this at first. It was a lot of money to pay. Considering it‚Äôs my first iPhone coming from android. I got the iPhone 11 fully unlocked in black and it was super easy to get activated. A fast charger came with it no headphones but I use truly wireless earbuds so I‚Äôm good. My final verdict is buy the phone it will be a great investment. My experience has been so great my woman wanted one so we‚Äôre currently waiting for it to come in the mail.,Positive
481,"I bought this phone about a year ago, immediately i noticed that it was garbage. the screen on the phone would bug out and start making calls, pressing buttons, swiping, tapping on everything by itself. i took it to the shop and they told me the phone had already been fixed multiple times by someone else. i understand it was used, but it said ‚Äúlike new‚Äù when i bought it. i had to throw it out within weeks.",Positive
482,It‚Äôs nice and I definitely understand it was used but you literally could have said the microphone is some how clogged up and people barely hear me and it didn‚Äôt even come with headphones I might return it I don‚Äôt know but hey I phone 11 woo hoo..,Positive
483,This was a great value for us. On our iPhone 7 it used the fingerprint the iPhone 11 uses face Recognition I love it!! Also no home button. You just swipe so much easier!! I actually bought two of them one red and one black fir my husband. They both look and act like new phones. Only way to go!!,Positive
484,The device came in an original box and was in great (like-new) condition. No scrathches at all. The charger is off-brand and charges a bit slow. Get yourself an OEM charger or something more powerful if you don't have one already.,Positive
485,The regular iPhone 11 is small for me. Therefore I returned it. I am a former Android owner so using a iPhone is way different.  Went back to ads and Android.,Negative
486,"Overall i would be inclined to give this item a higher rating as the phone itself was in great condition, however upon arrival the phones microphone did not work at all...a message was sent to seller with no response at all, only an approval for a refund...item was returned immediately and waiting on refund...I would have just asked for an exchange (less hassle) however due to sellers silence I will just get a refund and shop somewhere else I guess...",Positive

490,It has some issue with volume and when I put the speaker mode in a call the sound quality is bad . It shows signs that it was opened and screwed back in at the bottom of the phone where the speakers are. I ended up buying headphones to be able to use it. I put volume on maximum to have a disent sound. I understand that it is a renewed model but for the price i paid i was expecting a much better quality . Battery life is very good,Positive
491,"i assumed the phone was gonna be crappy because i didn‚Äôt fully trust the fact it i was being ordered from amazon but i stand corrected. the phone came perfect no scratches nor defects, battery last awhile, and the face recognition works how it would on any other phone. the phone isn‚Äôt slow or hard to use, it really is amazing! if you‚Äôre thinking about buying from this seller please do so :D",Positive

Not enjoyable at all.",Positive

At the end of the day the battery is usually at 45-50%. There isn‚Äôt even any scratches or marks that I can notice.

I'll check later how the phone works.,Positive
504,"Phone arrived in great shape, battery seems to hold a charge very well. I did have a problem with the supplied aftermarket charging cable, as the phone would give the ‚Äúaccessory not supported‚Äù notification. When I swapped to another charge cable the problem stopped and the battery was able to fully charge. Although mine did not arrive in the original packaging, it was well packed in bubble wrap with a glass screen protector installed. Overall, I am satisfied with the phone, although don‚Äôt count on the accessories.",Positive

507,"Was super excited to receive product, however‚Ä¶ the screen was super scratched. Phone was sooo dirty and had a lot of scuff marks on it.

2138,"I bought mine from Metro, so my only choices were black or red, went with black though it sits in a case anyway. Stuck with 64GB, but I don't use too many apps nor plan to keep photos/videos stored on it.As someone who has been on Android since the start of smartphones, this is THE time where jumping to iOS is going to be the most smooth, and you'll enjoy a few extra features. This won't happen until iOS 14, but once it's released, it will make this phone a great choice even for users used to Android.The phone, like many other phones, is a little too smooth for holding, which makes pressing buttons by accident a thing, so slap on a case not only to protect it, but to make handling better. One upcoming feature in iOS 14 is the ability to tap the back of the phone for your chosen options, so it's yet to be known if protective cases will get in the way of that functionality. I don't use headphones much, but it is still annoying knowing these phones no longer have an analogue 3.5mm audio jack. The packaging is top notch tho, and I've been using the screen protector it shipped with, even though I don't think it's meant to stay on the phone lol, but if it gets bubbles or just gets too damaged, I'll just replace it. It still ships with a ton of apps you may or may not use. I don't use a few of them and a couple cannot be deleted. iOS 14 will allow us to hide them tho, so this will soon be a thing of the past. Getting used to navigating the system doesn't take too long, even to an Android user. Eventually things just flow.I picked this phone because it's as good as the 11 pro/pro max, but without the telephoto lens, and still bigger than the 11 pro. I felt it was a reasonable compromise since I will rarely need the optical zoom capabilities of the pro max. The wide lens is something I will use far more since it comes in handy when you want to take pictures of a room and sometimes you simply have no space to move far back enough. That's the rear cameras, but the front camera can also do .5 wide, which is good for vloggers/irl streamers, especially if you ever need to include another person in the shot.Setup is ez pz and now you can import your stuff not only if you are upgrading from another iPhone, but you can also import stuff from Android, you only need to download an app to the Android phone for it to work.I haven't used all the features of the phone yet, but it looks like it's going to be a good experience, at least until Apple decides to slow it down to coerce me to upgrade lol.",Neutral
2139,"I have been using a hand me down Iphone 6s plus for years. It was a phone my sister no longer needed to I upgraded from the iphone 4. I haven't felt the need to upgrade since newer iphones basically do the same thing except for the facial thing blah blah. I don't need all that and I actually prefer a phone that has the wired jack plug. Why in the world did Apple ever do away with that?!Anyways, I realized I needed a new phone with the Iphone 6s plus started taking really crappy photos and was just slower overall even after I changed out the battery. So I started looking for newer phones and a friend recommended Amazon and that a renewed phone wasn't a bad way to go. The Iphone 11 purple 128 gb was a great deal considering brand new phones go for well over 1100-1300. I had some issues setting up the new iphone (my fault with forgetting my encryption passcode) but I was finally able to get the new iphone updated, transferred over my data, inserted the Sim card, and it works great with Mint Mobile. No issues so far with Mint that I have seen yet. The back and front did have a few slight smudges however it was nothing a tempered glass screen couldn't cover up and honestly I don't notice them at all when I am using the phone. It is in great condition but the battery is at 85% so I'm thinking in the next 6 months to 1 year I will need to replace the battery.Overall, this has been a great experience. I love the new phone and will update my review in 90 days.",Positive
2140,"This iPhone is a really good phone, probably one of the best phones (at the time). It has a few problems but it is a solid iPhone.Camera: This phone takes really good pictures. It has live photos you can blur out your backgrounds and even up the camera to 4k. It has a nighttime mode where you can change your picture to look like it was taken during the day. It is a cool thing but the zoom in the future is not that good, it comes out blurry.Battery; The battery life on the phone was amazing after about 1 week of having it die faster. When you are using specific apps it dies quickly. You can go from 100 to 70 in just 10 mins. Also, it tends to burn up when you are using apps.Price: The iPhone 11 stands at about $409 and $521 Canadian. Before the price was a lot higher but with a price like this it is a must-get for anyone looking for a decent Phone.I compared the iPhone 11 to the iPhone 10. The build is the same, it looks the same other than the camera. The iPhone X takes a point for battery life. The iPhone 11 dies faster than the iPhone X. the iPhone 11 has a much better camera than the X because it has 1.71x more megapixels which make the camera a lot better. And if you are a person that likes to play games the iPhone 11 has a higher resolution, a fast download time and the CPU is great. So the iPhone 11 is Better than the iPhone X.The iPhone 11 is the same as the XR. It has one less camera than Apple's more-premium models, and its screen isn't nearly as nice. There are advantages to the Pros, but after getting a for what the iPhone 11 is capable of, spending the extra $300 is not a bad thing, it is really good and worth it.",Positive
2141,"The phone had so many dents not even scratcheS DENTS!!!! I paid$587.00, which is $12.00 less than apple sellig it for $599, I had no idea it was so cheap on apple, else I would have bought it from there. I am so disappointed with how bad the phone looks on the outside. So far software is good but other than that it looks like an old phone.  I would be happy paying $250.00 for a phone that looks like this not almost $600.00",Positive
2142,"I purchased two iPhone 11s (New). I have always been an Android user. I purchased the iPhone for its enhanced security. Here are the issues: The glass screen often does not respond so I find myself pressing an arrow or icon several times to get it to work. Whenever I use the phone for a WiFi hotspot, it will disconnect from whatever device I am connecting to after a few minutes. Also, the iPhone is not as user-friendly as an Android. If I could return my iPhones I would do it in a minute.",Positive
2143,I am FURIOUS!! I bought this and NO WAY TO CHARGE IT!! They don't bother adding in of plug so that you can actually charge the phone! Their excuse to save on admissions? Really? Now I have to go and order one before I can use my phone that I just spent $600 on! They don't even provide you a way to plug it in and charge it! It's all a scam so that you are forced to spend more money to charge it once you get it! And I think that sucks it's a scam to rip off their customers if you want to buy a phone don't buy one that doesn't come with a plug. SCAM!,Negative

It IS unlocked and came with a screen protector and sim card remover :) everything is nice and like new. I can‚Äôt say this is guaranteed to be for everyone but if you need something not super pricey this is the best seller, be aware not every phone can be perfect but if you want this buy it with some thought.",Positive
2148,"Tried installing the SIM card from my old Android phone, kept saying I had no service even though the SIM card was a known good and the area I was in was known to have service.

Quisiera comprar m√°s pero este vendedor ya no tiene m√°s disponibles.",Positive
2202,"I Love it! At first, I was very skeptical and prepared myself to send it back expecting to be disappointed. When I got the package the box said it was sanitized and the smell co-signed that 100%. The phone had no scratches on the body and was virtually perfect, only scratch found was a somewhat length scuff on the vertical half portion of the upper screen which seems to be fixable if some sort of adhesive was applied. With a screen protector, the scratch isn't even noticeable and the battery health was 100%. Got a 256GB for the price of the 128, I'm satisfied for now. I'll report any defects in the future but so far I definitely recommend this.",Positive
2203,"In the 10 years that I‚Äôve owned smartphones I have always had androids. I had a galaxy S9 but I accidentally cracked the screen, so I decided to get the S10 on a whim. I immediately hated it. I‚Äôve been just tolerating it for 9 months, and was prepared to just tolerate it for the full 2 years. But then I found this deal on a refurb iPhone 11!Like everyone else I was a little skeptical over it being a refurb but it came in excellent condition! The only cosmetic damage is a very small scratch on the screen which is invisible unless you‚Äôre really inspecting the screen.The battery life on this phone so far has been pretty amazing. I use my phone a lot at home and especially for work, the battery lasted almost 2 full days???? Not sure if that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs so new but either way I‚Äôm happy.Having never owned an iPhone before I was nervous that I would absolutely hate the ui but I got used to it pretty quickly! I actually really really like this phone! The display is a much better resolution than the S10 even though the screen size is exactly the same. The audio seems to be much clearer as well.I also really love the unique color! The pictures of it really don‚Äôt do it justice. In the listing it looks like a light grayish lavender but in person it‚Äôs more saturated. I‚Äôve only had it for 4 days and it‚Äôs already gotten lots of compliments!Overall I really really like this phone so far and I really have no complaints. I probably won‚Äôt be going back to Android :)",Positive
2204,I order this and found out my batter percentage was 86%. I thought they tested for faults and repaired them. Overall the phone is good and in very good condition. But if you are buying this as renewed from amazon make sure to check the price in apple's website bcuz apple is selling it for more $50 for a new one and if you have a old iphone like 6s which i did you could get it by replace for less than $560.,Positive
2205,"So I ordered 3 of these refurbished phones in total. The first phone, the screen shattered the first time it fell 2 feet to the floor which indicates the screen must have been replaced with one of the cheap ones. I returned it and ordered a second one. This time they sent the wrong color and the screen was visibly scratched pretty badly. I didn't even bother turning it on and just sent it back right away. The 3rd one I got had a big purple patch on the LCD screen like something heavy had fell on it. I sent that one back too. I went to the Apple website and you can get Apple Certified Refurbished phones for the exact same price as the ones here! but they're actually inspected and verified by Apple. SO I ended up doing that instead. If I could do it all over again I'd do that from the beginning and save myself the headache. It's a roll of the dice with these phones.",Positive
2206,"I can‚Äôt believe how great of a deal that I‚Äôve gotten with this phone. I know it says refurbished, but I don‚Äôt see any blemishes or anything wrong with it. It has a lot to do with the Company that I‚Äôve dealt with,The companies name is (buy spry) and they were great in sending me an excellent phone and in great condition. I would highly recommend this company if you‚Äôre looking for a less expensive phone but just as good as all the other ones that are out there. I‚Äôm very satisfied with this purchase from this company. I bought this iPhone 11 with my own money, nobody‚Äôs paying me to write this review. Again I would recommend this phone just Because the company stand‚Äôs by their word and will send you a great phone at a reasonable price.One last comment about this phone I included a photo of the battery life, it‚Äôs 95%. That‚Äôs great in my book.",Positive
2207,"I purchased the yellow iPhone 11 64gb unlocked and overall it is a pretty great phone. Even though the reviews were iffy, I still decided to take that chance. Once I got the phone it came with a screen protector which was a pretty good bonus. It also came with a charger and adapter (not from apple but works just as good). I did notice a few things that were definitely wrong. My ringer button does not work at all. It is a very tiny green dot in the left corner which isn‚Äôt noticeable at all and it honestly took me a few days to even notice it. It did disappoint me that I‚Äôm not able to purchase apple care for this phone but that is ok because my phone company offers a better deal (T-Mobile). I am coming from a iPhone 6s so this is a huge upgrade and it was definitely worth it so overall it is a pretty good deal for the price so if you‚Äôre thinking about making that purchase then go right ahead.",Positive
2208,"I‚Äôm so thankful Amazon offers the phone refurbished. I‚Äôm not spending $150 a month with leases and payments to these phone companies. With a family of seven and kids that want to keep up with the Joneses. Verizon offers a prepaid plan unlimited everything for $35. That‚Äôs right for $35 a month draft it out of your debit card or go in the store and pay. If you have your own phone you get the same service as I paid $150 a month for for $35. I cannot do that if Amazon did not offer these refurbished phones. Thanks to Amazon and thanks to whoever is refurbishing these phones. Please take my advice,Switch to prepaid and buy yourself a pair of shoes every month with the savings",Positive
2209,"the phone worked well, but the face recognition did not work. I tried everything, but nothing and I had to send my phone to amazon to get my money back and I was left without phone for a couple of days.",Neutral
2210,"I have always used an android phone. I find that the assumption that people should automatically know how to use an iphone is ignorant.

They don't live nearby, so they can't show me how to use them.  A little help goes a long way. I also find that the phone doesn't hold a charge for a decent amount of time.",Positive
2211,"So far I‚Äôm very pleased with the iPhone 11 I received. I purchased an AT&T locked phone because it was cheaper and I‚Äôve had so many bad experiencing buying ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù phones in the past that aren‚Äôt unlocked.Anyway, I‚Äôm upgrading from an old iPhone 6s so by comparison everything seems super sleek and nice. My refurbished phone came to me undamaged and I did not find any nicks or scratches on it, it essentially looks brand new. Battery life seems amazing. The seller even put a screen protector on it, which was a super nice touch and I was not expecting it.",Positive
2212,I love this phone. I‚Äôve had it for a couple of months and it‚Äôs like brand  news. Good buy,Positive
2213,"iPhone 11 came in basically brand new and WITH a screen protector. Only thing is don‚Äôt expect a Apple IPhone box, it comes with a after market charger and little cardboard box where the phone came in. Other than that the phone is working perfect !!! I am very satisfied!",Positive
2214,"SO FAR SO GOOD! THE IPHONE LOOKS BRAND NEW, NO SCRATCHES OR ANYTHING. SETUP WAS SUPER SIMPLE, JUST POPPED IN MY CRICKET SIM CARD AND I WAS ROCKING! I WAS NERVOUS ABOUT GETTING THIS BUT SO HAPPY I DID. I WILL UPDATE MY REVIEW AFTER SOME TIME , IT'S ONLY BEEN ONE DAY BUT IM VERY VERY PLEASED. WOULD DEFN RECOMMEND.",Positive
2215,"Making this review on my purple iPhone 11 üíú it‚Äôs the best iPhone I‚Äôve used so far! It‚Äôs super cute and I recommend buying it renewed here and saving money. It has 100% battery health and this phone looks brand new no cracks or scratches at all. It has a great camera and it‚Äôs a better choice over the 11 pro series. It has been working well for me so far, and the battery lasts the entire day!!",Positive
2216,Didn‚Äôt come in original box .... came bubble wrapped in a usps box with a charger and block ...HOWEVER ... it said this in description so I want surprised just want to state this.Phone was connected and downloaded from cloud all our old phone ... flawless process and so far so good!!! We did insure it would assurion add on ... overall great product!,Positive
2217,"The phone is like new. the only little blemish is on the protective screen, which I could replace. the battery is at 90-percent, the phone was shipped with a cable and wall charger, plus a SIM remover thingy. The only issue is that it does not connect to my Mac probably because I would need an original Apple cable.",Positive
2218,"GUYS THIS IS A MUST BUY GREAT PRICE AND BATTERY LIFE CAME IN 100% AND IT CAME WITH A TEMPERED GLASS,ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE MONEY",Positive
2219,"La verdad tenia miedo de comprarlo x amazon ya que no vivo en USA, pero la verdad vale la pena! buen√≠simo, lo he exprimido al m√°ximo ( lo he usado continuamente en google meet, clases, etc.) y otras actividades que requieren bastante energ√≠a de un celular en todos los sentidos, y tanto en la bater√≠a c√≥mo en las funciones funciona a la perfecci√≥n! Tiene garant√≠a x 90 d√≠as en caso de que algo le pase, lo puede devolver! ENCANTADA, LO RECOMIENDO 100%",Neutral
2220,I love my new Phone. It feel so good to upgrade from a iPhone 6s to a iPhone 11.,Positive
2221,Checks all of the boxes. We all know what we‚Äôre getting into buying a renewed phone but I was very surprised with this one. Battery is at 100% even comes with a tempered glass installed perfectly. There was only one small little scratch but it‚Äôs very unnoticeable and the case hides it anyway. I was apprehensive but I‚Äôm very happy with what I got. Plus with Apple no longer giving charging bricks out the box might as well buy this.,Positive
2222,"Had it for about 3 weeks so far and i love it. It works just as i had hoped and was indeed fully unlocked...there were no scratches or dents. Just FYI, It comes comes in a generic box with a generic lighting cable charger and some manuals. All in all its a legit iPhone!",Positive
2223,"It came in a really obscure android box which got me sweating a little bit but when I opened it, I was more than happy. It looked brand new. It came with a screen protector already on it and with the charging adapter and chord. The setup was good, and I‚Äôve been using it for 2 months. The only thing I can say that was a little annoying was that it took forever to charge and the charger adapter stopped working which is an easy fix. You can always buy a new adapter if you really so choose which is what I did and I‚Äôve been happy ever since. So if you‚Äôre going to buy this and need confirmation it‚Äôs worth it, this is it.",Positive
2224,Ordered a refurbished Iphone 11.  It came in excellent condition.  Not a scratch on it.  It's like new.  Everything works great.  The seller provided a top quality phone.  I'm very pleased and it came in 2 days.,Positive
2225,"I got the phone as a gift for my cousin who loves it. Out of the box she was able to get it to work with Metro PCS without issues. Talk, text, internet, she has had no issues. The battery lasts over 3 days without having to recharge (she is a lighter user.) Amazing value for an amazing unit.",Positive
2226,"I‚Äôve had the phone for a month now and when I got it came in a white box, with no original charger box just a white cable and black generic box. After the plastic was remove the phone showed very little to no damage at all, very small scratches around the corners of the screen from past use but you can barely notice it with a screen protector and a phone case on it. The battery life was 87% when I got it but now it has gone up to 91%, but the battery is amazing and lasts all day. It is fast and reliable. Value for your money, yes. Fave recognition also is fast, the camera is great too, overall great buy",Positive
2227,"The camera comes with three microphones (selfie camera, front camera, and phone talk camera) and the microphone for regular cell phone calls , located  next to the power input, had scratchy noise and people could barely hear me even since I received it. I did not have a phone  protection cover. I had to call Apple and after troubleshooting, they wanted $400 to repair. So I returned to the seller as it is obvious that they had not done their quality check.The only good thing is that I received my money refund fast, within 4 days of shipping the return.",Positive

But I have many data stored in this phone which I cannot just give them up and live without a working phone for a week. I repair it on my own packet and they refused to give any reimbursement or makeup. Disappointed, the screen change cost 130 dollar.",Positive
2230,"Looked like a brand new phone, no marks, smudges or scratches to be found.  Came with aftermarket USB charger and lightening cable.  Was cleared to be freshly set up.  I verified IMEI with Apple.  And had no problem porting my phone number to it from ATT to T-mobile.",Positive
2231,"Whenever I first purchase this phone it was because my dogs decided to chew up my iPhone X I had for 3 years. Everywhere I looked the iPhone 11 was $800-$1,000. I was very skeptical about buying a used iPhone off of amazon and whenever i unpackaged the phone the ""Smart Phone"" box it came in was all bent and opened at the top but surprisingly and thankfully the iPhone was perfectly fine, came with a full battery, no cracks or dinged places. And the transfer over with just my old sim card was so easy and hassle free. I am in love with my new phone, definitely with all my money!!",Positive
2232,"I was apprehensive about purchasing a telephone online as I‚Äôm more of a tangible person. With that being said I did, however, order a refurbished phone from Amazon. This turned out to be one of the best purchases I‚Äôve ever made. The phone arrived with not a scratch on it; looks brand new.  After putting in my original Sim card from my 2013 phone, everything just started rolling and no problems were encountered. Highly recommend purchasing this phone!",Positive

2236,"I really like the phone as a whole.  Charge holds pretty well, maybe just get some good charger depending on the charger it can take a little while to charge compared to my last phone.  Service is great with metro pcs. The camera is FANTASTIC! Serious quality! This is my favorite iPhone yet!",Positive
2237,En muy buena condici√≥n,Neutral
2238,"I rarely buy brand new Apple. I have always bought refurbished iPhones and they‚Äôve all been great. This one from Amazon is no exception. It came in a generic box with a generic charger but the phone itself is great. Everything works well, looks beautiful. No scratches on the screen but a few on the back (as stated in the quality assurance). Cameras are great and so is every other feature. If you‚Äôre looking to buy a great refurbed iPhone for a good cost, this company does great!",Positive
2239,I am very un pleased with my purchase . I received the phone locked ! I‚Äôve spent too much time on the phone with my carrier trying to transfer my number onto this phone .

My options were return the phone or try taking it to ATT store. Communication with the seller was outstanding! I initially did it via Amazon chat and then I asked for a phone number. When I called I got a voicemail and though hmm they are not going to call back. But they did, the person who I spoke with was fantastic. ATT was able to transfer my service without a problem.The morale of the story is don‚Äôt give up if it doesn‚Äôt work the 1st time.

I was scared since I have not had good experiences buying electronics second hand before. Despite the crushed box, the phone was safe with protective wrapping, and the distributor even added a screen protector for me ! I bought some glass protectors to add but now I don‚Äôt have to immediately open that package because the seller has kindly given me one. The charger and plug work good, I use my old Apple charger and have the one that came with this phone saved for travel. It has been a month since I‚Äôve had this phone, and the condition is great. the camera quality is much better than my old 7 plus, and the battery life is also MUCH better. The color is very beautiful as well! I do sometimes find my phone glitching, but that may be because I run many applications at once and overwork the phone.

2525,"The product allows you to do and create so many things such as; Texting, calling, using social media, you can even create art and edit photos that you‚Äôve taken with its Dual 12MP Wide and Ultra Wide cameras and so much more. This product is The iphone 11, created by Apple. Apple also makes other electronics such as tablets, bluetooth earphones, smart watches, computers, streaming devices and even accessories to go with these devices. I have had this product for about two years now, and it's still working perfectly fine. This product looks like the iPhone XR but with two caramers.  It‚Äôs all red, with the word ‚Äú(Product) RED‚Äù on it. It is 128GB with a 6.1 inch screen size. This is one of the best iPhones Apple has created.You might ask how this product works, and how could you use it? The product is a phone so you can call out on it. You can FaceTime other iPhone users, you can also browse through the web, you can take pictures one, and you can text people. This product is very easy to use and if you don‚Äôt know how to use it they come with a ‚ÄúHOW TO‚Äù so you can get a good understanding of your phone. I have used this product to the max. I have done everything with this phone. For example, I have played games on it, called people, and texted them. I have also sent emails, plus I have done my school work with it.What are some pros and cons of this iPhone? Well some pros would have to be how good the phone looks. This iPhone was  one of the first phones to have two camera. This phone has one of the faster smartphone chips in it. Which means the phone moves faster and loads up thighs a lot faster. Some more pros are that it has very good video, and screen quality. The iPhone also comes in more new colors then any other phone.The cons are lower than you think. One of them is that it didn‚Äôt come with the new fast charger unlike the 11 pro max and up. This phone didn‚Äôt come with an ultra wide lens, which means that any phone that‚Äôs newer than this phone has a better camera. Some more are that it didn‚Äôt have any updates to the screen, so it‚Äôs still the same as the iPhone XR. And, lastly the phone only comes with 64 to 256GB, so there's less storage on the phone.In conclusion you see that this is a great phone to purchase. The two years of experience I have is letting you know what I‚Äôm talking about. The pros and cons help you understand the phone some more, and it could help you towards your final purchase.",Positive

2539,"It‚Äôs a great phone, but after dealing with my first one I bought on Amazon I‚Äôm still disappointed. I buy refurbished because it‚Äôs cheaper and better for the environment than buying brand new. With that said, I am struggling with the feeling now that I should have bought new! My first try on the iPhone 11 left me with a horrible battery and a scratchy screen. This one I hoped at least would have a 95% capacity for the battery. Instead it‚Äôs at 86%, so in the near future I‚Äôll probably have to get a new battery for it. I‚Äôm starting to question whether it was worth it or not.

2550,I usually don‚Äôt write reviews but I wanted to write the review on this purchase because this phone is like brand-new and I love it. I read the reviews before I purchased it and was a little worried because some said the battery life was not long and it was scratched but I received mine in perfect condition and the battery is 100% and it was a great buy,Neutral
2551,I received my new (refurbished) iphone 11 last week and LOVE it!  It arrived earlier than expected- boxed and looking like it was brand new.  No scratches or wear at all.  Transferring everything from my old phone was very easy.  I'm extremely happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend. I also like that Amazon offers a 90 day return policy in case there are any problems.,Positive

2556,"So far so good. I bought this for my 16 year old son and it arrived within a week. It's a very nice phone. It came in really good shape couldn't tell it was renewed other than the damaged box and the charger it came with didn't charge it more than a couple percent in the 30 minutes it was plugged in. It arrived with a completely empty battery which was a bummer but my son charged it to 56 percent, did an update, uploaded his apps, and transferred all his data and after 2 hours the battery was only down 4 percent. He was really happy with it. And he said the camera was great. Him and his brother were having so much fun playing with the features. This is the second renewed apple product I've purchased and I recommend buying Amazon renewed to a lot of my friends. The great customer service and 90 day guarantee are really comforting. The phone had no signs of wear at all.",Positive

2564,Phone came with a screen protector and in decent condition. Only scratches were paint around the camera. But pretty much brand new looking! Ordering another for family!,Positive
2565,"The phone was purchased to replace a newer phone with a severely damaged screen.  Simply moving the sim card from the previous phone was all it took to start working, all data transferred quickly without issue.  Cameras and all functions including face recognition work fine, battery life good although it has dropped slightly over time.  Meets our needs at a far lower price than a new phone!",Positive

2586,"The phone came in really good condition, battery levels within the information from the description. I really think it was a good deal. Phone has great working condition.  Realized the phone was not unlocked for the needed carrier and because of that I contacted the seller. They attempted to assist and as it was not possible to fix it remotelly, they offered to replace or refund product right away and already provided the shipping details. It was a smooth communication and simple to deal with them.",Positive
2587,"Hola! Para los que estan pensando en comprar este producto, lo recomiendo bastante, la pantalla frontal y el vidrio de atr√°s intactos, viene con un vidrio protector cual tambi√©n evita que se vean los defectos que pueda traer pero igual es algo que le tienes que poner que evitar que se rompa con las ca√≠das, la bater√≠a me vino con 100% de capacidad y el FaceID funciona sin problemas, cu√°les eran mis mayores preocupaciones, de la est√©tica yo le doy 9.5/10, tiene tres peque√±os rayones como de ca√≠da en la parte de abajo, para mi no son problema y no se notan mucho sobre todo por que es negro, igual la funda que le compre los cubren, estoy muy contenta con el producto, relaci√≥n calidad precio bastante buena, te ahorras bastante a comparaci√≥n del precio en tienda o a mesesViene en un empaque/caja peque√±o protegido de bolsas de aire que amortiguan, para mi debi√≥ estar m√°s protegido porque las paqueter√≠as suelen aventar los paquetes, pero llego bien",Neutral
2588,"Al principio ten√≠a muchas dudas sobre comprar este tel√©fono o no. Vi algunas cr√≠ticas malas hacia √©ste y me pon√≠an en duda. Sin embargo, lo compre y al siguiente d√≠a ya me lo hab√≠an entregado. Entre lo primero que quise ver fue la bater√≠a ya que muchos mencionaban que ven√≠a de 80 a 90 de capacidad y el tel√©fono que me lleg√≥ la trae del 100%.En cuanto a la est√©tica le doy un 8/10, ya que tiene algunos detalles en la parte superior e inferior pero nada que me moleste (al menos a m√≠) y en la parte de atr√°s se ven apenas unos rayones, nada de qu√© preocuparse.Quedo satisfecho con la compra. Lo estar√© probando por varios meses y si detect√≥ algo raro lo publicar√©.Pd. El face ID jala bien, la c√°mara igual y en las pocas horas que llevo de uso no se me ha trabado.Actualizaci√≥n: llevo dos semanas de uso y el tel√©fono se ha comportado a la perfecci√≥n. La bater√≠a me dura un d√≠a y medio con uso moderado (s√≥lo uso redes sociales y de vez en cuando veo alg√∫n video). Tambi√©n en cuanto a la carga creo que est√° bien. Lo pongo a cargar cuando est√° entre 15% y 20% y normalmente se carga en hora y media.Seguir√© reportando camaradas!De momento recomiendo ampliamente a este vendendor ya que igual compr√© un iPhone X y tampoco ha tenido fallas e incluso lleg√≥ con est√©tica de 10 y bater√≠a al 100%",Positive
2589,"Estoy muy decepcionado con esta compra ya que el tel√©fono est√° muy maltratado y con unos rayones bastante visibles y sucio tambi√©n. Para la calidad el precio es elevado, el modelo tambi√©n es el que se vende en USA por lo que no es compatible con algunas compa√±√≠as en Mexico. Ya lo regrese. Espero mi reembolso pronto.",Neutral
2590,"If you're purchasing this from outside the U.S, the ""final price"" at purchase isn't the final price because the taxes and shipping fee hasn't been applied yet (it will do so once shipped, and then you'll see the charges in your bank account). This is not the company's fault, and it is something Amazon should make clear to their customers. At first I was upset at the seller due to my misunderstanding, but after communicating with them, they did their best to make sure I wasn't dissatisfied with the transaction. Before leaving a negative review, message the seller and I'm sure they'll try to help you out, especially if you're unsure about some of the details in their advertisement.The seller delivers on promise on what the phone comes with (although a nitpick, the battery was not near 80 percent). The screen has a noticeable scratch, which was to be expected. The delivery was quick and came next day. Mine came with freebies such as a screen protector and phone case. This product is worth the money, in my opinion.",Positive
2591,"Al comprar un reacondicionado esperaba aunque fuera una m√≠nima marca de uso y ahora que recojo el tel√©fono me llev√© una sorpresa: est√° NUEVO. No tiene una sola marca de uso, literal nada. La bater√≠a viene al 100% de la salud. La herramienta U3 le da un score de 100 ya que no tiene NI UNA SOLA PIEZA CAMBIADA. De hecho, indica que s√≥lo se ha cargado en 9 ocasiones (de las cuales 2 son m√≠as). El vendedor fue BuySPRY, por lo que busqu√©, es una empresa que se dedica a los renewed, recomendar√≠a que hicieran la compra con el mismo.El cargador, tal como lo indica la publicaci√≥n, no es el original pero s√≠ est√° certificado.Feliz porque me ahorr√© $4,500 y al final termin√© recibiendo un tel√©fono nuevo s√≥lo que con otra caja.",Positive
2592,"Al ser un producto reparado o reacondicionado, tiene uno que otro defecto. En mi caso no hay detalles a menos que se revise a consciencia. El dispositivo funciona muy bien. No se si todos los dispositivos que env√≠an tengan protecci√≥n de pantalla. Le da un poco de plus ese detalle. Aunque  a la luz del sol opaca la pantalla. Otra cosa que debes tener en cuenta. Es que viene sin accesorios. De antemano debes comprar al menos un cable de datos y un cargador. Un detalle a considerar en mi caso es que se pierde la conexi√≥n con la computadora. Aun no se si es problema de hardware o software.",Neutral

I bought one here 3 years ago and it arrived in an IPhone box and had protective coating on the phone like new. It was a great experience and great phone.

Mi inconformidad es que en la descripci√≥n del equipo deber√≠a aclarar que la pantalla pudiera estar rayada y que el protector de cristal no debe ser retirado para que no se vean y sientan los rayones as√≠ mismo el precio deber√≠a ser mucho menor. En resumen si compran estos equipos usados exijan que NO tengan micas colocadas para que puedan comprobar el verdadero estado del tel√©fono.

El cargador tiene el Certificado y funciona bastante bien, aunque opte por comprar su cargador original. En Conclusion, se los recomiendo bastante por el precio que pagas, y con amazon tienes la garantia de 90 dias ante cualquier falla o no estar satisfecho! llevo 2 semanas de uso aproximadamente y hasta ahora todo correcto, lo volveria comprar sin problemas o por lo menos tomare en cuenta esta opcion cuando quiera cambiar de celular!

Todos los botones sirven, el FaceID sirve y la pantalla viene intacta.
