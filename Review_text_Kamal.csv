0,Purchased this product advertised as fully unlocked. Inserted my sim card and it did not work. Contacted my service provider and they checked my IMEI number and it reported that the phone was still locked by the original carrier. Phone came in good condition just couldn't use any service provider.
1,I was feeling a bit skeptical after I placed my order but I was proven wrong! The phone looks brand new besides some very minimal/ light scratches (almost impossible to notice) and the battery life is still at 100%. I also like that there was a screen protector on the phone
2,Phone was not unlocked could it use it
3,The screen came cracked and popped out of the frame. Hopefully the return process goes smoothly.
4,"This is the best experience I have ever had with buying a renewed phone. The phone came in it’s original box with original charger and cable and the phone looks excellent, not one scratch on it absolutely beautiful and the battery health was at 100%. I definitely recommend the seller GoOverstock, as I will definitely be buying from them again."
5,Be careful mine had a scratch on screen very small but still 😢 their Used. People dont want used I phones with scratches
6,"I fought it for the longest time but I finally gave in and upgraded to the iPhone 11 from the iPhone 7. I looked other places online, but the price was way out of my price point. I felt comfortable buying this phone from Amazon because it was certified refurbished and I’m still happy that I did."
7,The box didn’t come with ear phones. The phone kept turning off by itself after set up. Some apps had to be deleted before they’d quit shutting off on their own.
8,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I just wanna tell everybody this is NOT A SCAM!!!! This phone is so amazing, great battery life, Face ID everything. Unfortunately mine didn’t come in an iPhone box but I was too much worried about that but it did come w/ a charger . Please get this phone  don’t let any of these reviews scare you! I will be doing a month review on this phone for more updates. Brand new and unlocked I’m paired with cricket so everything transferred over so easily!"
9,"My iPhone came with a big scuff on the corner (aluminum frame)  and a small (not really noticible) scratch on the front and back of the phone. I got the 64 gb product red unlocked iPhone 11 which was, I believe a Verizon unlocked phone. My phone came in the iPhone 11 apple box with a original apple charger and original apple brick.  When I set up my phone I just put in my T-Mobile sim and the phone started working with my data. I did not need to get it activated or anything."
10,"Working well so far, looks new."
11,"My phone re start over and over again, that's so sad because the i phone looks like new😶"
12,"I received my phone a day early and it came exactly as I imagined. I was a little nervous buying a refurbished phone on the internet, but I truly have no complaints. The phone came in perfect, like new condition and has been working great with my carrier and in general.Came with a charger and charging block as mentioned in the description. It also came with a screen protector that was already put on the screen! That was an awesome and much appreciated touch. There’s also 60 day warranty and free returns just in case something were to happen.I’m incredibly pleased. Would definitely recommend to anyone!"
13,"Amazon renewed phone. Was expecting minor cosmetic issue as described, however there was a decent size mark above the volume down button and the volume down button does not function properly. Contacted amazon and the seller and have not gotten this resolved."
14,"been using iphones for a a long time. i needed a new one & saw this online for a good price. i dont have any complaints it works great. camera quality is amazing. it came with a charger, but *did not come with headphones* and it did not come in the classic “iPhone” packaging which didnt bug me but other people might care. i definitely recommend but if you want the headphones id buy them separately."
15,"Very disappointed with this purchase: Was same price as a brand new Apple I-Phone. This phone had 2 deep scratches on screen, did not come with earphones, was not an Apple charging cord, (although it had a sticker saying it was), was not an Apple charger. Also was never able to install I cloud."

   I purchased this iPhone 11 because it said it was unlocked. I have always owned unlocked iphones and never had troubles with them. I live in Guatemala. This iPhone 11 was working for a few days but all of the sudden ""stopped"" recognizing my SIM card. As you can see in the video the issue is not my SIM card because it works in my old and unlocked iPhone 8. Since I am not in the USA I lost almost $600. Beware, don't buy this product. It is a complete scam."
17,"This is not a scam!! I repeat this is not a scam! I love iPhones, I always want a nice good working phone that I know won’t take a dump in me because me being a single mom I need to beable to keep in touch with school and grandpa so if anything happens I’m aware right away! I love this phone! No scratches no dings! It’s like brand new!!! It looks new! And works like new!!! Comes with a screen protector! I am in love!!! The battery capacity is 100%! And it’s a killer deal for the price of this kind of phone!! It’s well worth it and it came in two days with my Amazon prime earlier than it said it would! You will be happy! I highly recommend!"
18,Don’t trust the refurbished phone from Tech Exchange!! The ear speaker on this phone does not work. I can turn the phone on speaker phone and make a phone call but when you try and take it off speakerphone all you hear is garbled voices and a lot of static. You can understand about every 10th word.  Then today when trying to make a phone call with the speakerphone every time I pushed one of the numbers to dial in the number from the pack and made a really loud high-pitched tone. When  I hit the side button to try and shut the sound off the screen went black and it still was making this weird high-pitched sound that ended up stopping after about 30-45 seconds very annoying. I finally had to shut the phone completely off and turn it back on at which point I was able to make a call on speakerphone. I’ve never had problems like this with a refurbished phone! After doing a chat with Amazon they told me I had to handle it with the seller who is supposed to be calling me to provide me with a prepaid label to return it and to discuss a replacement phone. The return policy says I have to return the phone to them and then they have two weeks to give me a refund on my money so that it will be another two weeks before a order a different phone.I just want to say that after I finally received a call from them my refund was processed very promptly.
19,I haven’t had the phone for 2 weeks and now the power button isn’t working and now the seller isn’t responding !!!
20,"IPhone was shipped in two-day delivery. The box inside of a FedEx bag came opened but the FedEx bag itself was untouched, so I presume it was not completely closed before sealing the bag. The phone came with no scratch or sign of usage at all, a screen protector (nice touch) and generic certified usb cable and charger. No earphones as described. Battery life is 100%. So far it looks and works good. Im only a little concerned that it gets quite hot in the back.Im only doing the math and believe $639.99 is still a high price for a refurbished. If you want replace the generic stuff by purchasing an original charger + cable + earpods + connector, the total price will go beyond a brand new phone."
21,"""Fully unlocked and compatible with any carrier of choice"" is is a false statement in their add for Amazon. When I received the phone there was a paper inside the box saying not compatible with Sprint or Boost Mobile. I happen to use one of those carriers, and rather then erasing all my info that I already had transferred from my old phone to the new phone and mailing the phone back I chose to switch carriers which was an additional pain. So BuySPRY won in the end but I will never purchase from them again."
22,Great product. Looks and works exactly like new
23,"Every things right,  battery came with %100 capacity,  and it arrived 4 days early through FedEx,  i got the color and device storage I ordered.  Theres a few scratches on the bare screen which prove its used,  (i peeled the screen protector it came with off so i could put my tempered glass one on) but theyre invisible when a screen protector is on.  Phone is lighting fast and im just so happy!I had some doubts when buying this phone because there weren't enough reviews on it and it was used.  But its entirely like new,  although you dont get the unboxing experience of buying it brand new,  and earbuds arent included. Im happy i got a discount and that i didnt buy a new one and just have this one sit around and get scrapped for parts or something. I honestly dropped $690 bucks on this thing and i was gonna go ballistic if it didnt show up,  but it came early and im so relieved and happy with it,  its absolutely beautiful. Also the battery life on this for an iphone is great,  i came from a 2016 SE,  so a big change."
24,Excelente teléfono 👍 y muy buena la cámara lo recomiendo 100%
25,My son loved this phone. We had no problems setting anything up. Worked perfect. In brand new apple box as well
26,I just received this phone on Friday(3 days earlier than expected🤗🤗)and it is absolutely lovely🤩. It came in a generic box with an apple compatible charger and cable. No scratches or imperfections that I can see at this time . The battery capacity is 100%. It looks and works like a brand new device.😁😁✅
27,The phone comes in the original iPhone box which was a nice bonus and difference between other companies that send unlocked iPhones in normal cardboard boxes and it works perfectly
28,"I shopped around a lot for a renewed, refurbished iPhone 11. This was not the cheapest but really close. The selling point for me is that it comes with a 90 day warranty and refund policy and is sold through Amazon Prime. We received the phone 4 days ago. Upgraded and transferred everything from the iPhone 7 to the 11 flawlessly. Plus, the phone had no cosmetic issues at all. It looks brand new. We have bought a refurbished iPhone 7 and now this 11. Both worked perfectly."
29,"As far as buying this product from this specific seller, my experience has been great! Nothing to complain about. There were no scratches in the glass display, not to mention there weren’t any on the back glass or camera lenses either. But as far as the phone itself, I’m an android person but my first smartphone happened to be an iPhone and I had gone through a couple generations of them. I’m pleased to say that this device feels great but, it’s still an iPhone and to that, I mustn’t give a full 5 star review. Android gang."
30,I am absolutely happy with my purchase! I’ve gone through the reviews and was ready to order right after. The only thing is my battery health was at 84% as I seen others with 100% which is fine by me. It’s nothing to go get a new battery when and if that time comes. As you see in the pictures the phone is in great condition annnndddd it’s unlocked so you can use any phone service for it. I’m digging the picture quality especially after upgrading from the iPhone X to this. What a difference a upgraded phone makes! It came with a cute case plus a charger. If you’re looking into this phone I’d say go for it. I’m on day 1 and I’m excited!!! (UPDATE! April 18th) I’m 1 month in with the phone and it’s still working great no issues at all.
31,"Work totally fine so far, I’m satisfied with the functionality. But It didn’t come with earphones."
32,"This phone is great! (Please excuse the somewhat blurry pics, I have shaky hands) The battery health was already at 100% and its has barely any cosmetic damage. Save for a super tiny little nick at the top which is barely noticeable unless I shine a camera directly at the area. Also, the phone came preinstalled with a screen protector! I guess its a bit of a minus that it doesnt come with headphones, but I already have airpods, so that doesn’t bother me. It’s something to keep in mind when you purchase anything from Amazon Renewed. The phone came in four days early too which is dope."
33,So pleased. The phone came with a screen protector on it already even! And we’ll placed! No scuffs. Phone is seriously like brand new. Battery is 99%. I was skeptical after a bunch of 1 star reviews but figured I would try it because there is a 90 day guarantee and return. Don’t feel scared about this deal. Try it out. You will be pleased.I got the black 256gb unlocked iPhone 11 just FYI.
34,"After only 3.5 months the phone is completely dead and will not charge.  Took to Apple store and was told it would have to be replaced.  WTH!  Ordered and received early October 2020.  Started having charging issues last week and now it is completely dead.  And wouldn't you know it is past the return date by a mere 12 days.  Come on Amazon, you sold me this product you need to stand behind it or at least replace or refund something that lasts only days longer than the return window.  BS!"
35,"Well I got the iPhone 11 yesterday and it currently right now will shut off every 5-10 mins , I have tried multiple times to contact the carrier and they haven’t emailed me back or nothing which I spent 700$ on a phone I’d like to get atleast a phone I can have a conversation on .. I don’t even want my money back I just want my phone fixed because it’s honestly a great phone but I think you should get a better technician that works on your phones cause I even called Apple to see what they recommend I do (that’s what they said ab the technician ) but I’m just disappointed I was so excited now I just feel ripped off ):"
36,Bought refurbished I’m assuming only open box as the item seemed 100%brand new would recommend the seller
37,It's ok
38,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   The lock screen is flickering and getting blurry .. everything else seems to be fine , I tried to restart it again but it’s not working"
39,For the most part everything is okayDifferent parts of the screen won’t work during certain timesSo I have to lock and unlock my phone constantly Nd hope it will work afterWhile writing this review I can’t even hit the bottom right corner to add punctuation unless it comes up from autocorrectWhen I contacted the company they told me to hard reset it and it should work afterThat worked for less than a day and I don’t want to have to hard reset my phone every other day for it to work when I spent seven hundred dollarsCan’t even use numerical charactersUpdate I reached out to them again saying their advice didn’t work and haven’t received a response and it’s been a week
40,If you’re thinking about buying this buy it right now! I had iPhone 7 and wanted another phone I can have years to come it took me two months to buy this because how much money. When I did BOY! I have never been so happy! I can’t express how happy and thankful iam to this company! Everything transferred over in less than 15 mins it was activate it with metro pcs within 10mins. I do have small hands so sometimes it’s hard to hold with one hand haha! The camera is awesome sound is awesome the color is greatit’s fast and up to date! It came with a screen protector you can buy another one. Get a good case I got mines from metro than I order one from red bubble. My watch paired fast dude! Buy this ASAP you’ll love it calls is cool it drops when I’m in a dead zone but that’s my services obviously turning the phone off tho is weird af 😂😂 buy a real apple charger got mines from Meijers for $20 charge my phone fast the battery life was 100%! It last about a 11 hours until it dies
41,Recomended!!
42,I can’t send messages to anyone who doesn’t have an iPhone. The power button doesn’t work correctly and often times Siri doesn’t respond. The only way to get the issue corrected is to be without a phone until the seller sends me a new one. I’d never buy again or from this company.
43,"Certified. Refurbished. Quality Controlled. 70-point inspection.All indicators that you better insure any and every product purchased under the brand BuySpry because as the name suggests it will break quickly. Hopefully you are one of the lucky ones that buy second hand and receives a product that functions and lasts. You have no assurance or guarantee, just a wish. Be very careful within initial return period (most often 30 days) as any even small issue needs to be addressed. That issue, whatever it may be will prove fatal in due time. It is almost as if devices are programmed to break after 30 days. In my personal case, the iPhone I purchased after a week of normal use suffered critical issue. Customer service did not respond to the most recent message from me via email. After speaking to them on phone they stated resolution would be a refund. Do you have a back up device? I hope so. In the lucky case of an exchange (which I pushed for) brace yourself for longer than promised times to receive new product. There is a chance this turns into groundhog day but I hope you receive a working product that endures.Overall enterprise and business solution, would be to place more in reserves for replacement and increase service ability to send new product with promissory of receiving broken product. Filling this void, keeping customers whole while resolving issue. Leaving customers a loaner device would increase their reputation, making them the tallest in a room of short people but hey, you would purchase with confidence under that premise right? Do not buy from this organization if you plan to gift. Please do your loved one a favor and keep BUYSRY's mediocre business and risk to yourself. Just buy her something new you cheapskate! Good luck and stay healthy."
44,"I have never bought a used phone before and I've never bought one online. I always went through my carrier. However, this time I was ready to save some money and get an unlocked phone. I was a little nervous but I did some research and then took a risk since I had time to return it for a full refund if it didn't work out. The phone came in perfect condition and works like new. To me, I can't tell the difference between this phone and a brand new one! I've been using it for about 4 days and I've had no issues! Definitely worth the risk."
45,Great phones... I initially bought one for my daughter and ended up ordering one for myself
46,"It’s a refurbished phone I don’t mind that it didn’t come in an original box, the phone itself is in very very good shape, I was so skeptical about buying this phone from amazon since it’s my first time buying a phone online but it is in very good condition! No cracks no scratches ! Looks brand new !! Seems to be working fine for now hopefully it stays that way I just need to see if it’ll work with my carrier, it came with a screen protector which was a nice touch :) really happy with the productUPDATE!!!! After a Month or two of having it, it still works really great! Batter life is long and it charges super fast. Highly recommend"
47,"I got this when the battery life in my last phone, the LG V30 started tanking. I figured that I could easily try the current iPhone and sell it again if I didn't like it. I am pleasantly surprised by pretty much everything this phone offers.I'm going to start with the battery life, because that is the because surprise I have had coming to this phone. On day one with my old phone, I would get at max 6 hours of SoT (screen on time) before the phone would die. That was typically enough for me to go from 6am to 10pm with enough left over for me to not feel worried about dying in the middle of the day. Prior to buying this phone that battery life dropped to roughly 3.5-4 hours of SoT before dying.This new (refurbished I know) phone easily gets ~8 hours of SoT, easily going even higher depending on what I'm doing. I can go a full two days without a charge. That's with bluetooth on 24/7. To say I am happy with the battery is an understatement.The other features, are also pretty good. Not anything that blows me out of the water, but definitely at least as good as the other competition. The face unlock, which I assumed was going to be terrible, is much better than I expected. I would still prefer a fast fingerprint sensor, but this thing does the job almost as well. I have had a few instances where it refuses to recognize me on the first attempt, but they are uncommon. The camera is as good as you would expect from a modern smartphone, with several extra features that are actually useful in certain circumstances.Long story short: I will definitely be sticking with this phone for the foreseeable future."
48,"Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, Red - Fully Unlocked (Renewed) arrived in only two days nicely packaged and looks brand new! Only one, barely noticeable scratch on the screen and a very tiny scratch on the side that you can notice if you hold it really close to your face. Overall I'm very satisfied. I've had the phone for 24 hours now, works really well and fast and battery is still going since I charged it yesterday, it's at currently at 29%. If any unusual changes occur in the near future I'll update my review but I doubt it since the phone is in near perfect condition"
49,I received a phone that had a crack in the screen which wasn’t that big of a deal but the something was off with camera though compared it my boyfriends phone who ordered the same one from Apple and I think it was replaced with a different one and the biggest problem with the phone was that it’s kept restarting I thought maybe I was doing it by accident but no it would turn off while I didn’t have it my hand but using my AirPods . I also had problems trying the return the phone as the shipping label they sent roundly be taken by fedex and I had to pay myself all around you’d be better off buying new phone from Apple it ended up being cheaper .all around I paid $780 for the phone unlocked from Apple don’t waste your money
50,"This review is based on the renewed status of the phone and not of the iPhone itself. I had previously purchased a renewed Galaxy phone from Amazon and the phone was practically new for a small fraction of the price and it came with the original box and accessories. I thought it'd be worth it to save $100 or more since my last experience went so well. Unfortunately, the iPhone I received was very visibly used with scratches littering both sides of the phone, but without deep cracks to the screen. The battery's health was on the lower side. The phone also came in a generic box with generic accessories, which was to be expected since it is in the item description, but when you look at what you get for the renewed price it seems like a poor deal. Thankfully Amazon has a longer return period if the phone doesn't work out for you, but I only needed a few minutes with the phone to know that I'd rather buy a new phone from Apple for $100 more."
51,"This was an amazing buy from Kiss Electronics. No issues with phone operation so far, only just received & setup. Was packaged nicely & came with an adapter and a charging cable (no headset). Iphone product Red body was in good condition. Small scratches on upper corner . Very very happy with purchase"
52,"A BIG thank you for selling iPhones on Amazon! I wanted this phone so bad and couldn’t get my hands on it anywhere unlocked. I am so glad I could buy in through Amazon, This is how we get everything so we knew it was reliable. The phone did not come in an apple iPhone box, but a box just the same with a charger no headphones. But I could care less because all I wanted was the phone. Works great, you wouldn’t even know the difference. I have since told friends and family to do the same when looking for a new phone. Plus it was much cheaper then I found it anywhere else. Very pleased that I got exactly what I wanted for an amazing deal!"
53,camera came slightly scratched but overall a good purchase
54,"Just got my iPhone 11 today and I was so anxious of using it but had to wait 2 hours for everything to set up. After that a message popped up saying that my phone screen may not be genuine so I freaked out because it supposed to be all ortigal? Right well apparently the screen is not authentic at all... hope my review and evidence works to y’all. I scanned my phone with a program called 3utools, hope it works."
55,Works great.
56,Not user friendly. I might have to return it. I have to learn how to clean it before I send it back as it loaded my pictures from my other phone.
57,"No scratches or damage on the screen, or, for that matter, any part of the phone! SO happy I took the plunge and bought the phone, it has been well worth it so far!-no scratches or dents anywhere-battery capacity 100%-unlocked & everything as advertised"
58,"The phone came in with scratches on it but after I put the screen protector on you can’t see it and whenever you put the screen protector on it’s gone have some like bubbles I put it on over and over and the bubbles seems to not go away but, overall it’s good I guess it doesn’t have YouTube but I’m satisfied I guess but, the price should’ve been lower than this since it’s refurbished and still come in the mail kinda mess up. The face recognition works fine battery was fine the setup was good only took 5 mins."
59,"So I gave the phone another chance after it kept glitching on me but it’s definitely a no. The phone already came cracked on the side where the lock button is, I guess that’s why the phone won’t power off for me to complete the activation. Second after finally getting the phone to activate after letting it die out for a day because you have to turn a phone off & on for proper activation it finally started to work. I had gotten a screen protector & phone case for this iPhone 11 all for it not to work. After four days of having the phone i could no longer have a conversation on the phone. I could answer the phone & people could hear me but I couldn’t hear them, Then shortly after being on the phone it would hang up & say call failed. When I was on FaceTime the front camera was glitching on the video. I’ve had enough of this phone. Called straight talk this morning to have my minutes transferred to my other phone, will be taking my screen protector & case off && taking my new sims card out to return this phone TODAY for a full refund. This is my second time purchasing a phone from Amazon & BOTH times the phones were defects or glitches how you wanna say. I will NOT be ordering anymore phones online again. First time shame on you, second time shame on me & there will NOT BE A THIRD. People please read these reviews carefully because the person selling you the phone do NOT care. They fix these phones that’s broke & try to sell them thinking they’ve found a dummy because most won’t return the phone but I had a little time today & will have more when I get my refund today. I’ll give the phone one star because the phone takes nice back pictures but THATS IT."
60,"My sister is absolutely in love with this phone 😍 she was so surprised when I gave it to her, very fast shipping packaging was great."
61,"Received phone.  It looked good, then after charging it overnight the screen was a jumble of blurred vertical lines.  Amazon insisted we had to deal with the seller.  Could not clear the phone as the screen didn’t work.  Communication from the seller was scripted, they never really answer your questions.  Sent phone back to seller.  They refunded 1% and kept 99% as a restocking fee!  Then we had to force Amazon to deal with it to get a full refund.  Horrible seller, buyer beware!!!"
62,"It came in perfect condition, no scratches, nothing was wrong. The battery life was at 100 percent. I had no complaints. One thing I noticed was that the app snapchat is glitchy on the phone. If you try to edit something for your story it just discards it after 30 seconds. Other than that,  it didn't come with earphones. As most people know the Iphone 11 has no headphone jack. So it's crucial that when we buy these phones we should get everything like new. Also, the charger is probably only a foot long. I like to play games or change my music while i'm laying down. I can't do that because the charger is so short. Last but not least, when you get the phone, the instructions are horrible. It tells you to download an app and what not, that just glitches your phone. Don't do it. Instead look up a video online on how to insert a sim card into an Iphone. From there, when you turn on the phone it will have instructions set up from apple. Do not! I repeat do not! Use the instructions provided. If you are switching from android to apple, it will take you longer to set up your phone because you need an apple ID. Also, you need to save your contacts, and write them down. Even after saving all my contacts to my sim card, when I inserted it, none were there. So it's crucial to remember your contacts."
63,I paid $ 720 but the screen was scratched.  Should not be bought at this shop.
64,"I requested an exchange because the phone I got reset on me a few times while trying to set it up. Like I had to redo adding my wifi and password, all the settings like country, prompts, etc. They made the return process so easy so I’ll give them props for that! Just got the “exchange” item. IT’S THE SAME EXACT PHONE I SENT BACK! I know because I recognize the small set of scuffs in the top right hand corner. They asked if I wanted the same color and I specified if it was available or I’d even take a white if it was a better option. They just replaced the little back sticker that came off when I had to clean it the first time I received it because it arrived dirty( like how phones get when they’ve been on a case for a while and the random dust/gunk that kind of accumulates) and added a fancy gold charging cord instead of the play white one. For paying over $400 for a renewed phone like this one I’d say OVERPRICED. They should base their prices off of how the phone looks and not just charge the same for all phones. I can say I’m disappointed to say the very least. The battery life is 86%.  The renewed iPhone 8plus I ordered 2 years ago (from somewhere similar) came at 97% battery life. That’s why I had high hopes it would be fine to order renewed.Will not order from again when the time comes to get a different phone. I’ve learned my lesson."
65,"Slight micro scratch on the screen, but overall good condition for an open box"
66,"I’m pleasantly surprised with this transaction.  I’m a true skeptic and regularly conduct extensive research when making this type of purchase.  The phone doesn’t come in original packaging and the cord and wall adapter are definitely not Apple products. The usb connection on the wall adapter had was bent and i could not slide the usb into the adapter....that was tossed into the trash.  With that said, the product I care most about was the phone itself and it is exactly as advertised.  It stared right up and went through start up process.  My entire phone was transferred within an hour and I was on my way.  I’ve been using it for about 4 days now and the battery life is strong and all the features work perfectly (no sticky buttons, etc).  I would definitely recommend this vendor if you only care about getting the iPhone as it’s supposed to be.  If you’re concerned about packaging and having a “uniquely” Apple experience, you may want to pay the additional $400 at the Apple store."
67,"Phone doesn’t work on the providers they say it will. I really wish I’d paid attention to the 1-star ratings before I bought it.Pros: the phone is in great condition and it works wellCons: It’s not really unlocked – or its some weird hardware configuration. It won’t connect to the providers they said it would. I was on a Verizon network and bought the phone so I could switch to sprint. It didn’t work on sprint. I contacted the seller’s support, and they gave me lots of things to try. I tried them long enough for the return window to pass. Then they basically said, too bad for me.If I had it to do again, I’d spend a little more and get something that works properly. Or just returned the phone and got another."
68,"If there was a way to leave a 0 star, I would. I got the phone in the mail, super excited to get it up and running, and it wouldn't turn on. I called Apple and was on a call with them for 30 mins and they couldn't help me get the phone on either. Needless to say, I'll be returning the phone without even getting a chance to use it."
69,All they did was replace the glass. The sides of the phone are all scratched up not refurbished at all and the cables included are all aftermarket... not really pleased with the way the phone looks at all. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money for a new one.
70,The Face ID do not work I tried everything to fix it  In wouldn’t buy from dis seller again
71,"Got my phone in two days rather than five standard shipping days! I was happy it came sooner than expected!  I was nervous about ordering a renewed phone online because I didn’t want to spend $700 on a phone not knowing if it  was damaged or not, but I’m happy to say it came like brand new with no dents or scratches!! I’m so happy I made this choice because it saved me almost $300 from ordering on the apple website. Would definitely take the chance if your looking to buy the phone from them. The phone came in a different box with just a charger, FYI."
72,"The iPhone 11 my son bought from BuySPRY technically works in the sense of being a very expensive digital camera and ipod, but not as a phone.  In august, we were contacted by our phone service provider Xfinity Mobile who said the phone was flagged for being from Asia, possibly counterfeit, and therefore unusable on their system.  Checking with Verizon, ATT, and T-Mobile with IMEI, the answer was the same - nobody wants this phone on their system.  We contact BuySPRY who asked for the IMEI, which I immediately sent, and they have ghosted us since. We are now out of the return window, and my son has wasted his money."
73,"What an awful, frustrating month long experience. Save yourself a ton of grief and aggravation and do not buy a phone here!! This whole experience was tragic. The phone was an absolute complete and total piece of worthless junk. The key board didn't work, it constantly froze up, it muted itself whenever it felt like it. I initiated a return process after the hassle of importing everything onto it then having to reverse the process when I realized the phone was possessed. I contacted the company and their big solution was to have me take the phone to a local repair shop like it was a pair of shoes and get an estimate for repairs, send them said estimate and they would then reimburse for the repair cost if the estimate was to their liking.NO WAY!! Ludacris, absurd solution! I finally had to get Amazon customer service involved, 6 phone calls over the span of a week and they were nice about it but I had to drive the phone 45 minutes to a UPS drop off spot after that and finally got a refund but not for the full price paid so I had to call Amazon AGIAN to get it fully rectified. Even the Amazon representative said this was a totally bogus response and proposed solution from the seller and to not buy 3rd party seller items in future. Lesson learned! Don't waste your time with this company. they sell you junk and make it as hard as possible to return for a refund. one month out and I still don't have a phone. Waiting till Black Friday at this point and buying new."
74,"I was going to buy my girlfriend a bigger phone than her SE2020… but was worried about her not liking it not having a home button. Her fingers don’t always have a good tactile feel and has a hard time doing screen motions.She wasn’t to keen on the Face ID either.So after looking at the IPhone XR, XS Max and the 11, I decided to go with the 11. I looked through about 15 vendors and their review scores. This vendor came through pretty well. There is a small nick in the paint right above the power button, case hides it though.The battery is at 100%!! I did have some questions about the ear speaker. The calls were sounding crackly. I called Amazon and got disconnected but they emailed me and said to try and brush the ear speaker out. I did it and it seems to have helped but I don’t know if it’s 100%.The phone is great, It came with a screen protector on it and I don’t like those at all but it is on there very well so I’ll leave it for now.My girlfriend is getting my IPhone 8+ which has a bigger screen than hers and retains the home button.Overall happy with it, it does take some time getting use to it without a home button but Face ID works well."
75,it seemed like new the thing I didn’t like is was it wasn’t in its original boxing didn’t even last three months and the screen started bugging out since it’s refurbished and the seller won’t help me by swapping it or giving you a refund. I’m mad and upset 700$ for a busted iPhone 11 what a rip off:( don’t buy this product as it’s just a broken phone. Better off buying a new one. They won’t even swap or anything. Like I just want a full refund n to send it back:( very unpleasant
76,Speakers are blown and very crackly. Cannot hear it is so bad.
77,"Not gonna lie, after reading some of the reviews, I was a little hesitant to buy a Renewed phone, but in the end I'm super glad I did it! My phone came a day earlier than I expected, was nicely packaged, and already had a screen protector applied (no bubbles!). Set up and transfer from my old 6+ was simple. Got my apple watch transferred over. Cameras all work great, face ID has no issues so far, etc. Obviously it's been less than a day, but so far, so good! ♥"
78,"Keep in mind these items are refurbished, which means someone else has had them - it may have a screen cover or already have knicks and chips. Based on my experience - there's a huge chance it could have been opened and repaired. If the phone was opened and the water resistant seal wasn't sealed correctly - you may lose the water resistant rating that these phones should have. There's a small chance of that happening, but it could still happen. Good thing - you have an extended 90 day return policy when it comes to Amazon refurbished returns.If Amazon offered unlocked, new phones - I would go that route - unfortunately they don't."
79,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I couldn’t have made a wiser decision about this iPhone 11. First off, it’s almost $60 cheaper than a brand new one, which is practically a steal. Then, it arrives 3 days early, who doesn’t love that? Lastly, I have boost mobile as a phone provider, so purchasing the phone totally unlocked was the way to go, walking into the store and getting the phone activated with the plan I already have took about 10 minutes, all I needed was a SIM card to be put in, which is $10.To anyone worrying about buying this and it being a bust, fear not! I am over the moon, elated about my purchase. Worth every penny."
80,"Not gonna lie i was a little skeptical at first, im like dang did i really spend that much money on this what if its a scam? but im more than happy with the results. Battery health is on 100, phone is in perfect condition, came with new charger (no headphones tho), and there was no trouble transferring data from my old phone to the new one. I didnt even need to call my carrier to turn on the phone, just simply placed my sim card in. Definitely recommend this (if you dont mind the price lol)."
81,I only dislike that I didn’t receive headphones with the order. Everything else was on point
82,It’s refurbish but I got all brand new (apple box with original charger but missing the ear plug)
83,Cheapest iPhone 11 with 128gb that I could find online and I did ALOT of searching. Great buy! Love my new phone and the camera quality is amazing
84,The phone came in great condition. It works great! No lag! No issues! The battery life is great as well. I’m happy with the quality of the phone. I’m happy with my purchase! :)
85,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   ** Edit **The seller provided a copy of the report showing all components were OEM, so it was simply an oversight on the Quality Control of the reseller - which is understandable, since it was only noticed upon angled inspection.*****This phone actually looked amazing - barely any scratches on the case and the screen appeared wonderful.... UNTIL it's held at an angle.  See video clip of how rippled / warbled the screen was - obviously a non-OEM quality replacement job.  And likely a poorly completed job by the seller.when applying screen protector(s) it became horribly noticeable - the protector couldn't fully adhere, leaving bubbles that couldn't rub out because the underlying screen wasn't smooth.  Disaster - waste of 2 protectors.Sad part - this was our 2nd refurb phone, the first had the original glass - but was pretty scratched up.  Not worth $500 as a refurb.  Returned, purchased from a different seller.  Lesson learned - just spend $50 more and buy it new from Apple.com"
86,"Wow... Went to activate phone and Verizon says the phone has been reported as STOLEN?!?!?  The girl at tech support was very nice and issued me a refund. She stated that the phone may not have been wiped clean by the previous owner, but either way, aren’t they supposed to check these things out before simply sending them out to buyers? Wow, I’d expect this on eBay, but not Amazon. ☹️"
87,"Honesty is greatly appreciated these days. They delivered exactly what they promised: The phone arrived timely and it looked brand new. Everything worked smoothly as I expected. Unfortunately, I wasn't very thrilled about the phone size because I have always liked larger phones, so I contacted the seller for a refund. They kindly instructed me as to how to return the item in order to get a full refund back on my card. So far, so good. No complaints and I would definitely do business with these people again."
88,The product came in a timely fashion. I like that it came with a charger no headset though charger not original but can’t complain for the price you are paying great deal and the phone is great condition
89,"i desperately needed a new phone. my phone was starting to give out not only because my old phone was outdated (iPhone 7+), but it was starting to have so many problems. trust me, i did so much research and looking up what type of new phone i should get. i looked for months on end while my old phone was still in good condition. the iPhone 11 was honestly the best purchase i got, it’s so new and improved that i don’t ever wanna switch back to Samsung. i’ve gotten used to the no home button that when i first got it, i didn’t know how to use it😂best part was that i got the iPhone 11 unlocked and it works with my straight talk so i’m pretty pumped about that.thank you!!"
90,"I don’t write many reviews, however, there were some reviews about this iPhone that weren’t good. So I wanted to write a review myself.I highly recommend this phone.I will start by saying that I am impressed with the condition of my new phone. After inspecting the physical shape of the device I am very pleased to say that it looks almost perfect! Just looking at it you can't see anything wrong with it. But after looking closely there are a couple of very small scuff marks on the edge of the phone. But that's not a deal-breaker to me because that's covered by a case.The battery was charged more than 80% and the battery life of the phone is 100%. I have never owned a phone with a battery life over 85%. So far the batter has held a charge for 2 days after using it a good bit.Face recognition and other features work great I have no issues.The  biggest perk of this phone has to be the speaker during phone calls. It works amazing! I can hear the person I'm talking to without having on speaker phone. This is a huge perk."
91,Mine came with a dead pixel and 90 percent battery life. I returned it and just bought a new one. While you might get lucky and get a like new product it just isn’t worth it to me to save 50 dollars. They need to lower their price to around 100 less then new to make me ever think about buying a used phone again.
92,"I had everything transferred to my new phone, when suddenly my first phone call came in. To my surprise, you could barely hear any sound through the speaker despite the volume being turned up to max! Just my luck that the speaker doesn’t work considering I’m blind. Oh well, please give me my money back, and properly test your stuff.UPDATE- after ordering a brand new iPhone 11, which was not much more expensive than this renewed version, I realized that they didn’t even put the correct screen on the one I received from the seller. broken speaker, and incorrect screen. What else will I find wrong next? well, nothing, because I’m sending it back for a refund."
93,"I received the purple iPhone 11 in perfect shape! No scratches or cracks, it’s beautiful! Upgraded from the iPhone 7 Plus and this has been a wonderful transition. Easy to transfer info from iPhone to iPhone, too. Quick shipping, received a day early! Would not hesitate to buy used from them again!!"
94,"All is great with the phone! Came in two days. It was a great upgrade from my 8 plus, very adorable and was delivered to my door in two days conveniently instead of waiting in a Apple store like usual! Will buy again from amazon."
95,"The first phone I received had a problem with the charging port so I sent it back and had no problems with the return at all and another phone was promptly sent with no questions asked. I was a little nervous buying a refurbished phone, but it is now over a month old and working great and I was quite pleased that it came early by Fed-X.The phone came in a nice box that had the iPhone, Apple charger, charging block, and a screen protector already installed on the phone. I transferred the Sim Card from my iPhone 6 into the new phone with no problem. I didn't need to have the phone activated and everything from my old phone transferred readily.I received everything I ordered: iPhone 11, 256 gb, red, and unlocked. The phone looks brand new, has no dents or scratches on the screen. The battery is at 89% but other than that it could be a new phone instead of a refurbished one. The cameras quality is amazing.This is a great phone for the price as I could not afford to buy it new. I am totally pleased with the service that I received and would definitely recommend buying a refurbished phone to anyone needing a new phone but not able to pay the price for a new one!"
96,It was perfect! Even had a screen protector on it
97,I purchased the phone but when I took it to T-Mobil the device wouldn’t allow them to activate it. T-Mobil spoke with the customer care person from the seller but they couldn’t get it to work. So they told me to send it back. Prr rt onlem is now they don’t have anymore … at least not at that price. When asked what they can go for me they said nothing. After they receive the device they will credit me.I ended up buying a NEW one unopened and unused by T-Mobil for $599. Yeah it was $113 more but it is unused AND THIS TIME IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!!! They should at least guarantee me another one at that price or at the very least do something for my troubles. The customer care person was nice and polite. But reiterated that there was nothing he can do and this happens. Unfortunately I wouldn’t recommend this company. But new or from Amazon’s renew store. They at least stand by there products and guarantee satisfaction.
98,"I had to send my first phone back as there was a scratched area on the screen about the size of a quarter. Called Amazon and got replacement ordered right away no problem with Amazon Renewed guarantee.Second iPhone comes and literally the same scratched area on this one too. If I didn’t know better, I would have thought they were the same phone based on the scratched area. I decided to put on a screen protector and see if that minimized the scratches, which it did.I believe the scratches are part of the refurb process or something, but would really have preferred the seller to have done better QC. I didn’t want to send back another time so I kept the phone. Because of that, I give 3 stars. Good price and responsive seller and Amazon was good to work with, but my wife’s phone from another seller didn’t have the screen scratch issue I did.Battery life seems good and no other issues with the phone. I feel like a scratched screen is kinda a big deal though since the screen is the phone basically. It also wasn’t a scuff as I could ever so slightly catch a finger nail on it and I tried to rub it off."
99,Sprint customers transitioning to T-Mobile with the merger. We purchased two iPhone 11s from this vendor. One phone activated just fine. Had problems activating the second phone. Spent 1 hr 40 min at the T-Mobile store. Second phone IMEI was reported 'Lost' by the previous owner. Easy return process and received our refund. Ordering another phone. Hopefully won't run into the IMEI issue again.
100,"I was very excited and looking forward to receive my new iPhone, but now I’m feeling I should’ve paid the extra $50 to buy a new iPhone from Apple directly. At first glance the phone looks great! Came with a screen protector with no noticeable scratches/damages to the phone physically. When setting up my phone one of the first things I noticed was how loud the sound was, sound quality was off too. I had my audio low and on mute and notification rings were still loud. Then I got my first phone call and that’s I become disappointed. It was difficult to hear and understand the other person the phone, I had to switch to speaker to listen. It sounds staticky like if it weren’t plugged in correctly or if speakers were in the wrong place. I’m afraid to go to the Apple store to get the battery replaced (since the battery arrived at 88% health). I’ve only been playing with phone for 6 hours now and have found questionable thing like the audio issue that have disappointed me in my purchase..."
101,"This phone never really worked well (wouldn't install apps, face recognition worked for maybe a week, got a message saying it wasn't an authentic interface... so I wonder if I got scammed and this wasn't even a real iphone) and it had microfractures - fell off the arm of my couch onto carpeted floor (while in protective case with screen protector!) and the back totally cracked. Sent it back and the restocking fee was $574.19 on the purchase price of $579.99.There was an issue getting the Apple ID disassociated with the phone, but after that, the seller did go ahead and refund the rest of the phone price. I wish communication would have been clearer, since I initially thought the restocking fee was almost the price of the phone (that's how it came through) and I was very frustrated about that. I'm grateful it was eventually refunded since phones (especially iphones) are pricey."
102,"Upgraded my phone from an XR to the 11 and have spent 24 hours with it at the time of review.Pros: I got more storage space (128GB vs 64GB), and the upgrade in the camera is great. I also love the green color and am glad it came with a screen protector already on it.Knowing this was a used phone, I wasn’t expecting perfection. However, the screen has two small gouge-like scratches, which is annoying because I can tell this screen is a third-party, cheaper replacement, as it’s backlight is more yellow than the XR screen. It could (and should) have been replaced prior to shipment. Battery health is at 84%, but still lasted longer today than the XR battery with a health of 88% (and under heavier use as I played YT music most of the day). That said, those are the only two issues I’ve been able to find, so there’s no real complaint. The price was right for an upgraded phone."
103,"I purchased this iPhone 11 that said it was unlocked . When I searched for iphone 11a I put Boost mobile only to find out this phone isn’t compatible to boost mobile and I’m really upset and pissed because I spent almost $800 on this phone plus shipping and handling only to find out the phone isn’t even compatible with Boost. I will be getting a refund , credit or something"
104,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   The screen on the left side was sometimes not recognizing my touch, which leads me to look closely at the device and it looks like it's a damaged piece that was repaired.  The device was warded off, looked to be overused,  Camera has scratches and frame dents, mute knob some times does not mute the piece.There are better-refurbished devices for the same price, this one looks to be totally repaired."
105,Ordered this phone because it said it worked for TMOBILE.  It doesn't work with TMobile and it isn't unlocked. It is carrier locked to a different company and cannot be unlocked through TMobile. According to TMOBILE  it can only be unlocked through the original carrier and they don't know who that is. Big waste of time and money! I've asked for a refund but this is just more days of waiting to be able to buy a phone. Writing this review so others can be cautious.
106,I ordered this phone for over $500 on here. It’s supposed to be a renewed fully unlocked phone. Upon receiving the phone I noticed pits and scratches on back of phone which was a no biggie since I have a case for it. But upon installing my SIM card from my existing boost  iPhone into this phone and it wouldn’t work. It just said no service on top corner of phone. I then went to Boost website to try to activate it and then I noticed that they had the same  phone for $449. So decided to send this back and order from boost and I know o won’t have any issues when I transfer my SIM card from my existing phone.
107,"Excellent shape, looks brand new and battery health is at 100%.  Came perfectly padded with charging cord and wall charger.  This was a great buy, doesn’t seem “renewed” at all, appears new."
108,It’s in perfect condition. Arrived with charging cable. No earphones but the description said it didn’t include them. Great purchase and currently using it to write this review.
109,"I was a bit skeptical about buying an iPhone renewed off amazon instead of new but my worries were soon gone after the iPhone came in without any damages and at 100% battery health. Besides not getting the official iPhone box with the earphones, I still received a working charger/power adapter & a screen protector installed on the iPhone already. Very satisfied with my purchase."
110,"I purchased this phone in March to give to my kid sister for her 15th bday. The phone had been working fine for months but then some moisture got it the display and we needed to take it to Apple.To our surprise, the Apple technician pointed out that someone had opened this phone before to change the display and didn’t do it correctly. So moisture was getting in the phone. Aside from that, whoever did it stripped the nails in the bottom of the phone so we have no way of fixing it.I contacted the seller but obviously since it’s been months they are saying WE opened the phone and it’s our fault.Just please be careful who you buy from. It’s bad enough to spend $500 on a phone that was broken.. but to then be accused of having opened it and broken it just too much. We never touched the phone until we took it to Apple.THE PHONE WAS SOLD TO US WITH STRIPPED NAILS AND A BAD DISPLAY INSTALLATION."
111,"Phone was in great condition except the screen. Screen has noticeable damage and deep scratches. Wasn’t included in description, and def not worth the full price of phone. Overall I rather not send it back so I guess I’m dealing w it."
112,The phone itself looks like it was dropped a few times. Scratch is all over it scratched on the back. It's not refurbished like it comes from a recognized company. It's refurbished like it came from a friend that had it for a few years and decided to give it away because of how scratched up it has come. It is not working now and I'm about to send it back. The thing stopped turning on completely after putting a $80 case on it. Never dropping it. It practically never leaves my computer desk and still is having problems working. I don't understand this
113,"This phone is practically new. Absolutely no signs of use but a tiny scuff beside the flash on the back of the phone which doesn't hurt the usability and is barely noticeable. The battery is at 100% capacity. Packaged in generic box with a generic charger. When received, there was already a screen protector on the phone. Was able to set up with my carrier immediately. I use straight talk, all I had to do was transfer my information from my current iPhone to this one and move the SIM card from current phone to this one. The process took 10 min at most."
114,"Save your $ and just buy a new phone. I was already having problems with an iPhone XR that I bought that was acting up when I decided to get this one to replace it. I was hoping the issues experienced with that phone would be resolved but unfortunately not. The microphone sometimes drops out and the phone often drops lots of calls. About once a call it cuts out completely for about 3-5 seconds (can't figure that one out). Now with the latest update it no longer calls out the turn by turn navigation with the native apple maps application. If apple is hoping that people wish rush out to buy a new piece of garbage like I did to replace the older problematic one- this isn't going to help them sell more phones. In fact, I may just be ready to migrate to the ""dark side"" and go get a Pixel 6 next!"
115,It was my first time buying a phone online. I upgraded from the iphone 7. This product came exactly as advertised and works really well. I was a little skeptical buying it but it works great and i have no problems. The shipping was quick too.
116,"Plus the BUY BACK Program is a scam.  They try to low ball you,  AFTER saying the expected amount they'll give you AFTER you've already sent it in.  Then if you don't accept you get it back weeks later.  Plus I sent it in with a brand new ""Real Apple Charge Cable & Charger"" and they KEPT the cable and charger, only returned the phone.  The phone I traded in, was in better screen shape than the screen on the phone I purchased.  Will NEVER do this again."
117,I waa skeptical about getting this iPhone because it was a renewed product and it was via Amazon not an iPhone dealer. My kid had received a couple of hundred dollars in Amazon gift cards and some cash for her birthday. I wanted her to have a new phone but I didn't want to be under a contract so purchasing was the best bet. I read the reviews and read up on the Amazon Renewed program and it seemed like a good deal. The gift cards helped defray the cost. She got what she wanted in perfect condition. I purchased the warranty for extra protection and we took it to Metro PCS by T-Mobile and they set it up without a hitch. I will use the Renewed program again. I saved about $100 over the cost of a new phone and was able to purchase a case and shield with change to spare.
118,"When I turned the phone on, it began powering off and on several times, so I knew something was wrong. Would not stay connected to my wi-fi, tried to update it and the screen went black and stayed black. I took it to a repair shop and it couldn't be fixed. Just sent it back. I've bought my last two refurbished phones on Amazon and never had a problem. Not sure about these ""renewed"" phones. My son bought one a few months ago and his was fine. So buyer beware it's a gamble."
119,The phone came i excellent condition looked like it was new 100% battery  works great
120,I was a little skeptical about buying an iPhone off of amazon but I’m super happy with this phone it was brand new  and came with a full battery. It was very easy to set up...and it is fully unlocked so you can get any type of phone carrier you want. Definitely would recommend people to buy.
121,I love this so much ! The vendor was one of the only ones who had yellow iPhones available at a good price. I just upgraded from a iPhone 8 that I had for less then a week due to it size. Now this is everything I wanted and more. I love yellow lol. Also I was so happy to see there was a screen protector already in my phone. Like really? That’s a win. I now have 4 extras just in case . It’s also a lot faster then my iPhone 8 and transferring my stuff  was eAsy.
122,"Hi everyone. This phone is the biggest amazon purchase I've made and I don't regret it! I was hesitant at first after reading some horrible reviews about other phones online, but this hasn't disappointed me yet. The phone arrived in excellent condition- like brand new. Ive had it almost 2 weeks now and I've had ZERO issues. I bought a separate case and screen protector - I've dropped it several times already (i'm clumsy) and it still held up great. No issues with the touch screen. The battery life is amazing!!!! If you have doubts, I hope my review helps you seal the deal :)"
123,"Phone came with a screen protector on it that had a scratch on it...or seemed to. Screen protector cracked so I removed it and there’s not only one huge gouge but another one and a scuff mark on the screen. Touch screen doesn’t always work the best either. As soon as I get a replacement, I will be sending it back :("
124,I was a little scared to buy a phone off line and was really excited when it came in the mail earlier than expected. But sad to say that the left side of the touch screen doesn’t work most of the time and will have to return. Very disappointed in my purchase
125,"This phone is terrible.Have to send a text 4 times to get it to send. Then sometimes it still won't go through. Keeps saying update- EVEN AFTER IT UPDATES. Constant WIFI error. Won't ring/ and when it does....you might miss your call because you're unable to answer it. SO DISAPPOINTED - Because I bought this phone, to give as a birthday gift. Will try the updates and trouble shooting one more time, before returning it. I so regret this purchase."
126,I was quite skeptical about buying an iPhone from here but when mine came in the mail those suspicions left. Mine came basically new with only a few tiny scratches. 100% battery life and everything worked perfectly! Totally worth it tbh
127,Please don't waste your money. This phone is a POS and was definitely tampered with in a malicious manner before being sold. After many months of owning this device here is my review:Pros:Works like a normal iPhone (for the most part until it doesnt after a few months)Main camera seems to be real and works good (surprisingly)The operating system works perfectly so farCons:Came in sketchy 3rd party phone box with 3rd party chargerTrue Depth Camera for Face ID was completely removed and replaced with a fake one.Volume very frequently bugs out and becomes quiet until you mess with it and goes back to normal then does the same thing over and over.Wifi & Cellular connection is really bad I frequently have to restart the device numerous times to make it connect to the internet again.Update: Phone has completely stopped working when under 50% battery and Screen is popping out of place on the left side.In Conclusion this phone is one of the biggest wastes of money I’ve ever spent. DO NOT BUY REFURBISHED PHONES ON AMAZON! I will revisit this review as more problems with this device very likely occur.
128,"My phone operated terribly. The time and date were never correct on my phone, the notifications didn’t work, the sound was crackly so any time i would listen to music or anything it would crackle. speaker phone didn’t work, the front flash was completely foggy there were dents and chips in the phone itself when it arrived. I tried various methods to fix these things and i contacted the seller and all they said was to return the phone. they did not say they’d exchange it or they’d fix my phone and we’re not helpful at all. i returned the phone and just bought one from apple it was only 30$ more."
129,"I brought three(3) of the phone for my family and they work okay for a month. After that month of use it become disaster because they all came down with a battery problem. The phone would literally shut down while I'm on important calls, it was extremely hot🔥 and the battery wasn't holding the charge. I personally replaced the battery with the original batteries and same thing occur. The reason I couldn't return was because I was out of the country and wouldn't be able to return in time."
130,"( 62  days old) bright light on bottom  pages disappears, phone freezes,  s amazon told seller to send another one. Been waiting 3 months seller keeps on refusing.  Amazon promised me that they will talk to him and I will get another one. Called 4 times since April.  I would  never buy from this seller again. Only amazon direct where they have  control  Also the phone gets very very hot and can not hold a charge for  long time  battery wears down fast"
131,"So i'm going to be completely honest, i was extremely worried about spending the amount of money i did on amazon. But with that being said the phone arrived extremely fast, and is in close to Brand new condition with the exception of a tiny nick on the bottom right corner of the phone, which is no biggie at all. I have had the phone for about a month now and it has been ABSOLUTELY  AMAZING! no problems as of now and highly doubt there will be any... fingers crossed. side note It does not come in the original box or  at least mine didn't which for me personally is not a problem, just wanted to give a heads up. Highly recommend, Good luck!"
132,"I thought these phones were checked and tested however the phone screen will glitch and type or delete different stuff than what was being typed. Camera and other apps will open or close on it's own. I'm assuming the phone had a screen replaced or something and was repaired wrong. Return process has been a big hassle and I'm about to call my bank to reverse charges. I checked Apple and I could have bought the exact same phone, brand new, for the exact same price. This seller should consider selling better phones and as these are referbs, sells for less than new. Will never buy a referb phone from Amazon again and am questioning Amazon all together as they couldn't help in the return process either."
133,"My sister finally talked me into getting an IPhone.  For a 3 month return policy I thought, why not?  Not a techy gal by any means, so in a nutshell mine works well.  My battery was at 84% capacity when it arrived.  Very user friendly and like how I can connect easier to other IPhone users than when I had an android.  Have had it for a week now and like it a lot.  Still a little pricey for a phone but it does have a good camera and good responsiveness.  I love my color which is Green.  Also happy I went for the 128GB storage.  Will probably end up keeping it👍🏻"
134,"My first Apple product since the ipod.  Which still works BTW.  I suffered through a whole series of android phones.  Had issues with them.  Calls dropped, bad reception.  Calls I was waiting for going directly to voicemail.  I blamed my carrier and I was wrong.  It was the phones.Easy to use.  Better texting/fast fewer mistakes.  More intuitive.  So simple to pair accessories.  Just works effortlessly.  I have excellent reception and the phone works all the time.  It is reliable and it seems sturdy, not cheap.  I am now an Apple person.  My next computer will be Apple too.  I am done fighting with technology.  I want it to work for me and Apple does that."
135,"I bought this phone the first time over a month ago. When I unboxed it, the keyboard did not work and I couldn't even get past setup. On the second phone, the screen flickered every time I pressed a button. The only good thing I can say is that the return process was easy. These are not ""certified"". They have been checked for physical damage and that is all."
136,Was skeptical as well. Although it came faster than expected and was perfect it felt like a new phone from Apple expect for obvious reasons. Nothing is different about this phone expect for where you are getting it from. Mines came fully unlocked working no scratches or cracks.. Stellar phone In general
137,"My phone was delivered before the promised date, well packaged and just what I ordered. I have since set it up and it is running magnificently. I absolutely am so delighted with my phone"
138,"I love it so much!! Definitely an upgrade for sure i had the iPhone 8 previously ! It was about $100 cheaper than the apple website!! A few people mentioned in there reviews that they received a screen protector with there phone but i did not, it did come with a charger, the block for it!! I am very satisfied I didn’t have to call my phone company either to have the phones/ sim card switched it did that all its self which i love, it made the process so much easier!! I did go ahead an buy a case & protector & that was the part that got me most i could buy phone case & protector along with the phone & it was still under what apple was trying to sell it for! Thank you amazon P.s. no cracks, dents, or scratches that i can see! Also came early!!"
139,"Before buying I specifically selected ""unlocked"" when prompted to select a carrier. After hours of trying to activate and switch over my service, I spent another hour on the phone with my provider only to find out that the phone was locked. Then to make matter worse the phone would not allow me to log into the app store, or transfer my data over. I'll most likely return the phone because I am so angry about everything that I just went through. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It's a hassle and a half and you're most likely going to have to return it too."
140,"Este es mi tercer equipo renovado comprado en amazon , y no me ha decepcionado.Fisicamente el equipo en excelentes condiciones, 0 rayones, trae el protector de pantalla puesto (tenia un globito pero algo diminuto)El telefono es muy rapido, la bateria vino 88%, y tengo unos 2 meses ya con el equipo y esta funcionando perfecto…solo en 1 ocacion se me frizio , solo lo apague y encendi y todo bien…me parecio leer que traia un cover de regalo el cual no lo trajo pero si el cargador con su cable generico.Recomendado"
141,"I purchased the iPhone 11 from Hybrid IT a week ago , it arrived on time . As with any renewed phone I check to make sure everything is working , Cameras , Face recognition , Speakers . Everything was looking good then I went to see if the wireless charging works ,an it didn’t connect . I thought well maybe it’s my charger , So I took it to APPLE and low and behold the wireless charging back does not work .When buying renewed phones I’m aware there may be some cosmetic scuffs or scratches but when something is internally wrong with the phone like the last one sold to me with a broken speaker from hybrid . Are ya’ll not checking your phones before you send them out bcs at this point it feels like it  ?? This is ridiculous .I’ve called them multiple times and they won’t answer I need a replacement phone or my money back!"
142,"I bought this phone for $700 a couple of months after Apple released the iPhone 11.  This phone worked right for maybe 4-5 months. Now every 30 minutes it disables because the temperature is too hot. My phone loses connection every 30 minutes no matter how important I am in need of my phone to make calls, it loses service. I have service with straight talk. I have for years, as soon as I put this phone on their Phone service, it automatically started to give me problems. Straight talk has never led me to have issues but if you buy a phone from Electronic Deals from Amazon you'll definitely wind up with a whole lot of problems and wasted money."
143,"I love ittttt! I was a little skeptical at first, but I love this phone! It came with a charger, and it came in a day early!"
144,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   The phone keeps on turning off and on over and over on its own when I open an app it keeps turning off and on over and over. Not worth buying. Returning the phone"
145,"After having this iphone 11 for just 3 days, I've come to realize that there are issues with the phone that were not addressed before it was sent to me. After fully resetting and updating the phone, checking the sim card with my service provider, and even taking it to multiple phone repair shops to have it checked... The phone still completely restarts without any warning up to 10 times in an hour. The device also seems to have some screen sensitivity issues and sometimes it will not respond to touch for several moments before working. On top of that, this phone hasn't been able to locate any of the bluetooth devices in my home that other members of the household are easily able to connect to.I honestly don't know what went wrong here considering all the other good reviews, but let's just say you're definitely taking a chance if you buy a refurbished phone. I guess I'm going to have to send this one in for a refund... an unfortunate waste of time."
146,"I don't usually write bad reviews, specially ones that focus on the seller and not the product but I feel it's important for all of you to know my story.I purchased the Red 128GB iPhone 11 from CPRTX. The phone was barely used, inside an office but it was a needed line. A screen protector and cover were installed as the phone was being setup.Over a month of use, the screen started playing games. It would show random patterns or freeze but given that there were updates in between those days, I thought it had to do with updates. However, the issues would continue to happen more and more often and lasting longer so I decided to return, since it was obvious the screen was faulty.CPRTX decided the only thing they needed to return was 72 cents out of the $564 of the phone. Despite being covered by the A to Z Amazon Guarantee, I'm still fighting for my refund - and hope I don't get $565 stolen from them. They keep saying I damaged the phone but their own pictures show a pristine, perfect screen, except when turned on.Otherwise, the iPhone 11 was impeccable. You could tell they did some work by looking at the screws at the bottom but other than that, beautiful. The screen did not seem original but it was working great and so was everything else. You could not believe someone had used that phone before which confirms that there are people out there, like myself, who take really good care of their devices.iOS 14.6 works great in the iPhone 11 and the camera does a better job than the iPhone 6 Plus it replaced. You will also enjoy the added screen size (if you're coming from any of the iPhone Pluses) despite having a smaller device. I do miss TouchID and you will too. Overall, iPhone 11, a great phone. CPRTX - Thieves!So a big warning. Do not trust this (CPRTX) seller. They will do everything in their power to steal from you and do not care if the ship to you a faulty phone. They feel Amazon backs them up. I will update if something new happens."
147,"If there is ever a phone I was ever so pleased with, it’s this one. I got it during quarantine time because I had accidentally put my old phone in the washer. Anyway, this phone is excellent for a refurbished. From face recognition, battery life span, camera quality, storage, I wouldn’t ask for a better phone. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to but iPhone 11 for an affordable price, one year now and my phone is still intact. Bought another one for my brother and he was not disappointed. I also got them in their apple packaging with accessories which is unbelievable because I thought I wouldn’t by the comments. 10 stars, get you this phone."
148,Don't buy anything from BuySPRY! I didn't realize the issue was a defective product that BuySPRY sold me until after thier crappy warranty. It's obvious to me now that this phone never worked correctly and they sold me a defective product. I'm going to tell everyone that BuySPRY refurbished work is terrible or maybe not even refurbished. They cost me lots of money and heart ache with no concern or even care to offer a real solution. No one should buy thier junk but pay just a little more to get the something real.
149,I Love This Phone To Be a Renewed Phone It's Awesome. For Almost $700 it's A Great Buy.
150,Phone came in amazing shape. It didn’t come in it’s original Apple box which is fine and it didn’t come with the original apple charger which is also okay! It still came with a nice lengthy charger regardless. The phone has 100% battery capacity and it had absolutely no dents or scratches on it.
151,Buyer beware... be very careful buying these refurbished phones. I received mine which was supposed to be able to be used on T-Mobile's network. I took it into the store to link it to my plan and was informed that it could not be used because it is currently registered to another user.  So it either was not wiped clean or was stolen. Returned and received a refund.
152,"Purchased this only to have the speaker go out in 4 months ( fitting since the seller ""warranty"" window is 3 months).  Took it to best buy and they wouldn't work on it because it is an international version.  Now I have to either pay $600 to fix a non-us version or but a new one.  I knew 8 was taking a chance on a ""renewed"" device, but this is ridiculous.  Worst decision ever buying this one.Word of advice, when buying a phone, verify with the serial number that it is in fact the correct version."
153,Absolutely wonderful product. Bought refurbished from Amazon warehouse. Looks and performs as brand new. Fantastic. The product arrived one day earlier than promised.
154,I was pretty worried about getting a refurbished phone off of amazon but this is definitely worth the buy! It doesn’t come in the Apple box or has earphones but the phone is in amazing condition! It looks brand new and has full battery capacity but also it comes with A tempered glass screen protector on the phone!
155,Good phone for the price
156,"I was skeptical lol, but the phone arrived in 2 days via FedEx. There are no scratches or any sign of wear. It came with 86% charge and fully unlocked. I was able to switch my sim from my android to the iPhone with no problem. I am beyond satisfied with this renewed phone. No lagging or slowness to the phone. It did come with a generic charger instead of an apple charger. That was the only thing I was sad about, but the charger works well. I'm happy nonetheless."
157,"So far so good, I have only had the phone a few days, the delivery process went smoothly. The phone did look fairly new the only give away was that it did not come in the apple box and I did not receive an original apple charger to use with it, but I purchased my own. For the price I feel like I did get a good deal, definitely better than paying over a thousand just for the original box and charger and earbuds, I believe that is all I’m missing. The phone did appear unlocked, I use AT&T and it works fine with it."
158,"First This phone is not unlocked, so that is a lie, it will no work with Verizon, and then it is shipped with fedex! FedEx is not reliable! The phone was supposed to be here 2 weeks ago, still a not here! Just buy a new phone and save yourself a lot of time. It is not worth the few bucks you save buying this one!"
159,"I got this phone earlier than the estimated time which was nice cause I really needed a new phone. Everything works fine, was refurbished gr8tly. However, the whole purpose of looking for a phone was to make sure it was unlocked through any carrier. I go through boost and it’s hard to get phones under boost so I normally look for unlocked phones. It says it’s unlocked in packaging and on here… I began the activation process … and it wouldn’t not let me I looked further and went to setting and under SIM card it said it was locked!!!! It’s disappointing because I have to go through so much to get it unlocked and now I can’t even use the phone until then !!! The product was promoted as unlocked as well as the paper work that came with the phone! It’s just frustrating because I rely on my phone a lot. And to not have one is such an inconvenience especially after I paid for it to be unlocked which might not only cost me out of pocket but my time. I might as well have bought a phone from my carrier. But I love getting them from Amazon I got my last phone from here and had no issues but now it’s like I don’t want to even purchase phones from here anymore ! I’m really disappointed 🥺."
160,"It came defective in certain parts of the screen - it didn't feel the touch. I could not even enter my Apple ID because it didn't catch certain letters from the keyboard, especially the ""o"".For that reason, I couldn't pass the factory settings to check the cell phone in other aspects such as the camera, the battery, or the speakers.When I contacted the company, they told me they regret the problem (they only attend Monday to Friday - 9:00 am - 5:00 pm EST). After some e-mails, they asked me to take the cell phone to a repair shop to inquire about a QUOTE of a diagnosis and estimated repair cost.Finally, they told me that the only thing they could do was give me the refund and not the replacement of the product because ""they don't have it in stock""."
161,After a month or so the phone is horrible. Turns off all the time randomly. Amazon customer support has been useless as they tell me I have to take the phone to the apple store. I just want to send it back and go to my phone carrier and pay the extra for a phone that ACTUALLY works. I bought two of these and the other one is the exact same issues.Update: took both phones to apple and they’re both listed as MFG date for the year 1978. Apple said these phones were supposed to be sent back to apple for repairs and never made it and was “re-sold” to me. Returning them as we speak to hopefully get a return 😑
162,The phone should be water proof but after putting the phone in water it shut off. Extremely disappointed.
163,I had the phone for less than a month and it worked beautifully but then it wouldn't turn on anymore wouldn't work no matter how long I charged it or where I took it. So I requested a refund and sent it back and it has been over a month and still no refund. Be careful guys.
164,"The top right side of the screen is extremely scratched. It is apparent that even though the screen is very scratched, the screen has been replaced. The phone is giving an error message saying that it can not support the display screen. Phone is extremely slow and won't let me sign into my icloud account. Very disappointed in the purchase."
165,Good
166,"After a delay of two weeks of receiving the phone, and after getting it set up at my Verizon store, the battery lasted one month!  My Apple store told me it would take 5 days to get a new battery for the phone. I was so exasperated that I would be without a phone for that long I traded it in and bought the 12pro. Never again will I buy a refurbished phone! This really cost me."
167,"Seriously, pay a little more and buy new. The phone did not operate as expected. The phone would drop calls and once pictures were taken you couldn't get them off the phone using a USB cable. The phone would display an error every time you connected using a USB cable. This was tried using multiple computers and each time it would start the transfer and then error out. We are now having issues getting a refund. I am very disappointed and hope I can get a refund."
168,The phone is very nice looking and it was so easy to set up the phone. It took no time to set up phone and for all my stuff to show back up on here. I suggest that if u have a phone u should do the trade in option like i did because you can get money off the phone. Only problem I had is thatthe phone wasn’t updated and I had to wait an hour to update the phone. But other than that overall nice phone! The seller was super nice btw and very helpful :) I will do a one month update on this phone so watch out for that. (I’ve had it for a week now)Update :Phone really isn’t unlocked to all carriers but overall the phone is ok ig. It’s it works only with cdma networks 🤦🏽‍♀️ Not happy
169,"This was a ""refurbished"" iPhone 11. The packaging was fine, professionally packed with all the included items as described. It had 81% battery life, also as described. However, as I was setting this phone up for my wife, I discovered the screen had been replaced with an ""unauthorized"" screen. As I was prepared to explain to my wife that the the ""big red balloon"" with the number 1 in setting was just fine, the phone locked up and would not restart, including a full reboot of the system. Returned to the seller the same day. Let's see if I get a refund properly."
170,The phone came without a scratch.  Easy to set up.  Everything works.
171,Absolutely amazing and so glad I made this decision! Definitely worth every penny
172,I received the phone two weeks ago and I was a little nervous after some of the reviews I've read about renewed phone. It came in a generic box and the phone was inside a bubble wrap package. I quickly inspected the phone and it was perfect. It looks practically brand new. It also came with free screen.  Booted the phone and completed the setup. Phone works great so far! Will keep everyone posted if anything change.
173,Honestly it was because of the reviews why I trusted the seller. And it was worth it. Can’t complain no scratches no damage no issues what so ever. I wild recommend anyone to them. I use metro pcs as my carrier and they do support this phone. Plus I get to keep my bill low. Win win.
174,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I always buy used phones but the last phone I bought battery was messed up (it’s was a iPhone 6s)  and desperately needed a new phone I came across this phone on here and was Skeptical because not a lot of people left reviews but the reviews that were left were good there was only two bad reviews so I decided to buy it I bought This phone in purple With 128 GB unlocked it came 3 days earlier than expected it came with a charger and a charging box didn’t come in in the original box or with the earbuds but I didn’t expect it to come with that anyways the phone  its self is in great quality there are no cracks no chips nothing Iv been using the phone for 3 days now and haven’t had any problems the Face ID is fast and working everything about the phone is fast Nd the battery life is amazing the camera is so HD and the speaker is loud all around the best phone. of course not everyone will get the same phone sum might come with cracks sum might not but I would recommend to buy and try it if it don’t work just send it back but this is wroth it I plan on buying another one for my sister"
175,"I recently started looking into getting my younger brother a  new phone so we could keep in contact  but unfortunately I couldn’t find a older model iPhone that wasn’t renewed for sale on Amazon so I decided to roll the dice and hopefully get a unsold warehouse phone but that unfortunately wasn’t the case here, when the phone came in the package the box had dirt and pine needles in it along with the phone that was wrapped in bubble wrap and laid on top of the charger cable. In the pictures show there were metal chips along the edges and buttons on the side and a clearly visible circle shown on the back of the phone along with the label put directly on it. I did not test the phone further because I already knew that it was unacceptable to give to my brother this phone in the condition it was in, I have requested a refund already and want to warn people of the risk that comes with ordering a renewed phone that is all I have for this review and I hope whoever reads this can make a more informed decision on their purchase."
176,"Excellent condition, like new. Very happy with it so far."
177,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.  Purchased a refurbished iPhone 11 and it never connected to cell service correctly until eventually it stopped working altogether.  I got a new SIM card and still nothing. Went to apple store and they ran diagnostics on it and found that the phone was faulty.  Had to spend $500 to replace the phone.  This seller is fraudulent.  Do not trust that they will sell you a working product.  Buyer beware
178,"When arrived, battery life was already at 80%. My husband has had this same phone for two years and he’s still in the 90’s. After researching, I was able to get the same phone for very close to the same price at the Apple store near me and it was brand new.  The refund process was fairly easy though."
179,"very visible scratch on screen at top right corner, seller described this junk as like new condition. I thought I am saving $80 dollars by getting a nice like new product but was very disappointed. Packaging was done by a 3-4 years old for sure. whoever think this junk is in new condition need to have their eyes checked. Total waste of time."
180,When I unboxed the iPhone the touch screen didn’t work. I drained the battery and charged it up and that got the touch screen working.When I tried to use my newly purchased SIM card from Straight Talk it did not work!The iPhone Is locked and will not except the SIM card!
181,"Reviews ask for battery life, facial recognition, and fingerprint reader. The facial recognition software and fingerprint reader are ios software so that should be the same across all devices. That being said they both work as they should on the device. The device was in great shape, looked like a phone I would get at the store of my service provider. But my black and red service provider doesn't sell devices outright, so here we are. Order her this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend and upon powering it up, setting it up I am more than happy with the purchase. If you need a bare device these guys sell a good product, no scratches, no cracks, full functionality etc. Came with the new USB c charger block and cord wrapped, and the Sim card tool. Looks brand new and the price was decent. I am satisfied."
182,"Brand new phone, are at least it was supposed to be. The screen came scratched! The company place a screen protector over the top to hide, so sent it out damaged in the first place. Very disappointed in the large purchase and already damaged!!"
183,It didn't work out of the box. The number 8 wouldn't work and the downloading of software from the old phone had to be restarted 3 times. Returned it. Bought a 10 refurbished from iPhone. The return was easy so they do stand behind their product and the refund was prompt.
184,"i was a little weary about buying an iphone from a third party seller, but this phone is amazing quality! it came with an apple charger, and there were absolutely no scratches or damage on the phone. it works like new and the maximum battery capacity was at 100%. it’s super fast and the camera quality is amazing. for about 300 dollars less, it’s an amazing deal"
185,"This iPhone 11 came at a great price and it was in pretty good condition. Not great, but that is to be expected from a refurbished iPhone. Has a few scratches here & there, but nothing too major. The battery was at 93% of its life; therefore, it is still really good. Everything works on the iPhone and more importantly my daughter was able to upgrade from an 8 to the 11 without us having to agree to a new contract with AT&T."
186,"It’s perfect <3 My date got me this phone as a v times day gift and I just absolutely love it there’s no problems at all (not a paid review lol :,> ) there are a few scratches on the side but it’s nothing a phone case can’t fix the back and front came with no scratches for me but for everyone it may be different there are absolutely NO issues with the phone easy to get in adding you Apple ID and everything it’s just a overall good phone! So if your having second thoughts about ordering this Don’t it’s indeed the real deal :> ok I’m done now follow me on Instagram and tik tok tho and if you need more information on this feel free to contact me @Jxstsalt on Instagram and tik tok <3"
187,I purchased the black iPhone 11 and it came in with no scratches or dents in the phone. The screen was also flawless. The battery percent was at 100%. I am satisfied with my purchase and would definitely buy from BuySpry again!! Also this is my second amazon refurbished phone purchase. 10/10 would recommend
188,"We bought this phone just before Thanksgiving 2021 for our daughter for Christmas. I was unable to provide an honest rating due to not opening it.Now that it's been a few days, my daughter absolutely loves it! She states that the battery life is exponentially greater than her old iPhone 5 and the photo quality is immaculate! She loves the green color and everything about it!"
189,This phone came in only two days. The phone came with a sturdy charger and charging box. The phone also came with a glass screen protector on it which I REALLY appreciate bc I can NEVER get mine on perfectly. This one is on PERFECTLY. the battery life was at 100%. In perfect condition. Even came w ab 80% battery.
190,After a three year hiatus of wanting another phone from the iPhone 6plus which by the way was a replacement from my 8plus at the time … yea I know you all like what the … lol yes times was hard lol came across this phone read the reviews and since I’ve purchased online in the past I’m like why not shipping was like less then 48 hrs! Phone arrived without original packaging but they did a great job package that once it get to you it’s in a safe condition! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PHONE!!! Battery life greAt! The speaker sound is Amazing! But the Camera’s!!!!!!! Take the cake all the way home! I feel like a realPhotographer! Lol I be ready to go to nature trails etc! This is definitely a GREAT BUY for an FANTASTIC price!!! 👌🏽
191,"I usually never do reviews, I just read them, but for the people wondering if this phone is a good purchase or not after reading these. I say step out on faith because it was most def a good purchase .I got the standard shipping ( cheaper ) & it was supposed to deliver a week later, but I received it the next day.The battery life was at 0% which is no big deal for me, I don't really trip about stuff like that.I expected it to not be in the original box & only have the charging cable, but I received it w/ a charging block as well & it wasn't in the original box. It was absolutely perfect as if nobody had used it.The camera is amazing, by far the best & cheap purchase . It took it a minute to transfer and update, but besides that it's been good.I was also concerned it about it not being unlocked fully as tho I seen several reviews that said their's wasn't, but mine definitely came unlocked. I'm very grateful for it & I'll be back with a week update ."
192,"Eh. In my opinion, it’s just as expensive as a brand new phone but it appears gently used. T-Mobile full price was 599.. this phone (shipping + cost+taxes) was 592.. It came with a non brand charger, it’s got minor scratches on the screen and some around the border. Battery is alright. Fortunately, nothing major. It shipped next day for me so that was good. I’m still debating sending it back but set up takes a while so you contemplate keeping it. I was a little worried about security but it seems alright..."
193,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   While to the eye it's alright at first impression, the phone is  has a lot of issues. The ""like new"" description, and the overall positive reviews of a renewed device seemed promising. However the device I received was COVERED in scratches, it hadn't even been wiped off it seems.The top volume button as well is sticky, I don't believe this device was even cleaned. In the era of COVID, that's a bit concerning. If it weren't for the hardware inside working alright this would've been a total flop.While I am glad to have an IPhone, I am not glad to have had the wrong idea from the plethora of reviews of the Renewed service. I thought I would be receiving a ""Like New"" product, not a Iphone that was just chucked out.Overall, it's a good phone. The renewed service however needs some work. At the very least cleaning should've been done."
194,Great product so far I’ve been waiting some time to write this review because people say it breaks after a week to a month it’s been a little over a week and it’s been great looks brand new no issues whatsoever I’ll keep you updated however.Continued: about a month later idk I’ve been having connectivity issues. It isn’t that big of a deal but it’s too much of a hassle to be sent a new phone so I make do but I’ll probably end up getting a new one.
195,I bought this phone yesterday since I had broken my other phone and needed a new one fast. But since getting it hooked up and working yesterday (the same day I received it)  the earpiece is scratchy and distorted to the point that you cant hear the person's words when they talk.  Seller so far has not been easy to work with and this is not worth the money.
196,"I was really excited to upgrade from XR to this phone and the first thing I noticed on it was the camera has scrapes around it , I almost noticed holes or something on the color pain job around it. Not sure if that’s supposed to look like that but it made me feel grossed out a little 😫. I did notice a scrape on the side of it as well. I knows It’s a refurbished phone but I paid 550 for it and not sure if I want a refund to just buy a new one off of the Apple store."
197,"I was very skeptical about buying a renewed  iphone. The phone arrived like a brand new iPhone, not a single dent or scratch and it has been working perfectly"
198,Very nice It’s not a scam
199,It is a rebuilt item that claims to be new and is fine in appearance and functionality but it only lasted 5 months. I told the provider about this and he did not reply. Be careful buying in this store as there is a risk of losing your money. I have bought about 50 items in the year on Amazon which makes me a good buyer and this supplier is the only one who did not offer me anything in return
200,"I received the phone on January 13th. I have been using it for a couple weeks, so that it could run the battery performance check. Once completed it is now showing that my battery health is at 87% of maximum capacity. It is now January 30th as of this review. Concerning as I will have to then, presumably replace my battery within the year, probably just outside of the 3 month warranty window. I understand it’s a refurbished phone, but you would think they would at least swap the battery out with a new one or run a performance diagnostic. Everything else is mediocre-to-fine.  Issues with swiping up to get to Home Screen, odd lock-up’s and having to close apps, issues with facial unlock, etc... Semi-minor things such as that. I gave it 3 stars because it’s running okay (possibly even as expected), but the battery is rather concerning, as that’s the reason I upgraded to a new model in the first place."
201,The iPhone 11 does not allowed to activate the SIM card. We went to our telephone provider and they told us that the SIM is block. I called our telephone provider and technician  indicated that this phone is not allowing our SIM card to activate. I do not think this phone is fully unlock to use it. So I am going to return it to the seller and hope they need to fix this issue so that customers are not wasting their time and money.
202,"The speakers don’t work like they are suppose too. The battery life on the phone isn’t what is should be. The phone did come with a screen protector, which is very good! The phone should at least be checked for faults before sending out at least if your going to pay the amount your paying for just my opinion at least."
203,"Straight out of the box, the phone did not work. The seller told me I just needed to updated the phone. Jumped through hoops trying to update and reset the phone with no success.  According to Apple, the phone was over 1500 days out of warranty.  Not sure how that is possible since the iPhone 11 was released less than 2 years ago. Do not buy from this seller. It's a scam!!"
204,"UPDATE: return and refund went smoothly. New phone works perfectly, no issues!According to Apple this is a faulty device that needs to be replaced. It randomly powers down and they say it's a logic board problem that cannot be fixed. I'm hoping the seller will contact me ASAP to exchange the phone for a product that is not damaged. If so I will update my review to reflect that. This was my Mothers' Day gift. Kind of sucks that it's broken."
205,"Ok, let me start by saying I was really sketched out by ordering this. It still costs a pretty penny but you’re unable to view the quality before hand. This by no means will receive a 5 star rating from me  not because it lacks the apple packaging and accessories but because it had minor scratching on the screen. Everything Else so far has been perfect but don’t expect to get a flawless phone. a simple screen cover helped the scratch look but that’s not the point. The screens for the iPhone 11 are not oled so they are inexpensive to replace. There is no reason why based on this price tag that they couldn’t have replaced the scratch screen as well. Overall , happy with the purchase but not blown away"
206,"Phone works great and it arrived early with super fast shipping!  I was kinda bummed it came with only  89% battery life-I’m jealous of the people who got the 100% battery-but seriously-this is a great deal; my carrier tried to sell me the same phone for almost $1,200 with a contact. The one downside to the iPhone 11 (to me anyway) is that there is no headphone jack.  Love the facial recognition-wait… there’s a fingerprint reader?! I had no idea."
207,"I haven’t owned an iPhone since the first generation. I’ve been an android baby for years since then. That said, they’ve made iPhone controls way easier to learn and handle since then. I was a bit skeptical to swap over, but it’s definitely worth dropping Android for the smooth experience.This vendor shipped the phone in perfect condition, no scratches, battery life was perfect. It also arrived close to 2 days earlier than the original estimate. Very pleased with this purchase, when the time comes to grab a new phone for my wife, I know exactly where to order from."
208,"You roll the dice with every Amazon purchase and this one is no exception.  I see other reviews saying their phone was equivalent to a brand new phone, this was not my experience.  This phone has visible scuff marks around the outside of the chassis and scratches and gouges on the back panel.  The screen didn’t have any noticeable blemishes and looked to me to be a brand new screen.  I had ordered a Verizon phone but received an unlocked phone so visual voicemail will not function.  Since this was about an average Amazon experience, and returning something to Amazon is a nightmare, I’ll keep the phone.  If you go renewed keep in mind, you might be paying the same price for a blemished phone as someone payed for a near perfect phone."
209,"Right off the bat I knew something wasn’t right, the speakers weren’t loud, camera wasn’t up to par and the screen had a light spot in it all compared to my girlfriends iPhone 11. Fast forward 4 months later shortly after the return window closed for the phone it stoped working. The cellular data is locked out making it unable to do anything until I “update it” even though we fixed and update to the latest iOS. We took it to both an AT&T store and an apple store where they then informed us that it’s not even a real iPhone 11. I would not recommend buying this and don’t see how this is not illegal in some form of way."
210,Phone works great! Works with my straight talk plan. Battery life is wonderful! Super fast shipping!
211,"okay i got this phone and it came in my buildings amazon hub,, my the battery 10/10 LONG LASTING, the condition of the phone is really good no cracks, it comes with a screen protector, everything about this phone is amazing."
212,"This phone worked fine for about 3 months and then just as the warranty ended this phone started to have a lot of problems. I was only able to use the phone on speaker phone for a while so people could hear me. I have had a lot of issues with the speaker and this week the screen started to flash with lines across the phone.  I contacted the seller this was a faulty product. It has 0 water damage, hasn't been dropped and has an otter box case. They said it is out of the warranty time period and can do nothing for me."
213,"I’m overall happy. I haven’t had it for a month yet, but when receiving it, the battery was at 92% health, which is still good, for what I need. The customer service was quick to get back regarding a question I had in date of purchase. I’m not able to get Applecare since the date of purchase is not updated, but I don’t need phone insurance.There weren’t any scratches or knicks. I ordered, used like new. There isn’t any lag when using the phone. No glitches. I did have a hard time updating the phone at first. I had to start over (transferring content from my old phone) , but once I did that, and got back to the update portion, everything went smoothly. I thought I had a lemon, but it is indeed exactly what I need. For $589, used-like new, and refurbished, this is what I hoped for."
214,I got a product that goes against the guarantee written in the description of the product. It says there will be no visible imperfections when the phone is held from arms length. I could see the scratch all the way down the hallway in my home. I am attempting to get a refund and they won't reimburse me the full amount that I spent. I have yet to find out if they will charge me a fee for the return of there product that was falsely advertised.
215,This is a great product!! The phone came in a good reliable box and was here a day before it was supposed to be. I would recommend this seller 100%
216,"This was a purchase for my teenage son. He has had this phone now for about three months and loves everything about it. The camera has so many features, it’s truly incredible. The lightning fast charge really works. I wouldn’t be afraid to by renewed from Amazon. This is a great quality phone."
217,"I've always bought refurbished iphones off Amazon, so I expected this to be just as good an experience.  The first phone I bought was great for a week, then started getting glitchy.  The screen image would vibrate, and the colors would change in and out.  So sent it back and got a second.  The second phone was also great for a week.  Then it would stop responding to my finger swipes, or suddenly shift from screen to screen without my having done anything.  The not responding to my finger swipes was SO frustrating.  I couldn't even turn it off to rest it and reboot.  So I finally went directly to apple and am only paying $50 for a brand new phone.  This definitely wasn't worth the hassle."
218,"I bought this phone a few months ago and wanted to wait before writing a review.  Overall, I am very happy with it.  No glitches or bugs, minimal scratches on the back.  I recommend this seller."
219,Almost like new! It had a couple light scratches in the back and a bit deeper one on the  bottom side (not the screen but on the gold/black part) it isn’t anything to be upset about since it’ll be covered by a case and isn’t that visible unless you look for it.The phone heats up a little bit sometimes but I’ve noticed it’s when I’m holding my phone more by the middle. Works great! Make sure to update the software or the apps won’t load
220,Screen is covered in tiny scratches. Looks like it was kept in someone’s pocket constantly with keys. I can tell the phone was taken apart at some point because there are pry marks on the side of it. For $530 I should have just spent the extra $130 to buy a brand new one.
221,"So I was very skeptical only because this would be my second purchase through amazon . The first time was ordering for my mother in law and it turned out fine for her , physically flawless phone with great battery life. For me on the other hand the battery life was disappointing and I feel like the speakers are bit off like it was renewed from water damage possibly. Also the phone wasn’t all the way unlocked . Though I can use it fine and my SIM card works , for some reason it won’t fully register with my provider online and when I chatted with an agent through Verizon they said my phone was non-Verizon device and they were unable to unlock it which again begs the question is it truly unlocked? Or was there a loophole and I can still use it properly with no problem. Will be returning only because the storage is not enough in comparison to my old phone but I’ve read that it’s a hit or miss when returning these phone so wish me luck !"
222,So my phone has been working great since I bought it in May 2020. I take great care of it. I have a case on it. It hasn’t gotten wet or anything. I did the new update recently and it was fine at first but the cellular isn’t working. Apple said it was a hardware issue.
223,"Horrendous customer service and equally bad products!!! Every device (whether purchased or warranty replaced) has been defective. Verizon even told us with this last device that they did not even recognize the serial numbers for the phone).The phone worked fine for 2 months before starting to have problems. It will not send / receive data unless connected to Wi-Fi ... even with an unlimited plan and full coverage area. Yes, we are 2 werks past the refund period ... but you would certainly think this seller would try to make things right by sending a replacement (which, by the way, would be the 4th phone in a few month period). All they do is blame Amazon for their policies (instead of giving appropriate customer service).A waste of $600!!!Be wise and DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER."
224,I received my refurbished iPhone and on the screen I noticed a deep scratch so I felt it with my finger and it was smooth as there was no scratch there was a screen protector over the phone when I received it so I pulled the screen protector back and yes it is a deep scratch more of a crack than a scratch small crack I wouldn’t even care if it was on the back of the phone but on the front screen is unacceptable that’s the part that I’m actually going to be looking at and it’s annoying and it is not cheap to replace hoping to return for a different phone or return for a full exchange  or refund me partial of my money to fix the broken screen other than that Phone seems fine hooked it up use it for a day easy check out fast shipping the usual Amazon
225,"We had an issue with calls hearing them, during the 90 day period and they were awesome in getting a replacement next day after me shipping the defective one back. They respond to messages immediately and are very nice to work with! Other than that one little issue there was nothing wrong with the phone at all in perfect condition. If I order refurbished again I will definitely be going through them"
226,I am dissapointed.. i had 2 unlocked iphone 11 (excellent condition) purchased from here but both had major issues. First which i already replaced had touchscreen issue and now my second white iphone 11 has network issue which i purchased for my sister as gift. Reason i am really upset is because it took away smile from her face as soon as we found phone was defective after several tries  it still didnt show network..  I guess i have to replace second phone as well but it wont be same as the occasion is already passed..
227,"Phone arrived sooner than expected. Came in a sturdy box, new charger.  iPhone 11 - Looked like new, no scratches, no dings. Fired it up, transferred my info & apps - and off we went.  Very impressed with it. And price was very reasonable.  I will definitely buy from them again. Already recommended them to friends and family.  **pic is representative of phone I ordered**"
228,"Phone came with screen seriously scratched. It says that they have minor blemishes that are ""not visible when held at arms length."" But that is BS as this phone had pretty serious scratches on the screen. Other blemishes would be fine, but not on the screen. Will be sending back for a replacement, since they already have my money and I know it will be a pain to get a refund."
229,"Phone is defective and I’ve contacted the seller several times and have not heard back. The phone won’t stay on and is stuck in a reboot loop. My other phone is broken, hence why I ordered this one and now I have to wait to receive a refund to order another since my phone call and support requests have gone unanswered. I don’t like leaving bad reviews but I’m extremely frustrated and this hasn’t been resolved."
230,"The phone itself is nice, there are a few tiny scratches on the corner but they're not noticeable at all. I've had it for about a week and everything works fine, the battery health is at 90% and lasts for awhile between charges which is nice. I took off a couple stars because of shipping issues; for some reason my phone was unable to be delivered the 1st time and was returned to the shipper, so I had to contact the seller to send me a new one. This whole process took about 3 weeks which was super annoying, and the seller never explained why the first phone had to be sent back. Overall I would recommend buying this phone but avoiding this seller."
231,Its just like a brand new phone except:  battery potential is limited at 89% and it came with a generic box and charger.  I'm totally satisfied- the price was right.  Thank you amazon.
232,Came in time was wrapped very good It is a great phone Im enjoying it very much
233,"This phone is supposed to have no scratches visible at arms length.  Not true.  Very very visible scratches.  However it is a good phone and a glass screen protector will cover them.  Was a bit disappointed to see such visible scratches, but it was at a discount.  I guess you get what you pay for."
234,"I was hesitant about buying this but I definitely recommend! They phone came with a screen protector already on it, and a charger as well. It’s been fantastic! There were no scratches or dents. It is in really good condition and I’m super happy I made this purchase."
235,At first I was a little bit skeptical about buying this phone from a random seller but I still proceeded to purchase the phone. I'm so glad I did because the phone came in PERFECT condition. No scratches or cracks anywhere along the phone. It even came with a screen protector on the phone and even one for the back camera.
236,This was not an entirely as purchase my only issue is sometimes the screen jumps. It’s not very often but I’ve noticed or a few times. Also there is this weird thing that happens when I try to record videos with audio. There is this sound that overpowers the real time audio and it makes it difficult when recording. Other than that there were no noticeable scrapes on the phone. It came packaged well with a charger and set up was easy.
237,"Couldn't even make a phone call!  When trying to return it I kept getting stalled.  I finally decided to pay the return shipping.  Customer service was crap, phone was crap and I will never purchase from this company again!"
238,"I've purchased refurbed iPhones in the past and always have been happy with the cosmetics of the phones and the battery health.  This purchase was disappointing as there were numerous scratches on the upper right screen corner as well as what looks like small divots worn into the screen in a few places (like it constantly rubbed on something in a purse or pocket).  In addition, the battery health was at 89% (within the 80% spec Amazon has), but I've never received a phone with less than 95% life.  This is why I only rated this purchase a 3 star, however, it was delivered quickly as promised."
239,"I LOVE MY IPHONE 11!!! I bought my iphone 11 from here and i was a bit nervous, i’ve never purchased a phone outside of a phone store so i had my concerns. I read many many reviews on amazon and found this to be the best reviews. I am not disappointed! My screen is not cracked/not scratched, battery life is good, the camera is astounding and I adore the color! I highly recommend purchasing your phone from here. The only hang up I had was getting it set up with verizon, phone issues are never simple however so i kind of expected that. The customer service struggled with switching over my account to another account though, so that has nothing to do with the phone itself. Phone works great on verizon service!"
240,This item arrived earlier than expected however I am more than pleased I had no problem activating it with my carrier it came just as said! The only thing missing was the little tool to get to the Sim card but I guess if that’s The worst thing that could happen I’m OK with it. Still hoping they send me one though after reading this review
241,This is my second time buying an Iphone from Amazon sellers.  The first phone I bought was a Iphone 6 in 2017 and up to today it lasted me with no problems but I needed a new upgraded phone with a better cámara and all new features.  I decided to try this seller and purchased my Iphone 11 which didn't come in the original box but who cares the phone is working perfectly fine for the price I paid it is worth it.  Really happy with it.  Thank you.
242,Brand new phone. Great quality for the best price. Very happy with it and would recommend. I wish it came with earbuds  though.
243,"I ordered an iphone 11 and the day I activated it, I could barely hear notifications, rings, people on the phone, and it kept freezing on screens. I was trying to contact Buyspry, Marketplace, and any combination of those to get help for a return/refund of over $600, followed all instruction on the booklet provided, and there were always pieces of information missing in order to complete the return.  I'm still waiting for the return label they said was provided in a recent message but have no idea where it's provided as they stated.  They won't reply to the phone number given and are stalling until the return date is too late. Stay away from buyspry!"
244,I usually buy all my phones from this seller.But this one came with a defective microphone.However appearance and functionality was good as new.My biggest issue is my microphone won’t work at all unless I use a headset. Don’t waste your money!You won’t have full refund unless you save the box it came in. Noticed  the defect a little too late.
245,Costs the same as a new iPhone 11 shipped by apple.Came with random 3rd party charging cable and has scratches on the screen.Doesn't even look like they took the time to clean it.
246,"Haven’t noticed anything wrong with phone in 3 months so far,  battery seems brand new and camera looks good. A lot of space for cheap too. Mine started by charging really slow but I wouldn’t worry about that because the phone was probably powered off for awhile. Also I would buy a better charger this comes with a generic charger and with no phone box."
247,The product works great and everything but I checked the battery health on the iPhone and it was at 65% battery health. For a iPhone that is supposed to be refurbished they didn't replace the battery. Which means  I have to spend more money to get the battery replaced. Not happy that they didn't replace the battery. DO NOT BUY.
248,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   The phone It's fine, but I expected that it didn't have any scratches at least.Ok, i understand that is renewed, although it is true that inside the iphone is fine, face id works, camera back and front ok, icloud free, outside the screen and the back are fine, however the corners have small scratches, sometimes one expects it to arrive well cared.The battery also has 94% which is fine.The product arrived early too which is great.4 of 5 stars just for the scratches."
249,Just got my phone today and got it activated with cricket and it works perfectly the only thing is right now there is a small black shadow at the bottom of my screen that just started if in the next couple days it won't go away I will send it back but other than that I LOVE IT!!!
250,"I purchased a refurbished iPhone with my fingers crossed; however, this arrived in immaculate condition, well packaged with the charger and a little stand. I could not find a mark on it. Took it to my carrier to be added to my service and he said I got a very good deal. It even came in yellow; my favorite color."
251,"Aveces tiene un pequeno descontrol con el volumen pero despues de ahi esta perfecto, me encanta, es mi herramienta mas importante de trabajo desde casa.La carga dura mucho, no es necesario cargarlo todos los dias, con cada 2 dias esta perfecto y le doy mucho uso."
252,It was in very good condition but it is garbage it is garbage it will not sync with any of my Apple products I tried to buy AppleCare and I put in the number the serial number the The serial number and he wouldn’t even register at Apple so that makes me 🤔 Bootleg phones they’re not real Apple phones if they won’t register at Apple then what are they bootleg I have reached out to them and they refused to reach back so I guess this get their intention😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭Don’t buy
253,"The phone delivery faster than a day that Amazon estimate. The battery life is 100% very good. But the phone is very dirty in the back, especially in the camera part. And the memory has been used 11GB for something that I do not know. I do not see any headphones here but it is all right no big problem. The fully unlock that I pick for the phone is working well with the T-Mobile sim card. The charge that Amazon provides charge phone really slow to get to 100% but I already have a wireless charger so no big issue with that. All of the things that I list above about the product that I buy make me feel happy because this is a trusted place to buy the phone. But I think you should buy an iPhone 12, the same price but better color than iPhone 11."
254,"Its my second time I bought a iPhone from amazon renewed and with buyspry partner.My first time was a iPhone xs, and the cellphone was great, no one visible scratch and screen protector and battery life about 85%This time I was bought a iPhone 11, and this have 3 visible scratches in the screen and doesnt come with screen protector, but the battery is in 100%.I am little dissaponited because in the last buy, the cellphone was practically in new condition, this last one I get the impression that is not new and its used unlike the last buy (I know that no one of amazon renewed its new, but it gives the feeling of)."
255,"I sent it back, this was not the renewed quality I had expected.I’ve purchased a renewed product before and this in comparison was sloppy and looked liked I bought off of craigslist. It didn’t look trust worthy so I sent it back."
256,"I purchased the refurbished phone in August for nearly $500. On Friday, after less than 6 mos. it stopped working. The screen would not swipe. I had used it just minutes ago and it was sitting in my purse and then it no longer functioned. I tried all the recommended Apple ""fixes"", to no avail. I took it to the Apple store.Sadly, the phone is not able to be repaired unless hundreds of dollars are spent. It is NOT a software issue, it is the hardware. Something has failed and the phone is useless. Vendor was unable/unwilling to help."
257,Overall I’m very pleased with my newest purchase from this seller! I upgraded my phone from a 6s to this Unlocked 11. It made a world of difference (clearly lol). Setup and Transfer of my data/photos from my old phone to this one was painless. For those that are using Metro PCS by T Mobile  or a similar carrier save yourself some time and frustration and call customer service or login in to your personal account and ACTIVATE your unlocked device to your current account. Will definitely purchase from this seller again.
258,"My iPhone 11 stopped working just after the 90 day “replacement/repair” window ended. For $700 I expect my phone to work longer than 90 days, if you feel the same I SUGGEST YOU SHOP ELSEWHERE! PS- I did contact the seller and ask for  help to which they offered NONE."
259,"I was testing the waters to see if I wanted to switch to apple from Android. Phone came in with a few scratches on the body and the battery was at 87%, so it was in pretty good condition. Only returned it because iOS isn't my thing. Comes with a SIM tool and a 10W generic charger. I think the phone is supposed to come with 18W, but it's a good backup charger."
260,"The phone I purchased worked very well! The shop was also very accommodating and helpful. If it wasn’t for me going back to Android, I would’ve kept the phone.I unfortunately was trying iPhone after being with android for 4 years, and I couldn’t do it. It was nice to be able to test the phone with the return guarantee. Also, not sure how they’re replacing batteries,  but the battery life was so healthy on the phone. Great work!"
261,I was a little concerned to buy a phone off the internet from a 3rd party—but my good friend recommended it. i bought it for my husband and he loves it!! It’s perfect and cheaper to buy it this way with a credit card than to get one from a phone store! I definitely recommend!
262,When i reviceved this phone it looked in great shape i turned it on and i put my SIM chip in it and i got to put my apple ID in it and i couldnt use the C or the F key and then a messeage popped up about the screen being messed up because when the previous owner replaced the screen it wasn't replaced the correct way i couldnt answer calls i couldnt turn my phone off i got a refund and am sending this phone back please stay away from this seller when we tried to contact them they didnt answer or reply!!!!!!!!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM NOT ONE BIT. I paid 600 dollars for a phone that didnt work they got me thats for sure i hope they dont get anyone else!!! lesson learned thats for sure!
263,I have to say I was skeptical when purchasing this phone but I absolutely love it. It came with a screen protector already applied as well as a charger. It has no scratches to the screen or any other part of the phone also battery was at 100%. Absolutely love this phone. Thank you
264,"I purchased this phone as a gift for my dad. Right away I had trouble setting it up, When transferring all the data from his old iPhone it froze. A couple of days later the phone randomly shut off and wouldn't turn back on. The phone itself was fine physically."
265,"IPhone is in excellent physical/visual condition. However, if I pay the price that is sooo close to the Apple cost then why do I have all these problems?!! Even if the purchase is a ""risk"" (because it's renewed/refurbished) Why take so long to respond to help resolve issues?!!! This is frustrating!!! I've contacted my carrier and the phone is indeed unlocked but something on the inside is not working properly. But can't get this resolved in a reasonable amount of time because this company doesn't respond in a reasonable amount of time!!!!!!!!!"
266,It is not an IphoneIt is made in china also it is scratched
267,"I got the phone expecting I would see some evidence that it was a used phone, but, no no real sign except that it came with after market charging cable and charger. No matter, they worked great. The phones functionality was as described and everything worked. Ito be fair Ihave only had it forabouta week."
268,Camera is totally messed up. I thought these were supposed to be verified to work properly? I am returning and ordered another one. Hopefully the next one works. Check everything when you receive your phone because this obviously was not checked very well. Camera makes a static noise and shakes. Totally unusable.
269,"I’m in Jamaica and i was very skeptical about buying this phone after reading some of the reviews, I almost changed my mind. But i still went ahead and its pretty good, its in good condition (8/12/10) and it works good.. only thing I’m kinda disappointed about is that the battery % came at 79% and it has a small crack on the back at the bottom and on the side near the camera. Im mostly disappointed about the battery percentage .. but even tho its 79% it still last for a good time.."
270,"First time purchaser.I was hopeful that I would get a phone in a decent enough shape to gift, but unfortunately, the phone arrived with deep unremovable scratches on the front glass, which is a bit odd because they are supposed to be gorilla-glass quality glass. Now Im having to attempt to re-purchase in hopes to get another one in better quality in time for Christmas, I hope this process becomes more effective."
271,"I new it was a refurbished item, however I made my homework reading several reviews and the warranty from the seller.I meets all the expectations except for the bluetooth. It performs with a very poor connection with any kind of device, either audio or any other type; connection with  get's dropped once and again at a short distance, less that a meter, so even my new generation headphones I had to be replaced by the old cord headphones from my old iPhone 7.For the rest it's ok, battery, camera, speakers, processing.If you don't mind to have this kind of issues for the price, then it's a good option, but if you cannot cope with it then do not risk your money and buy a new packaged item considering to pay in full."
272,"Ordered the 11 because I needed a new phone and without a doubt this was the best price for one.Shipped pretty fast and when it arrived it didn’t come in normal Apple packaging which I expected.Phone works perfectly but main complaint I had was the battery life wasn’t at 100, not too big of a deal, another complaint was there was a screen protector put on but it was pretty poorly installed doesn’t really effect anything just a little annoying.Personally I would recommend you to buy this as the phone came in amazing basically new condition and with the price I really can’t complain."
273,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Just bought this a few days ago. I really wanted to take car of it so I bought a waterproof case even before I got the phone. So here’s the thing the phone works like new but with just 1 big flaw. Every time someone calls me and I answer the call, the screen just shuts off and I wouldn’t be able to do anything to it for a couple of minutes.it can last for at least 30 minutes. So the trick is I have to be the one to make the call that’s the way to stop it. I guess I can tolerate this but hopefully no more issues comes up."
274,"I thought I was going to be lucky. Usually I ignore reviews, DONT IGNORE! This phone was not fully unlocked and it had stated it was even in the settings. It lied, spent too much money trying to get it fixed. Not worth it at all. I am very disappointed, hope to get my money back or any sort of compensation. Don't go through the tears and trials that I did. Very upset with this product wish it was better."
275,Phone was in nice shape except for a few very light scratches on the screen. This is a known issue with the iPhone 11 so I was not surprised. The scratches are insignificant and can't be seen when the phone is being used. They are only visible when the screen is black. Shipping and communication were very good.Not an iPhone fan bought this for my wife and she likes it.
276,It’s very good. Packaging was poor but is good. Fully unlocked. It dies a hole lot quicker then the others I do say but not a big deal since there’s iPhone chargers everywhere in my house and car. The charger it came with crumbled in my hands the minute I touched it which was unusual. Very good not 5g though
277,"I had the phone for about a week and started noticing some issues with the Wi-Fi but would just reset my phone. One day the phone wouldn't let any calls or texts go through I ended up having to go to my phone carrier and see if they could help me and they got it working for a good 5-10min and the it went right back to not doing anything staying that there was no signal. I couldn't get onto any of my apps because there was no connection but when I went into the network settings, it said it was connected to the Wi-Fi. I'm very unclear about the issue but now I have to deal with sending it back to amazon and waiting to purchase the same kind through my phone carrier. I had bought an iPhone 7 off of Amazon and it works great still!"
278,"As I tried to set up this phone, I found that certain letters on the keyboard were impossible to type. The screen just doesn't respond to touch in certain spots. I was unable to set up the phone, much less use it, because you have to enter your password and I couldn't type it. I will update this review once the seller responds to my complaint, but I am very frustrated that the phone was dysfunctional. Tech Exchangee's ""customer service"" number sends you to a random voicemail box."
279,This is the 2nd time I bought a iPhone from Amazon and just as my first I couldn’t be happier! I received a day early and seriously it’s just as good as brand new out the box! It didn’t have any scratches or defects. The price was Amazing! Thanks for a great phone at a even better price!
280,"2 days after receiving my device the phones camera went black. I bought apple insurance to get it fixed, now its doing something wonky with the keyboard. I might as well have bought it new from apple for the hassle. I decided to buy based on mixed reviews but most were positive, unfortunately it didnt work out for me."
281,I love it. Ordered yesterday and it was delivered today which is one day earlier than it was suppose to come. Everything is in perfect condition and it worked with metro. I had 0 issues. Switched from iPhone 8 Plus. I was very hesitant on buying because of some of the reviews saying it wasn’t fully unlocked. but I’m glad I bought it. 🙃
282,The Best Phone I’ve Ever Owned & I’m Very Satisfied With The Day & Night Quality ❤️❤️👍🏾👍🏾
283,This product seems to work fine in the US. Someone told me my phone comes up from Mexico whenI called.  Not sure but I think that is the phone because I am using the same service that I have for years. I wish apple had left finger reader on iphone11.  The battery life is better then iphone7.Over all I am happy with this item.
284,Love the phone. It did not have a mark or flaw on it. Buy with confidence. Saved a lot of money. My only issue is that it’s not holding a charge. I upgraded from a 6 to an 11. Not one issue switching the phone from one to another. I have Straighttalk service. I am in heaven. Not missing the home button either!
285,I bought the phone refurbished and upon receipt I took it to tmobile to start service and the phone was blacklisted and reported stolen by the owner. I couldn't believe it.
286,First off the Amazon driver dropped my package from his chest on my front door and left my ring door bell caught it all. My charger plug and cord damged and dirty. My glass screen protector cracked. My phone charged all night and died 5 minutes later. Waste of money.
287,"I know this is a second hand product but honestly I expected a device without visible scratches held at an arm’s length, as the description says. When I received the phone I immediately saw there was a lot of really noticeable scratches around the bumper. It came with a screen protector which is good, but I removed it to check the screen condition and I also found some scratches, fortunately that's a good way to hide them.So far the phone is 100% functional I haven't had any trouble, it's fully unlocked as advertised and it came with the battery life at 100% which is perfect!I bought this phone from BuySPRY and I'm giving this review just 3 stars due to the noticeable scratches. Just for reference I had the opportunity to buy another refurbished iPhone from Chubbiestech in the past and they sent me a mint condition device, unfortunately this seller wasn't available when I bought the iPhone 11 but it is now. Maybe you'll have to pay a little bit more but it's definitely worth it!"
288,"I received this item today. I didn't receive retail packaging and I received an off brand charging brick and cord, I great but I could live with it. Went through all the trouble of activating the phone on my service to find out this phone gets 🔥 hot. I was making my mimoji and the phone started to heat up. This phone had on been on for 15 minutes. I had to send it back."
289,I’ve had this pastel purple iPhone 11 now for over a year and I’m still very happy with it!! I upgraded from a iPhone 7+ to the 11. I got it with 256g of memory so it holds a lot. Battery and everything else is still going strong. Very happy with this purchase
290,"So far no complaints.  However, there's much to learn and no manual included or available from Apple (which I find reprehensible). So, being an iPhone 'newbie' I had to buy a written manual.  All I can say is, to use this thing properly , it will require A LOT of further study.  It's amazing all the things this phone can do!"
291,"So far I'm pretty happy with the phone, I definitely prefer it over Android phones.  I don't have to use fingerprint reader so that's why the low review on that.  Only drawback I can't use my own ringtone/text message tones.  My boyfriend tried to and he said it was difficult.  I had to read up a little bit on how to use the phone."
292,"Although it’s a renew phone according what the headline says in the marketplace, I can say it’s a new phone. Beautiful and perfect presentation. This seller has a good service and a fast shipping option, I got my iPhone on time and hope the next one I buy would be under the same conditions both the phone and the shipping"
293,Phone has been on this software update screen for 2 hours I can’t get to any other settings because it’s still saying updating  the phone was completely dead when I got it but it’s connected to Wi-Fi and is currently charged now with 50% battery so I’m not understanding why the phone is taking so long to update I even powered the phone off and tried again still the same results I will be returning it for a full refund phone has few scratches on front screen that aren’t really noticeable I can’t get in the phone to even see how everything else works and I’m tired of waiting on the software to download so I’m powering it back off and returning it
294,It worked and all but there was a few small scratches on it and I returned it. I had no problems with the return and luckily didn't have to pay to return the phone. Its a beautiful looking phone. I give it 3 stars because it is such a good phone and the return was easy and fair. I just hope they can be more diligent making sure there are no scratches on a phone before they send it.
295,"Well to begin with, he display glass they a installed on this “Renewed” iPhone 11 was priced right , as I tried to set it up, however I discovered why… The display glass that they installed on the phone is not an Apple display there for several of the apps and a lot of the facial recognition feature don’t work and the error message just keeps flashing app on my phone it’s ridiculous I don’t recommend you by any of the renew towns from this company"
296,Got the phone was super happy but the phone won’t turn on it’s stuck on a reboot loop I tried plugging it into the computer and updating it and restoring it and nothing worked had to update it then restore it then I was able to transfer it over it still works slow
297,Mine just came in today and man am I disappointed im not even going to turn it on 4-6 massive scratches on the phone visible from more than arms length away also looks like someone intentionally scratched it how did this make it past review
298,"I was kinda hesitant on buying bc of some of the reviews, but definitely made the right choice in ordering.No scratches & minimal damage on the frame for a refurbished phone. Definitely looks new.I got it on time! Even felt like it was super fast shipping.Came with charging cable & box AND was super surprised it had a screen protector.Definitely is unlocked & had no issues connecting to my carrier. Phone seems to work perfect so far.SUPER GLAD I UPGRADED FROM MY IPHONE 7!This product is so good, I’m recommending to all that will listen lol!"
299,Paid a considerable premium with the promise of like-new quality and over 90% battery health... It was neither.
300,"Value for money-I love this phone with all my heart even though I just got it like 4 days ago it’s amazing I haven’t had trouble with it AT ALL,it was fully unlocked so the only thing I had to do was transfer my SIM card from my old phone to this phone .There is a minor problem on the front camera when taking pics and vids there’s like a faded red light while take pics ,but nobody really can see it tbh"
301,No issues with the phone. It did get here a little late but that was fault of the shipping company
302,"Bought it because my mom needed one and they were out of stock at Apple. But it came with a very scratched screen, battery only charges up to 80%. Price was way to high. I might return it if I’m able to come back home within the return period."
303,"Not gonna lie; I was sooooo skeptical about ordering a renewed phone... it took me maybe 4 or 5 days of reading EVERY review, checking ALL ratings and so on and then just basically said screw it we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it.WELL, let’s just say... the phone was PERFECT!! Not a single scratch, crack, blemish.. like seriously looks like it’s brand new. EVERYTHING works BEAUTIFULLY on this phone including the camera and I am VERY VERY impressed. The ONLY issue I do have is the batter life... it takes FOREVER TO  FREAKING CHARGE to where you see green but it’s something I willing to deal with considering I paid a good price and everything about this is damn near brand new"
304,"This product claimed that the phone was like new, and it was not at all as advertised. The phone had a very noticeable scratch on the back, which is annoying, but what really got to me is that the camera doesn't work. Whenever I open the camera to use it, the camera keeps attempting (and failing) to adjust. It vibrates the phone profusely and makes it so that I can only use the front facing camera on this phone. Absolutely not worth the price."
305,"Phone arrived today. Almost flawless. Minor scuff on one of the top corners. A little concerned that the Battery life was at 87% capacity. Other than that , it was easy to get my service switched to this device. I did it myself online. Love that it came with a screen protector already installed on the device."
306,Do not waste your money on this phone. It says internationally unlocked but it's crap. It is not reliable. One minute it works the next minute no service. The phone came with the screen chipped around the edge and it has been downstream since. The sellers are terrible.
307,"It says ""like new"" but the phone that came was heavily used, covered in scratches and could not ever pass as like new. The packaging was also covered in fingerprints and just looked really dirty. I was buying it as a birthday gift for someone but could never give this to them. I wouldn't use it myself either this is not at all worth the amount paid. I will have to return it now and will not be able to give them a birthday gift. Very upset"
308,"Got this phone for my daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it. Works great, so far no problems."
309,"First of all, it is false advertisement! I received my phone today and the phone is not unlocked! The seller needs to stop playing w/ people's money and lying because we don't have it like that to be going back and forth with this. I advise you to just get a new one."
310,"Phone works fine, light wear on the glass but still a great value compared to new. I activated it on AT&T loving it so far. It replaced my 6s so I was due to upgrade. Would recommend 10/10"
311,"Acceptable performance for the price. Heavy and clunky compared to the Pixel 3a I was using before this iPhone 11, plus the camera isn't any better than what I had with my $250 Pixel -- both shoot decent wide angle photos and video, decent processing capabilities, and both have crappy digital zoom functionality. Mostly got this for the better integration with hearing aids."
312,I was so worried about buying a phone from here (iPhone 11) . It’s for my sons birthday and I haven’t given it to him yet so I’m not sure how it’s operating but it looks nearly brand new and it’s charging to 100%. I’ll update if there’s any problems but I have a feeling all will be fine.
313,Didn’t realize that it didn’t have an EarPod hookup. Now I am waiting for a separate attachment to use for audiobooks.  Recommend including this piece of information in product description for tech challenged buyers to know at time of purchase
314,I gave this a 5/5 because the phone came in perfect shape not even a scratch on it the battery has 100% of it life and came delivered nicely.
315,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   It doesn’t have fingerprint sensor battery life is good I was having issues with the face recognition or I probably just need to reset but it’s a great phone no problems or complications since I bought it"
316,"There were 3 noticeable scratches on the back of the phone, which I don’t mind cuz I’m putting a case on. It did not come in the original apple box or come with the apple charger. The battery capacity was 90%. Other than that the screen looks like new, the face recognition and the camera works fine.It’s a refurbished phone so you get what you get. You won’t know the condition of the phone until you get it. I was looking for a relatively new phone for a cheaper price so I don’t mind with the phone I got, but if scratches and battery life are a concern for you, you might want to buy it from apple refurbished or just get a new phone."
317,I love it.
318,I dislike. I didn’t have an issue until it got stuck in a boot loop and apple tech couldn’t even fix it! 700$ wasted. Returning and getting a refund. Plus didn’t even come with a charger😡
319,"came with a screen protector & non working off brand charger. scratches on back glass & dents on buffer. recently put a new screen protector on & noticed the front  screen is completely wrecked with scratches. i bought refurbished, unlocked, 128gb, purple iphone 11. could be worse but not totally happy. i’ve bought several refurnished phone & this is definitely the worst i received. battery health good tho. works really well all in all. takes great pics. works as it should but cosmetically not worth 450$.. clean IMEI, did have to connect to a computer to properly reset."
320,"I had been looking everywhere for an unlocked iPhone 11 but they were hard to find. The refurbished price was about $800, unless I wanted to risk eBay. This was such a great deal and the phone works perfectly. It came in 4 days, was packaged carefully, and no problems at all."
321,I went to the store to get this phone set up twice and both times they said it wasn’t fully unlocked.
322,"Phone works great but it has some minor scratches and an unfortunate ding on the bottom. Not too big of a deal for a refurbished phone. But the final price of $500 is a bit high for a used phone. I only got this one due to it being a lot faster than waiting for new ones to be in stock, if they even still make them."
323,"Value for the money, it had a couple of scratches in the back but barely noticeable otherwise the phone runs good fully unlocked looks almost like new . The only complain I have about this phone is that the charger that comes with it, is not an Apple charger is just those cheap chargers you could buy at the dollar store. it does charge with it, but be ready to buy a new one soon after"
324,Didn’t come in original apple box and definitely not an apple charger. Micro scratches all over screen but barely noticeable until in light. Didn’t come with SIM card extracter but a paper clip works fine. Other than that it works great😄
325,"It’s not bad for a refurbished phone however, I would call this grade B refurbished. Most refurbished items I buy come from Walmart and I never have a problem. They always seem to be in perfect condition. It did come with a tempered glass which was a plus but when I went to put it on I immediately noticed lots of scratches on the screen. I’m assuming the screen was never replaced. The battery life is at 90% which means they don’t replace the batteries either. I’m a little disappointed with my experience because I’ve never had this happen before. I recommend if you are wanting something more “new” like because this is DEFINITELY in used condition."
326,"Phone was advertised as a renewed i-Phone 11, T-Mobile. It is in great condition, but was locked and not compatible with T-Mobile. Very disappointed in the false advertising."
327,Arrived well packaged with charger. Looked brand new--not a mark on it. Worked perfectly from the get go and a month later no issues or glitches. Teenage granddaughter is on it constantly and no complaints about battery life. Would definitely buy agsin.
328,"El celular vino como nuevo con 100% de batería, ya anteriormente había comprado un IPhone XR para mí, este es para mi pareja y vino mucho mejor que el mío, lo recomiendo completamente o simplemente tuve suerte con ambos, los celulares son desbloqueados ya que son usados en Panama donde vivo."
329,"I purchased this phone as a xmas gift for my granddaughter.  Looked great, worked etc.  This week without being dropped, wet, or anything suddenly the battery literally swelled which caused the face of the phone to fall off.  Per phone store will cost over $200 to replace.  Not happy with this.  Attempting to contact seller."
330,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Love the color , and it’s working as new ."
331,"Mine came with a glass screen protector attached, so I think I got a returned phone, but I didn’t mind. There were no scratches on the phone anywhere, so it was basically a free screen protector.Otherwise, it’s a great phone and this refurbished model works like new."
332,"Considering the number of reviews of many internet items being way off the mark regarding condition I was pleasantly surprised, when I opened the package to find the the phone, in what i consider, to be in perfect condition  - the phone is virtually unmarked with no scratches or blemishes , and everything functions as per the factory specs. I would definitely buy again from this seller and recommend to other potential buyers.For a quality item with a reasonable price and fast shipping, I would rate this transaction  A+"
333,The phone came in defected when the volume adjust itself. I put the volume up for incoming calls and it does whatever it wants sometimes it rings high other times it rings really low and other times it rings ones then turns silent.  I’m so angry cuz it was used and payed full price and it doesn’t even work correctly.
334,"Worked as advertised.  As a refurbished iPhone, you are always worried that it may not work as well as a new iPhone.  I have been pleasantly surprised with the overall condition and performance of the device.  The savings and the warranty were attractive enough for me to take the risk.  Based on my experience so far, I would do it again."
335,Pice of junk I want my money back for this pice of junk iPhone
336,after I started using in  2 weeks later the phone stop responding to touch and phone goes black while on the phone and will not respond .apple support will not fix the problem they told me the phone is out of warranty
337,"They make it seem like this will work like a brand new phone, but it seems like they just sell your someone’s old broken one wo fixing it. Dropped calls, no internet, can’t hear, alllll the things. After shelling out $600 I did not expect that from my phone."
338,Good
339,"Cons: degraded batter life (not renewed or refurbished)Pros: cosmetically perfect, in working condition, screen protector. The only factors saving it from a much harsher review."
340,"Great phone, could not tell it was refurbished, came with a screen protector on it. The only bummer is that it did not come with ear pods but I noticed Apple is no longer giving those out either, so it's all good! It turned out to $40 cheaper than a new phone, and with some Amazon credits I had I would up getting a $600 phone for about $420, go refurb!"
341,"There are a lot of scraches on the phone case, and small scraches on the screen, actually a lot, but screen is generally fine.(Only part I'm satisfied is screen)I dont care about scraches, but battery life is abslutely unacceptable.You only give me 1% battery life with 19% already lost to have to change to another battery?if 85%, 87% is worst situation but I can accept, but 81%, seriously?Since it's a gift I gave to a friend in Spain, I'm not gonna return it,but it's very disappointing the battery life, and the case also exaggeratingly scrached."
342,It one of my best purchases ever!! it came in a box and it looked like new. I couldn't find any scratches even being used. It came with a compatible charger and the key to open the sim card compartment. It works amazingly. Totally recommended!
343,"The phone's touch screen completely non-functional out of the box. There were no cracks but since the device didn't register any touch, I was never able to get past the initial setup screen (even after restarts). In their defense, they did offer a refund though unfortunately I was too busy to send it in time. I'm not saying all of their phones come broken but I figure it's worth mentioning that mine was."
344,Product came in earlier than expected. These iPhones are good as new and I recommend these to anyone looking to purchase an iPhone. I bought 1 for myself and another for my girlfriend and they were both beautiful and in perfect condition. I was also pleased to see that both came with a screen protector installed. I am very satisfied with this product and I suggest this product to anybody looking to get a basically brand new iPhone for a better price.
345,"La verdad que al ser un telefono renovado pude recuperar toda la informacion de otro iphone lo que es genial aun no puedo hablar de la bateria lo estoy cargando, venia cin algunos raspones pero con una proteccion no se notaran, por el momento estoy feliz, dire algo mas cuando lo prube mas dias  funciona muy bien en chile"
346,Phone as described I definitely recommend this product no noticeable dents or scratches on the screen. Does show wear but only when closely inspected not just from looking at the phone. So far it’s good this is my first day using the device so if anything changes I’ll update my review.
347,"The first phone i received looks great, but had countless issues. The ""i"" key wouldnt work, the phone wouldnt charge intermittently, the screen would freeze every few hours. Very annoying issues. Decided to get a replacement and the shipment has been delayed 3x now. Will be sending this one back and be out of a phone for at least a week. Will report back when I get the replacement. My family has bought refurbished phones multiple times with no issue, but I had to write an honest review so far."
348,This phone crashes multiple times a day. I’ve had it for less than a year and it’s already severely malfunctioning. It needs to be rebooted multiple times a day for it to even make a call. Definitely a bad product sold by the seller.
349,At first I was hesitant to buy an iPhone over the Internet but to my amazement this is one of the best purchases I’ve ever made.  Phone looks brand new no scratches no dents everything works flawlessly.  I bought the iPhone 11 in purple and I can’t believe all the things it does compared to my iPhone 7.  Stop searching you’ve found your new iPhone from this company!!
350,"Great value, screen sometimes doesn’t want to operate like it freezes up sometimes and I have to close out of the app I was in or sometimes it’s slow a little but I can live with it. Everything is in perfect working order and screen is in great condition came with a screen protector. Awesome phone, wish the battery life was a little longer though, last maybe two-three hours using it. Checking my phone and going on every now and then last about ten hours, so not too bad."
351,"I've had the phone for about 16 hours.  Nothing but trouble right from the start.  It keeps restarting itself and shutting the screen off randomly.  I spent over an hour troubleshooting with Apple. They said that it's probably bad software.  I'm sure iPhone 11s are great, just don't waste your money buying it from Amazon.  Buy refurbished directly from Apple.  That way you have options if it doesn't work (other than wasting your time returning it.)"
352,I love my new iphone! The video quality is so good and there are so many accessories that i can get to go with it. People can't believe i shoot all my IG content on this phone or how fast I produce the content. Between the audio accessories I bought and music features on garageband I shoot and edit right in Imovie which has green screen features now and export so quickly. I even shot a music video in my GARAGE that no one believed was actually my garage because Imovie did such a dope job with it's green screen. Highly recommend especially for this refurbished price.
353,Overall the phone is nice but little things like me constantly getting notifications because the screen was repaired not at an apple facility or my AirPods breaking up and disconnecting constantly (when they are new and it worked just fine on my old phone) those things annoy me anything else is fine
354,THIS PHONE IS LOCKED !!!!!! do not buy from this person i’m not satisfied
355,AT&T turned off my service because phone reported stolen. Now wife had to go back to her old phone. I have to go to buy new phone now. Can’t believe Amazon sell stolen property.
356,I was skeptical getting the phone but for the price it works perfectly it does everything an apple product is supposed to. Now it didn’t come in the original packaging which I didn’t mind. And the charging cable is long which I find a bonus. Overall I love it
357,"The best phone for the BEST price, BuySpry really did it again. Second time buying from them and honestly they did not disappoint. Battery life is at 100% health, screen, body of the phone are completely unharmed as if I had just bought it straight from apple. Also, it even came with tempered glass already on the screen which is an added plus!! I'm so so happy I purchased my phone here."
358,"Bought this unlocked iPhone with skepticism after reading the reviews. The phone looks like brand new, no scratches. Bought a SIM card from my phone carrier and so far has met my expectations. I only charge it once a day which is great, compared to the other iPhones I had. Purple color is beautiful, looks more like lavender. Amazon customer tech support was very helpful and even connected me with Apple support to obtain help with the data transfer from my old phone. A great buy at a reasonable price!"
359,"I was hesitant to get a ""renewed"" phone, but it has worked just as well as advertised.  I'm very happy with it and would renewed again."
360,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   It’s a good phone but the reason why I give it 4 stars is because I had to unlocked the FaceTime and imessages ( from turning green ) on. If have any of those difficulties please contact apple right away and they’ll help you. You’ll thank me in the future. 💯if you notice , the purple phone always tends to work better than the other colors phone by looking at these reviews."
361,Llego pronto.en buenas condiciones
362,"This phone appears to work well, but I was quite disappointed by the appearance. The screen and phone case are very scratched up. If I didn't need a phone immediately I would have sent it back. REally expected a nicer looking phone."
363,"I chose this seller because of 100% positive feedback but my phone is not compatible with the carrier it was sold as being exclusively for. When I tried to activate the phone I found out it is incompatible with my AT&T SIM card. I spent 2 hours on chat with support but they were just talking in circles and I was never convinced they even understood the problem. If someone pays almost $500 for an item, it should be as described. Further, there was extensive cosmetic damage. I honestly would've overlooked the damage if the phone had actually worked."
364,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I knew it was a shot in the dark ordering. When phone arrived. Looked okay. Had lots of scratches and the back camera was chipped. When trying to set up the phone, would not update to the latest IOS. Would not let you skip around. Gave option to return in exchange for new phone. Hope that one is functioning."
365,My husband is not very techie.  He only wants a phone that works and did not want to pay a high price for a new IPhone.  The warranty is good on this and he is just fine with a refurbished one.
366,"Fast shipping works just like new no scratches or anything in particular so far so good,I recently bought (2) from different sellers and I had to send it back within days.,fingers cross I would recommend it to anyone who has problems like me in the past with others sellers this renewed are basically new ones 👍"
367,"When I was looking for a new phone, I didn’t care that it was renewed. I’ve never had problems with renewed phones. So I came here first. I saw so many misleading things about these phones. But I made the purchase anyway. The phone came with 97% battery life, no scratches, no dents, and it was completely unlocked. Basically brand new. And I LOVE IT. I nervously waited for the package. And when i finally got it and everything was perfectly fine with it. I was amazed. So many people had said, so many misleading things. But truth is? IT AMAZING. GO FOR IT!"
368,My phone arrived earlier than expected.  I am almost 82 and I was able ON MY OWN set up the new phone and transfer all the data from my older phone to the new.  I'm very happy with my Iphone 11
369,I wasn’t sure that I wanted to change phones but this iphone11 is a dream. I didn’t realize how good it would be and I am now an iPhone lover. The seller was super.
370,My Face ID didn’t work. My front portrait mode doesn’t work They offered to replace but I would have had to send the whole phone back in order to replace which would’ve left me with no phone until they decided rather on rather not they would fix/replace it . So sad such a bummer not having Face ID
371,I know it was a renewed phone but for the money you still expect a decent phone. This one was full with small scratches on the back and even two bigger ones in the front…I sent it back immediately…
372,"I bought the phone for my 16yr old daughter she loves the phone, we ask for yellow they ran out, but he made sure to call me and ask what else color so my daughter pick green, it’s cute minor scratches but nothing serious. It’s fully unlocked and works perfectly.. this is the 3rd One I have purchase through this seller never disappointed."
373,"96% battery. no scratches on the screen, side or back. Face ID works well and camera is perfect. The phone came in 4 days. It also came with a charger and charger box. 3months later and my phone is still working fine, will update at 6 months."
374,"Had to immediately have battery replaced and now have to go get whole thing fixed as it keeps just shutting off.  Amazon is reimbursing for charges to get it fixed, but what a pain! I use my phone for work and this has been a big hassle.  Very disappointed"
375,"Purchased this phone for relative who was leaving the country and needed an unlocked phone while traveling overseas. It was shipped fast, arrived on time but was very disappointing  to see very clear signs of wear and tear. The phone had scratches everywhere, which you would expect since it wasn’t new but a huge scratch on the top right side of the screen was shocking. The phone actually looked like it had been abused. I wanted to return it but couldn’t because the person whom it was for had to leave the country the next day."
376,"When I got the the phone i was able to put my iCloud on and everything else but when I put in a SIM card it would not read my data, took it to the T-Mobile store and the IMEI on the phone was locked meaning the person who had it before did not pay off the phone and the provider locked the IMEI and the phone can only be used on wifi."
377,I was realllllyyyy scared to purchase a phone off of Amazon at first. I had it in my cart for days but I’m glad I decided to go ahead and purchase this. I’ve been having the phone for over 6 months and have had 0 problems. I was able to activate it with my phone provider with no issues as well. No regrets at all.
378,phone was great com card would fit in com card tray had to return so far have not received A refund Will not re-order until I receive a refund the phone itself looked great but was of no value if you cannot use it as a telephone patiently waiting for a refund
379,"Perfect product! I was a little worried when first buying this product due to it being refurbished but it works great just like brand new! Not one scratch or mark and if your has one on it, it possibly could have came from the delivery truck or processor rather than the manufacturer. I’m very pleased with this purchase and I would recommend this product to anyone who does not want to spend 1,000 just on a phone."
380,"Do not buy, this phone is a junk.Mine arrived with a bad screen installed."
381,"I don’t really know why,  but when my IPhone 7 Plus started giving me trouble and I needed a new phone, I let someone talk me into trying an android. 2 weeks later I returned the android. I love my IPhones too much! This IPhone 11 is so nice. I absolutely love the face recognition. I bought the yellow and it is so pretty. The size is perfect!"
382,"You Might be skeptical of getting a renewed phone, but so far mine has had no noticeable issues or differences from a brand new one. Even physically, it was flawless; no scratches on the screen or dents or anythin. As far as I’m concerned, I basically got a new IPhone for 100 dollars off so I’m pretty happy with it."
383,"I can not coment on the actual performance, except to say that If you are an Apple user this is a good choice. My friend did not like the xr. This one has huge storage capacity, retina display, and there are plenty of accessory items available."
384,I have yet to be disappointed with this phone!!! Yes... took me a minute to get used to the phone/screen size comparing an iPhone 7 but hands down... Good job Apple and good job Amazon for a clean... refurbished product that works so flush 👌🏼The data transfer via Cloud was super fast and easy. Probably the best I’ve dealt with yet.Screen resolution... keyboard tranquility... overall battery & performance?? Forget about it... because this device has it all !!!!
385,"Super skeptical after the 1 star reviews, but hey 90 Amazon money back I figure what the heck. Great product basically new batter capacity is 100% no problems with the phone. I got a t mobile specific phone swapped the sim and off I went. Nice product"
386,"Phone arrived quickly, it looked brand new. It even had a screen protector and AppleCare for the next 6 months which we didn’t know we were getting either. Also, the charger it came with looks to be a fast charger and it does charge the phone super fast. The only con is that the battery life is already at 86, but that is expected considering it’s refurbished. We were a little hesitant considering there wasn’t too many reviews, but so far we are extremely happy with the product. We will buy from seller again in the future."
387,"I recommend to anyone who is going to invest their money in this not to buy it, they are not supposed to sell damaged things, buy one of these and it would turn on and off by itself, so it is useless to sell something damaged"
388,"I ordered this phone because I was due for a new one, and I needed more storage space. I came across this one and I thought it was a great deal but was nervous about it being renewed. I read all the reviews and the only doubts I had was when the battery life wasn’t at 100%, with the phone being renewed, it states very clearly that it wouldn’t come in the original Apple box or the Apple charger and cube. So when the reviews were bad about that, it was clear they didn’t read the complete description. I went ahead and purchased and was very pleased with it! The phone came with 100% battery life, the screen was perfect, and I was overall very pleased! I highly recommend this phone and company!"
389,"It was working fine battery life was more than anticipated at 96 instead of the advertised 85-90 I believe, but after about 40 days the phone would restart like it had no battery left even though it was at 100% or while it was charging. Everything else was fine and id probably still buy another phone from the company."
390,"Decided to go the refurbished route after buying new phones up to this point. I am very pleased with the phone (iPhone 11 128gb). It looks and performs like a new phone, for a significant savings. The battery health is at 85%, but that is more than enough to last a full day and then some."
391,"The phone arrived ahead of schedule, but it was immediately and clearly obvious that one of the rear camera lenses was cracked in multiple places (which was helpfully covered by a gross dirt-streaked sticker). The seller's ""certified"" / ""renewed"" product label is dubious, at best. Here's to hoping that their returns process works better than the eyesight of whoever ""certifies"" their phones..."
392,"Phone came on good started up fine after a few hours of usage the entire screen had horizontal lines and battery life was on 87 percent on it, didn’t fall or anything like that lines just appeared don’t waste your time buying this phone very bad service"
393,"I just messaged the seller, and hoping to hear from them soon.The phone came super quick, which is amazing. I was able to figure out how to transfer my info super fast and I was happy to be saving money and causing less damage to the planet. However, the camera must be damaged as it takes pictures with a dark spot in the picture. And now the keyboard is lagging. I hope they are able to work with me to either send me another one or fix this one."
394,the entire phone it was broke and was scratched up bad when i got it
395,"I just received this phone today for my daughter and their are no scratches and everything went smoothly with transferring her old phone to that one but 3 hours later it started glitching. I tried to turn it off but it wouldn’t even do that. We tried for about 10 minutes then just gave up. When came back to it about 3 minutes later, it was fine. So I will be keeping a eye on it and let you know the updates tomorrow"
396,"In good condition. No scratches, came with a screen protector.The only problem is that it has turned off a couple of times when I least expect it after having it less than a month, it turns right back on, but it is a major inconvenience. I had to find a repair shop near me to fix it. Since I use my phone for work, I cannot be without one. I contacted the seller and was only refunded $20 (I kept the phone for my work)I recommend that if you do get a used phone, to double-check everything before getting rid of your old one."
397,Excuse my nails lol but it works good as you can tell im using it I had the xs and been wanting the 11 it is a tiny bit bigger I love the color. Not a scratch nor nothing on here nor dirty I would say it’s straight out the original box im satisfied with my purchase and the switch to metro was easy
398,"I ordered the iPhone 11 64 gb tied to my carrier which is AT&T. I’m honestly shocked at what great condition the phone is in locks practically new no scuffs or scratches on the screen or anywhere on the body of the phone. I just popped my SIM card out of my old phone and into this one everything seems to be In working order. Very happy with the purchase face recognition works great, camera’s work great, battery life solid. I was pleasantly surprised."
399,We thought it worked cause it turned on and we transferred data. It gets hot and turns off completely during calls or texting and also when I’m not even using it I can see it turn on and off. Setup the facial recognition but since it turns off so much it always needs the manual code. Definitely requesting a return.
400,"As always, I was a bit skeptical about ordering a $800 phone off amazon but I’m so glad I did. It even came with a screen protector and it came brand new, only a tiny scratch on the screen protector but other then that the phone was spotless. So happy with what I got and happy it saved me a couple $100. The phone also came unlocked and had no trouble switching it over to my network. 10/10!"
401,The accessory came with this phone is very cheap made in China type.Also the box.. I don't recommend this at all.
402,I won hundred percent absolutely love my phone it came with a good battery no nicks no dings no scratches just a perfect phone camera is great have no issues with my phone delivery was smooth transfer was smooth absolutely would buy another phone from this company
403,Ordered this phone for my mom. Shes replacing an iphone 6s.  Transferred everything over bluetooth in minutes. Had the phone up and running in less than 10 minutes. Phone came clean and polished. No scratches or defects. Battery was charged at 65%.  Inserted the Mint Mobile sim card and within seconds we could receive texts and calls. Everything works perfect
404,I was skeptical to order a phone from Amazon but I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered Prime and it arrived even earlier than it said. The phone looked absolutely brand new with one very minor scratch you can only see if you examine really close. I would buy again. Came with 90% battery health
405,Do not buy.There is a three month warranty which ended three days ago and now the phone stopped working.It didn't last!It's a dud!
406,Screen had black spot lower right corner. SIM card port didn’t work verified by apple support. Apple support was the one who urged me to get a refund or exchange. 70 dollars more for a brand new iPhone will save you a lot of headache.
407,Everything on the outside of this phone was just okay until I switched it ON and used it for a couple hours. This cellphone couldn't stay ON for longer than 30 minutes and kept restarting/booting itself repeatedly. The operating system was stuck on the oldest version and refused to accept any updates. Complete LEMON! Avoid this seller at all costs!
408,I’ve had this phone for 3months and it has started to glitch and freeze. Buy the warranty package. I purchased another phone with the warranty protection package and I forgot to add the warranty to this phone as well. :(((( the phone works well enough just a minor annoyance.
409,Wife loves this phone and me too. The only phone I like better is s20ultra. She got red and the finish is beautiful. Call quality stood out from previous phones as it is exceptionally loud n clear. Sounds like the people you're talking to are right in front of you
410,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I really liked the packaging that the phone came in. Everything was wrapped, and sealed neatly. I would honestly get as much gigabytes as possible so your phone has enough space, and storage. I wasn’t sure if I should buy this phone because it is amazon renewed, but they did a great job. Battery life was perfect, screen and all is functional. Make sure you have a SIM card for the phone. The value is kind of expensive but it’s worth it, also the phone is fully unlocked and that is very important!. Thank you!"
411,"For the price, I expected the battery life to be better than 91%. Very disappointing and I feel like I was ripped off. Plus the charging brick and cord don’t match."
412,When activating the device with AT&T we found that the device had been reported lost/stolenThis device is now a brick
413,"If I didn’t know any differently I would have thought this was a brand new phone. Beautiful condition, completely full battery life.very happy with this purchase."
414,"Even though this was a refurbished phone it still looked like new. Works great and came with a 100% battery which was a biggie for us. Came with aftermarket accessories, but that's what the listing said it would have.  We are happy with our purchase."
415,The zero does not work
416,"I’ve had for about a month now and no complaints! Works like new and arrived with no scratches, dents or problems!"
417,"Love the phone, brand new conditions, I didn’t see any problems. Great battery life. Like I can be on 1% and still use my phone no problems. Came quickly. I bought the unlocked version and I have T-Mobile. I’ve had the phone for about a month no issues. T-Mobile was able to easily connect it with my old number. My only issue is that my google accounts keep asking me for my password. Not sure if that’s a phone issue or a gmail issue."
418,"Battery life was at 90% but, expected. Device is two years old. It looks flawless. No damage whatsoever. Renewed is the way to go. Save money and get a fully working device."
419,First one we got kept turning off. Return was painless but having to transfer data from old phone to new phone TWICE was a little inconvenient. Now satisfied.
420,"sin duda alguna ha sido una de las mejores compras que hecho Celular vino muy bien empaquetado traía un cargador y cubo para cargar muy bueno La condición de la batería es excelente yo creí que iba ser menos por ser reacondicionado pero tiene un 95% de batería  Y en la parte física del teléfono lo veo muy bien están muy bonitos tal vez tiene unos pequeños raspones y Rayones en la pantalla pero son casi nulos ,  Y si funcionó el desbloqueo de la banda así que sólo puedo decir que es la mejor compra que he hecho y que recomiendo mucho al comprador buyspring"
421,I took my new phone to the phone store to have my information transferred from  my old apple 6 plus...bought a screen protector and case for it...When the clerk was putting on the screen cover he noticed some scratches on the screen.. Very disappointing... He was almost done.. I have kept the phone because of all the time and effort and added expense..  MISS not having a button on the bottom... Wish one would receive a booklet when you make a purchase like this..
422,"I went from an IPhone6 to this phone.  After the culture/adjustment shock, I am loving it.  Ii received it  promptly and it was even better than described"
423,"I wouldnt pay more than $100 for this thing. They've obviously done a terrible job fixing whatever issue this phone had in the refurbishing process. The thing is so slow it crashes when scrolling through simple apps like Twitter or Instagram. Need to back up your photos? Forget it, impossible on this thing. Quite literally unusable for anything but calls. Absolute waste of money. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SELLER."
424,I have not had any problems whatsoever. There was not a single mark in this phone it looked brand new. So far it’s working fine
425,"Obvious scratch on camera. Not full unlocked, original carrier’s information inside and can not be deleted"
426,Bluetooth doesn’t work on the phone at all when I messaged the seller.  They did nothing to fix it.
427,Love the color and the phone is almost like new.  I ordered an XR before this and was not satisfied with its feature. Easy return and was able to purchase this one. Great quality.  Great battery life.  Great camera.
428,When i received the Verizon 64 gigabyte version it could not be activated because it was a fraudulent device.
429,So far so good! I needed to upgrade my phone for awhile and postponed. This was such a. Great deal on a refurbished phone. A 36 month contract with a phone carrier to get a similar phone would have cost me double.
430,"I ordered my phone on wednesday and it came on friday. i love it. i set it up checked all the important things like system speed, speakers, flashlight, front and back camera and i even airdropped a picture to see how fast it would download, it works perfectly fine for now, i’ll try to update if anything happens. it doesn’t have any cracks or scratches. i would definitely recommend. i read the reviews and i was kinda scared but it turned out just fine. and i’ll also try to update with results of battery life."
431,Face recognition is not my favorite security. I need to take my glasses off to read my phone. Face recognition has me with glasses so I usually have use pin # anyway
432,I must say I’m quite impressed with this phone it looks brand new and works great very satisfied so far gonna keep using it of course and hopefully I won’t need to update this so far I’m quite impressed
433,Second time buying from this seller.Both times amazing!!!Thank you sooo much
434,"Shipped quickly, arrived in great condition with a screen protector already installed. Everything transferred from old phone and and all features work correctly. Battery life is 100% , this is the 2nd one I’ve ordered and both are still working perfectly!"
435,"The phone came in great condition. The only dent or scratch was on the screen and it’s nail thin and very hard to even spot. The battery health is 81% which is definitely on the lower end, but the battery last a good amount of time before I have to recharge the phone. I would recommend others to purchase as well."
436,This is the second one of these that I bought best price just like a new phone battery is 100% everything works on this phone we’re really happy with them
437,"We were worried but honestly it is so working GREAT. Even the transfer of all our apps, Contacts, Notes, etc were VERY easy to transfer.So far so good."
438,"I’ll admit I was very skeptical about buying a phone off Amazon, but as soon as I got the phone I was very impressed and super happy. It came two days after I purchased it which was amazing, it’s in perfect condition no cracks or scratches. Battery life is excellent and came with the charger and charging box, as well as a screen protector. I got the case separately. It Was supper easy to set up and is overall the best thing I have purchased on Amazon."
439,"I bought this and used it for about two years and recently gifted it to my daughter. It doesn’t act used, even after I used it. Battery life stays long as long as you don’t use with while charging but that’s any phone."
440,I only bought this because it was advertised as fully unlocked. Come to find out that it’s still locked to the previous carrier and now I have to spend more to unlock it so I can connect the phone.
441,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   The touch not working ...."
442,Phone did not work and started glitching immediately then froze. Was a bday present for my daughter. Thankfully Amazon let us return for full refund. Buyer beware!
443,"The main reason I was upgrading my phone was for the nicer camera. Unfortunately the camera wouldn't focus and made a loud clicking noise whenever the camera app was open. Returned, and hoping to have better luck next time"
444,"So I was very skeptic , I never had bought a phone from amazon, but seriously loved it, I got the phone in a usps box with charger, but the phone is like new, so far it’s been 5 days and the phone is just working fine, so happy for the purchase looking forward on getting pro for my sister from them next month"
445,"I bought this phone less than a year ago and it mysteriously stopped working for no reason! Even the Verizon guy was perplexed. If you just want a phone for a short time, go for it, otherwise look elsewhere."
446,I had the iphone 7 that started to show signs of failure. I wanted a bigger screen and an upgraded camera but didn't want to pay the $1000 plus dollars for it. I found this phone and pulled the trigger. I'm always worried about possible issues when spending this kind of money. I'm happy to say the phone is working great after 4 months. The camera is fantastic and shots with low light is no longer a problem. I use the phone with strava so it gets good use while I'm cycling. I'll buy another iphone from this seller when the time comes.
447,"The phone is almost brand new! Battery health up to 91%, only a few ( around 4 tiny specks) scratches, unlocked (im in latinamerica), with working faceID, speakers etc. AMAZING purchase!"
448,"I bought this for my husband’s birthday in August. He loves it, the phone works just as good as mine that I paid double the price for. It was a good buy"
449,"This phone was not having a great battery life as expected or reviewed others, maybe renewed compromise. Display was not that great, had some wear and tear. But features of Iphone 11 are all functional. Had to return but its almost more than 2 weeks, I have not received  the refund of it."
450,Did not have the battery renewed was below 90%. Everything else was fine.
451,"My biggest disappointment was the battery life. It came at 86% and by the time I downloaded the IOS 15 update it went down to 81% 👎 Was hard for the phone to keep charge after that. Cosmeticaly the phone didnt't have scratches or dents but it could have been cleaner, such as the ear piece and speakers. I tired to clean it but wasn't so successful. Thought the seller I choose would have been a better purchase for me as they had so much 5 stars...guess not"
452,Phone stopped working after 2 days of use. Took to Apple Store and was basically told it wasn’t even an iPhone. It has android phone parts on the inside.
453,I bought this to replace one my daughter had at college. The price was excellent and the features are good. It was easy to go to Verizon and have it set up.
454,Screen broke (not cracked~shakes and is unusable and is not due to use) literally less than a month after the 90 day warranty. Don't buy!
455,Received a dead phone. Won’t even charge. Returned and looking elsewhere
456,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Ni parece nuevo ni funciona como nuevo. El equipo estaba muy sucio en las bocinas de audio  y en el pin de carga, aparte estaba completamente maltratado!! Golpeado y rayado de tal manera que se ve cómo perdió la pintura. De batería un 80%"
457,The phone works great! It was fully unlocked. I have had no trouble setting it up. I highly recommend. The price is great for the phone. It works like n new phone. The Face ID works great. There was no starches. It is is good shape. The batter life was at 86. Which is great for a used phone. The shipping was packed very well. It came with a charger & a screen protector. It also came with a thing to take your sims card out which is great.
458,I’m IN LOVE with this phone and the fact that it’s like brand new and unlocked just made it better for me. Seriously it was like buying a brand spanking new iPhone for a much lower price. The camera quality is why I wanted this phone to begin with but everything else just makes the phone so great. I’m very happy!
459,"The phone was amazing honestly, it came early and was very easy to setup. Battery life isn’t all the way full but it’s ok, it came with a screen protector on it with a couple of scratches wasn’t visible at first but it’s ok again. Had no possible issues so far and hoping for the rest of time until I have a new phone! Was very nervous of buying at first but glad I did it! Went from iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone 11 glad for the upgrade."
460,Llegó perfecto un familiar pidió un iPhone X en otro lugar y no le llegó bien no le encendía por lo que me dio miedo pedir en Amazon pero me decidí arriesgar y si que valió la pena me llegó perfecto y sin ni un rasguño encendió y todo mi único inconveniente es la batería que está en el 89 número que no es malo pero esperaba que fuese mayor ya que a algunos les llegó al 100 pero dejando eso de lado está perfecto muy recomendable.
461,Oh well.The phone works great.  no problems.  would have preferred to get brand new....  Pd $700...  if I'd only known then What I know now...  July 9 - Sept. 9.....  2 months and I could've gotten brand new from my cellular provider for $590
462,"I was kind of skeptical at first to buy it, I know amazon it’s quality, but read some experiences that went wrong and I was scared it was going to be the same for me, but I took the chance and I have 0 regrets. I got the phone in nearly mint condition, I cannot see any scratches, the battery is at 100% and the face ID works just fine. Have been with my new phone for 2 weeks and everything works perfect. I love it and I loved the price and it came with a screen protector installed and all. 100% worth my money, helping the planet and saving some money."
463,"My boyfriend just bought me this phone as a late anniversary gift since he knew I had been wanting one, it came unlocked as it was stated. I wish it didn’t have little bits of scratches in the corners shown in the pictures but once I put a case on it won’t matter. I also would of liked the battery life to be 100% but again, I’m just glad it looks as good as it does and I appreciate that it even already had a screen protector on it. And it came super fast! Thanks so much (:"
464,Amazing find for a present! The person loved their gift and got it for a great price. Easy to transfer info onto new phone and everything runs smoothly! Thanks
465,Got this for one of our spawns who is incredibly rough on electronics.  Everything worked great and it’s been over a month- no issues.
466,"la bateria estaba gastada y no fue informado, no se envio el cargador original y tampoco el cable original"
467,"Well I wasn't going to write a review but hopefully it'll help someone in the future...I bought this phone for my son and took it to our carrier who informed me that this phone wasn't unlocked and had 2 MEI numbers we even called Apple who then informed us that the phone would only work overseas. I returned it without a problem and received a full refund, which I'm very thankful for because this phone wasn't cheap and it kept powering on and off by itself which was unusual."
468,"El dispositivo llego en una caja de restauracion de amazon, tiene todas las funciones perfectas y estaba liberado para ser usado con cualquiera telefonica a nivel mundial recomiendo comprar estos dispositivos restaurados por amazon."
469,"For the price it would cost to fix the screen, I could get a brand new phone… no thanks.Disappointed because I’ve bought refurbished phones from Amazon before and had a great experience. Sadly, this was a waste of time and money. Returning"
470,This item wasn't new it came with scratches.please do not buy.
471,It was exactly as described.  Should have paid attention to the memory amount but that was my own fault. Love the red.  And the camera is outstanding
472,"A good product for value. I found other phones that were $30-$60 cheaper, and this phone did come with some slight cosmetic problems on the body. But overall I chose to go with this product due to 1)it coming with accessories, 2) it had the option of getting a protection warranty, and 3) it being an Amazon trusted item with the ability to return.Battery life is at 91% capacity which is good."
473,I was very hesitant due to “it’s too good to be true” old saying. But honestly it works like new with a minor set back. Siri doesn’t respond to voice so me saying “ HEY SIRI” doesn’t do much. Weirdly enough it does activate randomly to loud coughs. Which is strange but this is an on off deal. I really enjoy it. Besides the Siri dearer there’s a chip of paint near the bottom lens that would frustrate someone with OCD. Overall good buy. I lucked out.
474,"Llego en muy buenas condiciones, solo un detalle en la esquina un rasponcito y un ligero arañaso en la pantalla pero que ni se nota, ademas la bateria llego con el 96%. Recomiendo este vendedor"
475,This phone was order came today and can you believe the phone doesn't even turn on what type a business is this crazy. I placed it on charge still nothing rubbish. I'm returning this and I need my money back. Everyone please don't purchase EVER from this seller
476,The only the thing I didn’t like is the charger it came with I’m going to be honest that charger I could have gone without it it takes so long to charge the phone but otherwise everything was smooth
477,"The product arrived a day early. Nice. The phone was in excellent condition, no scratches on phone nor screen. Fully charged, I went to ATT and got a SIM card, took minutes and free. Since I lost my phone and did not backup, my fault, I had to download apps and do my own email stuff.  The phone is nice with works well.  Very happy, only had it one day, but we are off to a great start!"
478,"Over all excellent condition battery life was 85% which is is still decent, return policy is great if there are any issues"
479,Pro’s about the purchase: Phone arrived a day earlier than expected and was in excellent condition and even had a screen protector on the screen so that was a plusCons about the purchase: The phone had a bad SIM card reader in it and would not read my SIM card even after taking to AT&T for a new Sim so I had to take it to a repair shop and pay an additional $80 for a repair in order for my SIM card to work
480,I have to be up front and say I wasn’t sure about this at first. It was a lot of money to pay. Considering it’s my first iPhone coming from android. I got the iPhone 11 fully unlocked in black and it was super easy to get activated. A fast charger came with it no headphones but I use truly wireless earbuds so I’m good. My final verdict is buy the phone it will be a great investment. My experience has been so great my woman wanted one so we’re currently waiting for it to come in the mail.
481,"I bought this phone about a year ago, immediately i noticed that it was garbage. the screen on the phone would bug out and start making calls, pressing buttons, swiping, tapping on everything by itself. i took it to the shop and they told me the phone had already been fixed multiple times by someone else. i understand it was used, but it said “like new” when i bought it. i had to throw it out within weeks."
482,It’s nice and I definitely understand it was used but you literally could have said the microphone is some how clogged up and people barely hear me and it didn’t even come with headphones I might return it I don’t know but hey I phone 11 woo hoo..
483,This was a great value for us. On our iPhone 7 it used the fingerprint the iPhone 11 uses face Recognition I love it!! Also no home button. You just swipe so much easier!! I actually bought two of them one red and one black fir my husband. They both look and act like new phones. Only way to go!!
484,The device came in an original box and was in great (like-new) condition. No scrathches at all. The charger is off-brand and charges a bit slow. Get yourself an OEM charger or something more powerful if you don't have one already.
485,The regular iPhone 11 is small for me. Therefore I returned it. I am a former Android owner so using a iPhone is way different.  Went back to ads and Android.
486,"Overall i would be inclined to give this item a higher rating as the phone itself was in great condition, however upon arrival the phones microphone did not work at all...a message was sent to seller with no response at all, only an approval for a refund...item was returned immediately and waiting on refund...I would have just asked for an exchange (less hassle) however due to sellers silence I will just get a refund and shop somewhere else I guess..."
487,"My son has had this phone for several days now and hasn't had to charge it yet, and he's so incredibly happy with it's photography capabilities compared to his previous iPhone"
488,Muchas gracias me gustó la cámara está de exelente👍😁
489,So far I can’t make it work.  I have been unable to make a single phone call.Why would they get rid the handy home button and replace it the awkward bar?
490,It has some issue with volume and when I put the speaker mode in a call the sound quality is bad . It shows signs that it was opened and screwed back in at the bottom of the phone where the speakers are. I ended up buying headphones to be able to use it. I put volume on maximum to have a disent sound. I understand that it is a renewed model but for the price i paid i was expecting a much better quality . Battery life is very good
491,"i assumed the phone was gonna be crappy because i didn’t fully trust the fact it i was being ordered from amazon but i stand corrected. the phone came perfect no scratches nor defects, battery last awhile, and the face recognition works how it would on any other phone. the phone isn’t slow or hard to use, it really is amazing! if you’re thinking about buying from this seller please do so :D"
492,"Cosmetically excellent, mechanically as advertised. Battery health was about 90% when received. All in all very satisfied"
493,Phone works better than expected the facia recognition the fingerprint reader and battery life is better than my iPhone XOR
494,"Really good, had some problems with set up but I think that’s an Apple problem not phone problem. It’s worked great for the last couple weeks! Really love it"
495,I've tried the other resellers and been disappointed. Totally happy with my experience and would use them again for sure. Now if I can just get my young adult children to stop destroying their phones!
496,"Nice color, good outer condition but the phone screens shuts down while your on a call and makes it difficult to end the phone call, screen just keeps flickering and there’s nothing you can do but wait. audio also sometime goes in and out and makes it hard to hear on video calls too. Not enjoyable at all."
497,"Purchased this for my 20yr old daughter. So far she’s pretty pleased. I think I purchased her iPhone 8 from this company, and if so they deserve the 5 ⭐️’s that was given."
498,Arrived quickly and packaged perfectly.  The receivers couldn't have been more pleased.  Great quality.  I'm very happy with the purchase.
499,"Ordered this phone on a Saturday, received it the following Saturday. Battery life at 100% and it was almost fully charged. One tiny scuff on the top edge but only noticeable because I was looking for them. No cracks. Honestly was sooo nervous about ordering it but after a couple days, I just did it. I’m so relieved it was worth it! I’m writing this review from it! I’m sorry for the others it didn’t work out for but it gets my 100% approval."
500,i don;t dilike the product i dislike the fact that this was taken out my account and no one notifed me that this large amount was coming out my account
501,"Has hardware issue, randomly loses service and then says searching for service.  Apple confirmed, it is a hardware issue."
502,"I’ve had this phone for a few days, and everything seems to work great! The battery life came at 86% But I can go with the whole day without charging it! At the end of the day the battery is usually at 45-50%. There isn’t even any scratches or marks that I can notice. This package was delivered on time and it even came with a charger and a cube (not apple products but still work just the same). So glad I was able to save some money!!"
503,We panicked because we were not home for a couple of days.  when we returned the parcel was not at the door .. started looking but did not find .. it turned out the neighbor realized that we were not at home and took us .. we rang the doorbell but no one was .. only a day later she showed up😁.  glue looks new.  very satisfied .. I'll check later how the phone works.
504,"Phone arrived in great shape, battery seems to hold a charge very well. I did have a problem with the supplied aftermarket charging cable, as the phone would give the “accessory not supported” notification. When I swapped to another charge cable the problem stopped and the battery was able to fully charge. Although mine did not arrive in the original packaging, it was well packed in bubble wrap with a glass screen protector installed. Overall, I am satisfied with the phone, although don’t count on the accessories."
505,"We got the phones early in excellent condition,we love everything about them so far no scratches nothing,phone's basically brand new.. two iphone 11 was purchased one for me n my sister ,would Definetly recommend any one to purchase from this seller..absolutely in love with our phones..No problems so far n the phone works well...TY so much."
506,"Dont buy! Camera is always making the clicking noise even when phone is on silent. When I contacted them they told me to call Apple, when I called Apple they said it’s not under warranty your out of luck. No original charger or earbuds."
507,"Was super excited to receive product, however… the screen was super scratched. Phone was sooo dirty and had a lot of scuff marks on it. Then the battery only had a maximum capacity of 86% and you can buy a NEW iPhone 11 64GB from apple for the same price as this… don’t waste your money"
508,My son says that the battery life is great it last for the whole day. It came in great condition just a little minor catching on the phone but the rest is good.
509,"I bought this phone for my daughter 17 years old, she is happy with it . The phone looks good working fine without any problems."
510,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I was scammed, $600 phone does not work."
511,I’ve had my phone for about a week now. No scratches anywhere on the iPhone and it’s internally sound. I’ve had no problems whatsoever.
512,Came with the screen scratched all to pieces and the battery health less than 90. Waste of $600
513,I  never got it so I can give and Opinion on this phone but I have iPhones before and I love them
514,First off it looked like the phone was dropped on concrete and the screen was replaced it had scuffs and cuts all over. The phone itself couldn’t work properly and my boyfriend got so fed up he tried to reset it to factory settings and it took forever for it to even do that. I was embarrassed to give him this for Christmas save your money and get one from Apple!!
515,With $20 difference of the brand new one is not good at all it is so frustrated to have Iphone with 85% battery capacity😡😡
516,Purchased this as a gift for my younger sibling. Works great but does come in an unorthodox box and the charger did not work well. Still an Apple product and worked fine with any carrier. I would definitely take it to a carrier to be activated.
517,"The battery was so bad. Attempt to contact the seller, no response. Buy a new one better than this"
518,"The phone came in like brand new. I’ve been using it for over a month now and it works like brand new. It’s definitely worth the money, and exceeded my expectations. There were no visible or harsh scratches or damage to it when it arrived, and compared to my iPhone 6, the battery life is long. There are plenty of reasons to buy a refurbished phone; money saving and reusing is one of them. I’d say go for it if you really want to."
519,"Phone arrived on, but battery is in great condition. Phone looks like and functions like new. I have no complaints and am very happy with my purchase."
520,"Had to contact Apple support because it apparently had multiple Apple IDs on the same device before, so set up was a bit lame, but once i got in, it was smooth as hell. Still can’t believe I got it at such good price. And it even came with a screen protector!"
521,"Excelente, esta como nuevo sin detalles, una de mis mejores compras en Amazon."
522,Love this phone.
523,"excellent product, the phone arrived in good condition battery in 99% without shock without wear.  the bands released for my country Guatemala, full unlocked.  The shipped charger is not the original one however it is not relevant."
524,"I am satisfied with this product, it also comes with a charger and screen protector. Just a minor scratch noticed on the screen."
525,I bought this back in October because my old iPhone wasn’t working properly. The phone came in within 2 days of purchase. In perfect condition and never had a single issue. Definitely worth it and cheaper than buying at any store!
526,iPhone came as describe and works well. Noticed some little bumps at the bottom of the screen but nothing bad and knew some minor imperfections were bound to come with the phone. Battery was at 83% capacity which is good. Just wish the phone was packaged better because it was clanging around in the box and could have caused potential damage to the phone during shipment.
527,"I will never buy refurbished again! Speaker didn't work, and phone was unusable. Bought before I needed it and could not return it once I found out the speaker and microphone didn't work"
528,I simply love this phone. I would have gave the finger print reader 5 stars but it does not have it
529,Scam DONT buy!!!!!
530,"Very poor quality control before selling product!Buying renewed doesn’t phase me because you figure all the problems were resolved...And should have been!!Arrived on time.After setting up the speaker severely distorted, Phone worthless if you can’t use it!No way should this have been sold as it was!Waste of my valuable time and sad disappointment fir my kiddo.Plus - with Amazon prime - Total and fast refund!"
531,The phone so far seems to run OK but for $500 I expect it not to be extremely scratched and just tore up I can understand as a refurbished phone a few scratches here and there but this one just came extremely extremely scratched and tore up
532,"Firstly, the phone came a day early which is great. Also the packaging was amazing, it came with a screen protector, and a sim card remover tool. The phone itself is very good but it did come with a few scratches which is annoying, but its refurbished so... Overall great phone."
533,"El micrófono estaba dañado, tuve que reemplazarlo y pagar adicional  creo que fue un error comprar este artículo por esta vía y no haberlo comprado directamente en la Apple ya que la diferencia eran 20 dólares."
534,Even if the phone was “renewed” I didn’t encounter any issues or problems.
535,"Everything about this phone would’ve been perfect, until I tried using speaker phone— it’s extremely muffled. The phones speaker output is defective, so expect flaws with refurbished phones. I’ve never had a negative experience until this purchase but I still can’t entirely hate it. I guess just do more research."
536,"I haven’t noticed any issues with this phone. It seems in good working order! I will admit that I noticed it’s selling for about the same price brand new at Apple, but I have no other complaints!"
537,Can with chips all along the sides and battery at 84% (worse than my previous iPhone 7 that I owned for 3 years) and wireless charging works fine but when I plug it in it charges extremely slow. Going to return and replace
538,Has few glitches. My iPhone screen zooms in by itself all the time. I put a screen protected and case on it from the day I bought it. It fell from my lap on to the floor and stopped working of 12 hours. Then it just magically started working again.
539,The screen is scratched up. It’s distracting especially in the sun! 89% battery health. I live Trinidad so I would just have to deal with it….
540,"I was very scared to order a renewed phone but I was in such need of a new iPhone. I love the iPhone 11 I got, it works extremely fast and the battery capacity is at 100%.. there’s a couple of scratches at the top of the iPhone but it’s not doing anything harmful to the phone."
541,The IPhone came in and was one excellent condition! It had a screen protector installed already which was done perfectly! Extremely satisfied with these guys!
542,"display defect on black screen as shown in the photos also phone powered off initially when I launced the camera, tried using camera after reboot it worked and then shuts off tring to switch from the face cam to the rear cam I need my money back"
543,"The phone arrived on time and looked almost new except for two minor blemishes on the “circle” of the camera. All functions are performing as expected, without issues.  Great service!  Thank you"
544,Very happy with this purchase. Arrived with the battery reporting like-new/100% capacity and without any defects that we could see. Has been going strong for well over a month so far.
545,"When I received this refurbished iPhone 11, the first thing I noticed were scratches on the back and scuffs on the sides of the phone. I didn't expect the phone to be perfect but I had hoped the previous owner would have used a case. Returned to buy it new from Apple for $499."
546,"I paid almost $400 for this phone and the battery is no good. The first day it showed the battery health at 85%, now the battery health has dropped to 65%. Now I have to pay a local company to replace the battery.  Don’t waist your money,"
547,The phone has a bad scratch on the screen.
548,The phone works great but I’m disappointed by the scratches the backside has some scratches but the scratch in the frontside at the bottom left is noticeable I wish they would show a picture of the phone to sell and not get surprised when it comes in
549,"At first I was kinda iffy about getting it cause I saw some people said that theirs weren’t unlocked, or it was scratched up, or the sound was bad, but my looks brand new, the sound is great it’s fully unlocked and the battery life is great"
550,Package arrived in a damaged cheap box with no phone it.  Just a chargerMy son spent his own $500 to be very disappointed😡
551,Can’t even download the update to use it cuz battery was at 20% other than that it’s great
552,"This is a product worth buying. The overall condition the phone was when first taken out the box was amazing. Not a visible scratch, great battery life, all features working. Seems like it was brand new from a carrier. Absolutely satisfied with it. Looking forward to buy from this seller again."
553,It’s just difficult too read due to it’s size. I have to turn it sideways in Oder to read and accurately type.
554,MY daughter was elated when she received this for Christmas!  Worked perfectly!
555,Received a day before I expected it and exactly as advertised! Very happy with my experience.
556,"Everything about the phone was perfect except it kept shutting off, no matter how many times I reset the phone. I returned it and bought another from the same seller. No complaints with the new phone, looks brand new and there are no issues with the functionality. I would definitely buy again from this seller."
557,Not an actual IPhone. When you turn it on it says “not supposed by Apple” !! I returned it and got another. I wouldn’t even chance it. Seems to be a fake Apple phone.
558,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   My phone arrived today at around 4pm. It still has not finished installing the new update. I haven’t even gotten into the phone yet. I’m nervous! Thankfully returning it should be easy."
559,"Shipping was fast and phone was like brand new, very pleased with my purchase. Would definitely recommend this vendor."
560,This came fast and it was easy to download from the other phone.
561,"phone came with screen protector on it, not in a apple box but came in perfect condition and 100% battery life capacity.could not be happier with my purchase!"
562,Phone works perfectly! There was a slight cosmetic scratch on the front of my phone but that’s what you get for buying preowned. Had no issues with the phone though and it arrived earlier than expected. Satisfied with my purchase. Upgraded from an iPhone 6 and the battery life is just amazing on the 11.
563,Very nice seller! The yellow is gorgeous! Even included a beautiful neon pink clear case! My 13 year old daughter loves it! It’s he first iPhone! Thanks!
564,It arrived on time. It was as advertised. It's a great product at an amazing price!
565,"El celular vino impecable, con mica, nuevo, sin rayones, batería 100%. Lo compré en EEUU y lo traje a Ecuador, funciona de maravilla. Es la mejor compra que he hecho en años en amazon, pero ojo!!! Comprenlo con BuySPRY, de este proveedor ya había leído reseñas excelentes y no me falló, qué excelente servicio."
566,Right off the bat you can see the phone was visibly dirty and the speakers were filled with dirt. When I tested out the speakers the left side didn’t work at all and the right side sounded off pitch
567,Bought this product for my daughter and she is super happy with it. She is happy to have a phone that is refurbished that looks like new.Thanks!
568,my phones keyboard came broken.
569,Nothing too great. Definitely had a lot of scratches. Battery health was at 81%. Box was a random one. Fulfills the bare minimum but I would definitely go for a new iphone over this.
570,"Luego de transcurrido los 3 meses de garantía y sin lugar a devolución, comenzó a fallar el equipo. Por momentos, y con frecuencia, se bloquea la pantalla y se pone toda negra, no pertiendo realizar ninguna función. Realmente muy mal producto"
571,"It kept looping from a black screen to the Apple logo and never fully booting up. Absolute garbage. Now I have to take it to a UPS store and send it back, then wait for it to get there, and then wait an additional 3 days for my refund."
572,Phone is loaded with features. It is quick and very elegant
573,Wasn’t a Verizon capable phone. Sent it back
574,"The phone arrived packaged well and looked brand new out of the box.  Unfortunately, the particular phone I received crashes constantly.  The apps themselves and phone randomly close or restart.  Will be returning."
575,This is an older model Apple I-phone that was refurbished. It had some very minor scratches on the back which is what we expected. The phone was shipped with no battery power so it had to be charged before it could be used. The battery charged to 88% of a new phone. The phone worked and after a couple of weeks of use I am happy with this purchase.
576,I bought the phone for my daughter so far so good. Personally I wouldn't buy anything Apple but she loved it that's why she got it
577,"Couldn’t find a phone anywhere during the pandemic as my old ones battery was dying out.  I was a little Leary on purchasing this kind of product from Amazon but it arrived quickly, no damage and set up and operated very easily. I would not be afraid to buy an apple product that has been refurbished ever again from amazon"
578,It came with a cracked bottom lens. That wasn’t mentioned in the product description. I think it should have been cheaper if it was gonna come with a damaged camera. I would like a refund to cover the cost to fix the lens at least. | update I had to return the phone. It kept turning off.
579,So far it’s a solid phone. Was unlocked and the battery lasts longer than my last iPhone. No scratches. I’m happy
580,"Came like brand new, with no back scratches and a glass screen protector already applied also has 100% Maximum battery capacity. It’s only about 100 dollars cheaper than on apple's online store and does not include the Apple iphone box, earbuds or charger."
581,Alot of the functions in the phone are slow or do not work half the time. I'm returning for my money back. I'm sure they have other devices that work just fine and I just wasn't lucky with the one they sent.
582,"So, bought this for my daughter and it is NOT unlocked! Metropcs gave her a card to use somewhere who will unlock it for her, but this is really really bad. She uses her phone for work, and now has no phone until she can get this done. A real inconvenience."
583,Upgrades from 7plus.  Touch is rapidly responsive and absence if home button makes for easier use
584,"The phone came in perfect condition! Works great, was 100% unlocked. The only downside would be the settings say it can only charge to 84%. So that kind of stinks. But other than that, not bad!"
585,"Great condition, no noticeable irregularities.  Haven't tried the facial recognition yet."
586,"Iphone 11 working great with no issues setting up with my carrier. Very glad I took the chance on a refurbished product. Came with a screen protector on which was greatly appreciated. Also, a charger was included as described. No earbuds, but given the model of phone I was not expecting some."
587,I’m so happy I took a chance and purchased this phone.  It’s fantastic
588,I love it. I see nothing wrong with it at all no problems setting up.  shipped fast for here early which is great cuz I was so impatient lol! I’m in love I will probably order another one for my girlfriend!
589,"I’m always a bit skeptical when buying electronics online, but I’m overall happy with my purchase! Purchase the iphone unlocked, it arrived unlocked. Just popped my SIM card in and had no problems. Obviously it’s refurbished, but it seemed like new. Just had a few scratches on the front and back (not really noticeable unless you look for them) and the battery health was at 91%."
590,I really need a phone as I just had a galaxy S8 and bought it in 2018 and back in 2020 I decided to put my money towards this instead of a more expensive brand new iPhone and I’m glad I did! It did come with a very faint scratch on the screen which isn’t noticeable unless you really focus but after putting a screen protector on it isn’t even visible anymore.
591,Everything worked great and was exactly as described by seller.  No issues.
592,"This is my first iPhone and I love it. I was nervous about it not working properly or having scratches on it but it exceeds my expectations. Plus, you can’t beat the price for all of this storage space."
593,"I have only had the phone for about 24 hours, but I am so happy with it! Not a scratch, nic, or dent. Looks brand new. It even came with a screen protector all ready on it. Charges fast. Came with brand new charging wire and plug. Did not come in an iPhone box, but did come packaged securely in a similar box. At this point I am beyond thrilled... hope my opinion stays the same in the coming days!"
594,The phone looked like new. No scratches or dents.
595,"My camera seems to be messing up, might be sending it back if it keeps acting up. Every time I switch to portrait mode and take a picture my phone freezes up. Other than that everything is perfect!"
596,I started having problems with this phone about a week ago with the fingerprint reader and when someone calls me the button won’t slide over so I can answer the phone. The touch pad has been messing up as well. I haven’t even had this phone a good two months. I don’t have any water damage or an other damage so not sure why it is acting up.
597,This phone took forever to even arrive and when it did part of the screen did not work and certain keyboard buttons also would not work. Very frustrating to spend this much money on a phone for it to be defective
598,This was a very good value for our money. Love the quality of the pictures it takes and the battery last a long time. Couldn’t be happier if it was a new one !! We actually bought two of them one black and one in red. Both are great!!!
599,"Looks and functions just like a new unit, very satisfied."
600,I’ve ordered one phone and had to send it back got another one and had to send it back phones wasn’t working properly don’t recommend on buying from this seller
601,I don’t know what’s up with this case but I cannot get it to stick on my phone without damaging either my phone or the case
602,"Apparently, they are supposed to test the devices, and yet I was still sent one with an unresponsive screen. How does something that glaring of a defect make it past initial testing? Waste of time and money. I'll be sure to not buy from this reseller again."
603,"The company that bought this phone bought a stolen phone therefore the phone was reported locked to the carriers. The had to take it to get fixed and payed an extra 50 dollars. Other than that, the phone works great"
604,"Since it’s renewed I new what to expect but everything was great! It got here less than a week , only a tiny scratch on the bottom none in front ,back or sides. Then went to see if it was unlocked and it was."
605,"The phone was great, ready to use, almost no damage. One very small scratch on the screen, doesn’t seem to effect the phone at all. We put a screen protector on it, and it’s been just as if we bought it brand new."
606,"I really love this phone! I was really nervous about it at first, but it came in really fast so not too much time to worry! When it arrived it was in perfect condition except for a lil bit of scuff marks in the top corner ( apply a lil dab of toothpaste and they become less noticeable! ) so I’m very, very happy with my purchase!"
607,"Friends, just for you know ""renewed"" is a euphemism for ""used"". You will get a used phone.My phone had two cosmetic wear signals. The corner of the screen was scratched and it has a dent in the corner."
608,Great deal for the price. Has ran flawless since purchase 3 months ago. No problems with anything so far
609,It seems to mostly fine so far although sometimes will not contact to wifi hard to set up printer or send photos to my phone or computer says not connected. No fingerprint will come on but face works
610,"It works fine but some times it go slow of the system, the phone looks ok no damage or anything, only thing you have to beware you might get a bad one I feel, you pay what you get !"
611,"This phone is everything it’s cracked up to be. Take great pics, long lasting battery plus an easy to use touchscreen."
612,"Had to return. When attempted to activate at AT&T, sound did not work—neither sending or receiving calls. Everything else about phone was fine. Attempted to contact company—no response. Had to work w Amazon to return for refund."
613,No complaints about the phone... everything works!! Had it for 3 months
614,"item as described, no Apple box, I wish I knew, also no headsets."
615,The phone arrived on time and looks and works like new.  It was a great value for the price.
616,"Do not purchase!!! I bought as a Christmas gift and my daughter has had nothing but issues with the camera. Unfortunately, we are unable to return because of how long it has been since purchased. I will never again by a ""renewed"" phone again. Now I have to spend even more money replace my daughter's phone."
617,"I’ve had no issues with this phone. I don’t think it needs to be thinner or thicker. Feels right the way it is. Face recognition works, although I hope there is an update soon that can also recognize you with a covid protection mask."
618,I Purchased this for my sideman and he is very satisfied with his purchase. It came in the original box with original accessories
619,"The battery life is pretty bad and it came with a ding in the top right corner, but otherwise it's pretty good"
620,"This is a great phone.  If you’re using it for Straight Talk, be aware that you’ll have to get the BYOB sim package for it to work"
621,Just as described from seller came brand new just wish they also included an original charging cord and box my daughter loves it
622,"The iPhone 11 is an excellent phone. However, the one I purchased crashed and the Bluetooth and Wifi failed. I contacted the company and they refunded my money without a whole lot of hassle."
623,Low battery life. Other than that it looks like new one
624,"Hello. I really liked the phone, and I have no complain about its operation. However, I bought the phone but I live in Angola and I didn't know that it was locked for att.I know its my fault, and I'm really sad because I can't use the phone right now.Can you help me?I tried to unlock it on  att website, but they ask me for the first phone contact associated with the phone, and I don't have that information."
625,"I bought the purple iPhone11 it came I perfect condition!!! I was a little weary about buying a phone off of Amazon, but I’m so glad that I did!!! The only complaint I have is the battery health is at 88% but that’s nothing a new battery can’t fix!!!! I love it so much!!! Highly suggest getting it if you are on the fence!!!"
626,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   This was a Christmas gift for my 16 year old daughter. After and while setting up the phone the device continues to constantly restart. Really can’t get any use out of phone. Contacting seller immediately for return shipping label. Way too expensive to be defective!"
627,Lamentablemente por ese precio el equipo no está en exelente condiciones presenta rallado en la pantalla bastante visible y un golpe también visible en la esquina derecha superior no lo puedo regresar porque estoy en vzla no deberían ofrecer productos en ese estado
628,"When peeling the phone film off, there were shards of glass coming from somewhere on the phone. There was also an almost intentional cursive H dead smack in the middle of the screen. No iphone certified accessories were included, only 3rd party.Its the same price, new, from the Apple store. Just do that."
629,Beautifully packaged iphone! It came with a charger too!
630,"After reading some of the reviews I was a little nervous however, phone arrived just about brand new. Glass had no imperfections, phone had no scratches. No internal issues, sound, quick loss of battery. Functions as a new phone.I'm pleasantly surprised"
631,Worked for a few weeks perfectly then after that I would use it for a little and the phone would get really hot and also the battery would decrease insanely fast
632,Great phone and quality for refurbished
633,"I admit, I was a little skeptical first. Spending $700 on an unknown seller, but after reading some reviews I went for it. The phone looks just like new, no cosmetic damage, works perfectly well. I got mine unlocked and activated it to my carrier same day. I upgraded from a 6s so big change!!! Loving it!"
634,"Screen has a few scratches as stated in listing. Battery life is 96%. For the money, it could have been sent with a Apple charger and some ear buds. But so far it works like it should. I’d buy again"
635,"I got it for a friend, the screen has a lot is scratches, I would have returned if it was for myself, not good money value, I’m not even sure about battery 🤷‍♀️"
636,iPhone 11 came with a screen protector on it but had multiple gashes in the screen which the screen protector was trying to cover up. I tried emailing BuySpry and they still haven't responded and they're making me pay for return shipping. Do not use them if you can avoid it.
637,"Face recognition good , fingerprint works well and battery life great ."
638,"I was skeptical at first but wow this phone is in perfect condition! No scuffs, scratches, or anything. Cameras, battery life, everything is perfect! A definite must buy! I currently have Cricket Wireless & it works!"
639,"It's a good buy, but the charger didn't work."
640,I got this as a Christmas gift for my 16 year old son and he is very pleased with this gift which is not an easy feat. iPhones are really good phones in general and I am happy with this purchase.
641,Works great. Good for its price.
642,I bought this used phone  for my daughter.  It was in perfect condition.  She loves it. Her favorite color rven.
643,"en general está muy bien el iPhone, los únicos defectos con que el botón para subir el volumen no funciona bien, tengo que presionar muy fuerte para que el volumen aumente.otra cosa es que al abrir la camara, hace un ruido extraño y tiembla, esto pasó después de actualizar el software."
644,I am very pleased as to the condition when it arrived.
645,"I was worried about the phone’s condition at first, however, it was in pristine condition. The phone even had a screen protector on it, and came with its own charger. All in all great quality product."
646,The phone came fast and handed right to me.. plus got a free case for my phone:)
647,My mom loves it!Didn't break the bank
648,"When I first received the package it was a little hard setting up, but as I continued it got easier. The phone has an amazing camera, speakers, and plenty more."
649,The phone I received will not even turn on! Will not charge- nothing. Now I am out a phone for even longer- have to wait for them to send me a shipping slip before I can even start the refund process. I don't understand- do they not even quality check phones before sending? Very disappointed.
650,The phone is a little heavier than I expected but so far I love it. The screen is great and the camera is great. It’s easy to use and it was easy to set up.
651,I definitely like the phone but I was supposed to receive purple instead I received a white phone
652,"I was sold a phone from this company that didn’t have a functioning speaker or any sound at all. This made me late to work when I woke up to zero sound for my alarm. No sound for calls, music, ringer, anything. Double check if you order a phone from here before going about your day."
653,Love my new phone phone wish it would have came with a set of headphones but whatever..
654,"It arrived before expected, was well packed,with no damage I could see. The phone seems to work well and I’ve had no problems with it."
655,"Pantalla no original salta mensaje de que el repuesto no es original y se reinicia cada 3 minutos, luego de restaurarlo por itunes no prendio mas. Es la cuarta vez que me pasan cosas extrañas con telefonos usados"
656,AWFUL phone BUT....very quick to respond to return request! Wish phone could have worked!Hopefully my refund gets processed quick too.
657,"My new iPhone arrived on time, in great shape, and unlocked. I would recommend to anyone."
658,"FaceID, great bluetooth range, long lasting battery, perfect amount of storage space, huge discount compared to purchasing new from apple, purple is my favorite color :)"
659,Thank you for the fast shipping. My daughter was very happy. Everything looks great thus far.
660,Nice
661,I like the phone but almost at the 2 week point the volume had problems and couldn’t get a good response from the people said they didn’t recognize the IMEI number it was invalid?? So I’m looking at having to get it fixed after paying almost 700.00 for the phone. I’ll never purchase anything from them again so disappointed.
662,I like that it came with a full charger and screen protector. When I opened the package the box was opened and the plastic film was barley on the phone. So I ignored that and continue to set up the phone using my account. It said it has to be updated and has been doing so for almost 24hrs now
663,Needed to upgrade my phone and this is the ticket--I'm still learning and so far I have no complaints!!!!
664,"Screen problems since day one try to get a replacement  but no answer finally get a partial  refund  lost about 50% of value, they install a cheap  screen  n sell  to smeoneelse"
665,"Works great,looks good worth the money"
666,"Love it. Camera quality is very good. Shipping fast. Battery life last longer. Phone was overall in good condition, but the box did arrive smashed."
667,"My daughter's birthday was last Sunday and I struggled hard about buying her the one thing she asked for. When the item came, even though it was 2 days later, she was filled with tears when she saw her purple iPhone 11. The site made it easy to order and with prime shipping, it was here in no time."
668,LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!! It even came with a screen protector. Looks brand new! Thank you so much!! It says it’s locked for only Verizon but I’m on cricket and it works just fine. I love this phone it’s amazing
669,"it came october 15th and never had any issues with it at all, only con is the battery life, its not THAT bad but it definitely doesnt last as long as when i first had it, came with no scratches. did come with a charger, no screen protector which is fine. 8/10 :)"
670,"Very nice phone for much less than new, but like new."
671,It came in a good condition and works well
672,"The description wasn't very accurate, it said ""There will be no visible cosmetic imperfections when held at an arm’s length"" but you could easily see all the scratches, there was even a hole on the side, and the cameras had suffered!  Battery was at 85% of original capacity, not better than my 3 years old iPhone. On the contrary, the screen was brand new."
673,Because the phone was renewed it's not water proof so please don't place it in water.The phone works very good other than the water issue
674,Apple will NOT provide apple care. This is several phone put into one
675,Its my first time buying refurbished i am Amazed it feels like brand new and the best thing is i dint have to pay thkusand if dollars . Tha ks to seller keep it up!
676,"Terrible item. Had to take it to the apple store to even activate. Stated it has ""unauthorized equipment"" but Apple got it working. Phone randomly starts shutting down. Then, at the first update it shuts down & won't connect to charger, computer, anything! TERRIBLE TERRIBLE PRODUCT! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY"
677,I liked the quality of this phone was so much better than I expected! Looked brand new.
678,phone is advertised as unlocked but it’s definitely locked. i had to go to apple to tell me the carrier then go to sprint to have it unlocked.
679,New iPhone user and I’m still getting used to it but so far so good. There are a few things that I miss from my Android but I guess that’s expected. Phone was in great condition but it was missing a Headset.
680,Battery life on phone is less than 85 percent! Doesn't last long!
681,I received the first one and the back was shattered but the company made it right and got me a better one within 2 weeks.
682,"The iPhone 11 I received was in great shape, no scratch look like brand new!"
683,"This is a refurbished phone. Minor scratches on the back and sides of the phone. However, with a phone case you don’t see any of the cosmetic damage. Phone works like a champ and holds a charge."
684,"the phone came in greasy and scratches on the screen, returned right away!"
685,This product came in really fast and although I was skeptical it came without any scratches or any damage to the phone and a phone charger. Although it didn’t come in the original apple box it came very secure. If you want a cheaper iphone like this one I would definitely  give this one a try
686,"The best phone that I’ve had. My battery last a very long time, it’s super fast, no scratches, it’s like this is a brand new phone and don’t get me started on the cameras..... I have found my true love 😂❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
687,Battery wasn’t replaced like I expected in a refurbished phone
688,"Arrived on time! Easy to connect to my carrier(metro PCs/t-mobile). Long lasting battery life. Non original charge, but still works with the charger that came with. Light scratches on one of the phones. Overall good purchase!"
689,"Excelente producto, en muy buen estado, es lo que buscaba"
690,Love my phone it’s pretty and easy to use however the charger was iffy
691,The phone was in good condition. The only mark I could find was at the very bottom of the screen. It had a very small scratch that is mostly on the bezel not the screen. That's the only reason I didn't mind it. The battery health was 89% which is pretty good. It works great so far. No issues here.
692,I recently made the switch from the Samsung Galaxy S10 to the IPhone 11 and the phone arrived fast looking practically brand new. No scratches or blemishes. Maximum battery capacity is 85% but this phone holds a charge pretty good. I've had the phone for a month now with no issues. This is my 2nd purchase from this seller and I will buy again in the future.
693,"I absolutely love this! It connected to my carrier right away and it had no dings or cracks or anything. I was definitely skeptical about buying an “unlocked” phone online but I’m glad I did. The battery life is at 88% which is still good and it’s nothing to get a new battery when it comes time for that. But otherwise, I’m super happy with the phone."
694,The phone is in very good condition. It is working perfect and looks like new.
695,I love it! I was upset because when received the box was open and the phone was sliding around. It was not damaged though. Other than that the phone it’s self is awesome! Came with a charger and films on both sides of the phone.
696,No issues. Fantastic.
697,Everything is okay 👍🏼
698,Muy bueno si por desir exelente bien protegido yedo dos dias antes no tube problema con el rastre enfin bolveria a comprar otro con este vendedor tenia dudas por nocer distribuido por Amazon pero wow muy bien lo isieron
699,I was sooo worried when I ordered this phone but let me tell you something..... it’s amazing!  Works great.  If u have second thoughts don’t bc it’s worth it.
700,I love yellow! This phone is awesome! The camera is perfect and the phone battery life is better.
701,Great deal
702,I was not sure what to expect with this device. However the device looks like new. Battery life is outstanding.
703,"My cell came earlier than expected. Great conditions, I love it. I highly recommend to buy this product. It pared all my apps, passwords, everything from my I-phone 6 plus easily"
704,"Please don’t listen to what other people say. The reviews almost made me not buy. My daughter just received her phone it is everything yes it is worth the money 💰 I’m about to order me one. Gamer is nice, it’s loud and brand new we love love love it so much"
705,The phone seemed  great! But the battery just wouldn’t stay charged and took a long time to get charged. We took it in to replace the battery and they encouraged us to trade phones. But Amazon was fabulous to work with and we would definitely buy a phone from them again in the future.
706,I purchased this phone as a gift and was as expected. Small dings on the back side but no major defect and the phone works great.
707,"100% working conditions, only few scratches no noticeable with the cover. Great Buy!"
708,"Great phone. Does everything it should. One odd thing is, it takes a lot longer to fully charge than any other phone I remember."
709,A gift for my husband. He loves it. Looks like new. Works very well so far.
710,Paid 2/3 the retail price and love it.
711,Have had this phone for 3 months now and no issues! Battery life is great and worked with our pay by month phone plan
712,Except for the unboxing experience (Plain white box) the phone is BRAND NEW. I couldn't believe it. No scratches or scuffs a screen protector and charger 100 % battery. It in Product Red. I'm VERY satisfied.
713,So far so good haven’t had any problems with any apps with service I love my phone it came a day early very satisfied
714,"This purple iphone 11 is Amazing, accurate description and shipping was fast. Thank you so so much. 😊"
715,Phone was constantly power cycling had to end up returning the device
716,"excelente estado .batería 95% , buen precio excelente como regalo"
717,Love the color and Apple products! So excited that the phone is unlocked and I can use any network on it. The phone looks like it’s brand new.
718,Came defective. Nothing renewed about it
719,It was a great phone but the Bluetooth didn’t work on it. The company has been great to work with and we’re just waiting on a refund after having to return it.
720,I dislike everything I used just for 3 weeks and the fine died I m so sad about
721,I really needed a new phone and this was great! It was a lot cheaper then buying it anywhere else. I came in perfect condition and worked like it was brand new.
722,I love how fast the phone is and camera is so clear. But the battery dies quick. My IPhone XR lasts way longer so I’m gonna have to replace the battery soon.
723,It was a good buy. Look like new.
724,A few scratches on the bezel but all in 40% cheaper than buying new.
725,"got the phone super fast and it was unlocked and ready to go! super happy with it, it’s been 3 months now since my purchase and i haven’t run into any problems."
726,"When I took this phone out the box, it looked brand new. It came in perfect condition as you can see in the pics. And to top it off, the battery health was at 95%. Really happy with this purchase."
727,Liked the product but didn’t appreciate the double charge from my checking account n still have heard no response after I have messaged to customer serviceVoukx someone please take care of this matter immediately. Very disappointed about the situation
728,This phone was in the best condition. No scratches no dents. Battery health was on 86% however that did t phase me because it’s working flawlesslyThe face is on point no hiccups
729,Way better then getting a phone plan and doing payments everything works good came with a screen protector but I am a bad drunk and drop my phone so I have to get a new one.  Good phone and camera and battery life after all good deal
730,Phone arrived fast and was as advertised. I added my SIM card and was up and running in minutes. The only disappointing thing was my phone came with a poorer battery health than what I was hoping for. But it is a used phone after all. Oh well.
731,I bought this phone for my son and it is perfect! Not a scratch on it!I am very pleased!
732,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter and the phone is unlocked. We were able to get it setup and on our current carrier. Please as punch.
733,This thing was in pristine condition there is no way that you could tell me that it's device was a refurbished model if I wasn't the one who purchased it and took it from the box...98% battery health and face ID working like a charm if you're on a budget this right here is where it's at...
734,Great price for this phone. Months later we write this review. We are happy.
735,I purchased this phone as a Christmas gift. It was “tested” and supposedly “like new and fully functional.” The screen is badly scratched. Face ID does not work. The back glass is badly scratched. There is no time for a return and refund. I am being offered a $20 refund.  ?!?!?!?  What a rip-off!!!
736,"I was very skeptical because of some of the reviews. It came with a very small scratch on the screen that was hard to see unless you really looked. That has been the only thing that was “wrong” with the phone. Other than that, the phone has worked amazing, great battery life, awesome camera, and no hiccups on how it works."
737,"Great iPhone! Have had no problems with it, it came completely unlocked and ready to go all I had to do was put my SIM card in it and I was ready to go! It had ZERO scratches or marks on it. Well worth the price."
738,I bought this phone for my daughter. She used it two day and she was contacted that it was stolen.
739,"I’m loving everything about this phone! It’s definitely worth the hype, and the money. I love all of the features, and I can’t think of a weak link so far. I was skeptical before purchasing it, but I’m glad that I did. One of the things that I like about it is the face recognition"
740,"I waited for 3 months to do this review. I started using this phone October 25, and it’s been great. These pictures were taking fresh out the box.Phone is in excellent condition, almost new until I checked the battery % which was at 87%.Otherwise, absolutely no faults."
741,"Love the face recognition, Fingerprint recognition."
742,Minor imperfections around the camera but other than that it’s perfect!
743,Phone was really scratched and dented dissatisfied  because this wasn’t my first purchase from seller I won’t be purchasing again from this seller
744,"El celular vino en excelentes condiciones físicas, lo único que me desmotiva es el nivel de la batería, vino en 83% sin embargo tenía claro que había una gran posibilidad de que llegara con ese por ciento, ya que lo indica las características; fuera de eso estoy muy contenta con la compra y el artículo"
745,Excellent condition!!
746,"Producto en excelentes condiciones fisicas, con un mes de garantía, batería al 99%, sin rayones, cámara y pantalla en excelente estado. Imei original, totalmente desbloqueado y funcional para las redes móviles en Colombia. Caja y cargador genérico marca LG, cable lightnin apple y entrega en el tiempo estimado, incluso un día antes de lo previsto. En general, muy buena experiencia de compra."
747,Good product. Decent price
748,"El teléfono en su mayoría llegó tal cual las especificaciones, sin embargo; las bocinas no funcionan."
749,"The phone is fine it works normal but it charges so so slow, I left it all night and it charged maybe to 70% I’m gonna try to fix this but if not then I will be returning it. It also didn’t come with an actual apple charger so I’ll be buying a new one."
750,The phone had a blown speaker
751,They said the phone was factory unlock the Internet didn’t work couldn’t download apps it made my 16-year-old daughter cry on Christmas
752,"It’s been 4 months since I purchased this phone, have been using it every day since. Phone came perfect not scratch or any signs of previous use. Haven’t experienced a singe problem in 4 months and have tears and used just about every feature of the phone 5/5"
753,"It’s been a few days and it’s working perfectly fine. Only flaws is that it didn’t come in a nice box and the charging brick plus the wires was off brand. Overall 4/5. It would be a good phone for older people in my opinion, not too good neither too bad, just right for them."
754,"I went from an Android to the iPhone. It was so easy to set up, and face recognition was quick.  I can go two days before charging it that’s how well the charge holds. I’m really glad I made the switch."
755,Private use. It’s easy to use.
756,El celular fue recibido en excelentes condiciones. Ni un solo rasguño o golpe. Funciona a la perfección.
757,I bought this iPhone in October 2019 and the speaker is already giving issues. Even if something was wrong with the phone before and it was fixed it shouldn’t have started giving problems so quickly. The return date has already passed so there’s nothing I can do or I would just send it back but I spent a lot of money on the item so I need something to be done please.
758,"As if I went to the apple store and bought it straight from there, but cheaper for the storage. I’ve had this phone for about 5 months now and all that I’ve seen is it’s gets a bit hot if I use big apps, and it lags a bit if I have too many things opened. But it’s literally good."
759,"Unlocked as promised, 10/10 in conditions, battery 91%, best buy ever"
760,Loved the phone just popped my sim in and it works the screen was gorgeous no problems I love my 11 so much thank u and greatest value for your money please buy and it came a day early
761,"so basically chainsawman is a super good super fast paces, almost too fast paces manga!! it geting an anime adaption this december but u can skip the wait for weekly episodes and just read the manga. the mc, denji, comes from an indebted background. his only friend being an odd dog. desperate money he sold his balls."
762,Before getting this phone I had the 8 for about a year so it took time to get used to no button at the bottom but overall it was worth it all I have to do is look at my phone and it turns on not mention it seems faster than my old phone in essentially every way possible.
763,"It’s a great phone, exactly what I wanted, it works really well, I love Face ID. Battery life is much longer than older iPhones, and I’m glad it doesn’t have the fingerprint reader anymore. Really good value."
764,"The microphone for calls doesn't work. I'm going to be sending this back. To people on the other line, I sound very faint and as if I were in a very busy atmosphere."
765,"I was expecting a USED phone (visible signs of) but instead, you can hardly tell that it has been used other that the two (very faint) scratches at the back. The phone works well and was unlocked. Original charger also came with the phone."
766,Much like my I6 in operation. Great value.
767,Took phone to Verizon & was told it’s LOCKED. Was got for my teenage Daughter for Christmas & she is so disappointed as this was all she got for Christmas. Was Ordered FULLY UNLOCKED !
768,"Bought an iPhone 11 from this seller. The phone came with minor details in the screen, only visible under light. The battery was at full capacity. Totally recommend this seller."
769,Battery health is at 96% so super happy about that. Phone is in perfect condition and unlocked for all carriers as advertised. 10/10 would recommend.
770,I like this phone upgrade it from a droid so far so good I like the picture quality seems like a pretty good phone
771,100% worth it. This phone came brand new for a phone that was supposed to be “refurbished” it’s my second phone purchase from them and they were both new. If your skeptical don’t be 💯💯💯
772,Perfectly functional brand new unlocked iphone
773,"No tiene signos de maltrato, llegó bien empacado y protegido, total en versátil"
774,it didn’t even turn on. don’t waste your money here just buy it new from apple
775,The phone looks amazing and sounds amazing. I love everything about it. WAY BETTER THAN SAMSUNG!! I suggest this phone to everyone. It is a great buy. It is a 100% new even thought it is being resold. It has no fault. Might as well call it new. I am super happy with this phone. :)
776,The phone is work great but has little scratches on the screen everything is work is good
777,I bought this for my daughter and she seems to love it.
778,"Came in almost perfect condition. Slightly scuffed on the rim of the camera, but the glass on the camera and screen were immaculate. Very happy with my purchase."
779,More capacity
780,It’s ashamed this was mid marked as an unlocked phone. My teenager saved to buy an iPhone and then we ended up buying at apple store for about $40 less
781,Looks just as described in the description. Works well as expected.
782,"Go the phone and damn I was surprised how clean it is, ran it through 3Utools and everything checked out, no changes were made and the battery was at 88 instead of 85 as the label said, I easily get a full day and more of battery life on this device."
783,Honestly when it came in I was very happy but unfortunately some letter didn’t work on the keyboard and I pressed on the letter and wouldn’t go through so honestly I paid 700$ and the phone looked very good but the screen wasn’t good. I’m sorry but sorry but I know you can do better next time. But I still recommend getting it because most phones do come in at its best.
784,Phone worked just as expected. looked brand new. Bought for my son and he has no complaints
785,It was given as a Christmas gift for my great granddaughter she hasn’t fully set it up yet so it’s difficulty to rate at this time
786,4 stars because there were a few tiny scratches on the screen but everything else was in good condition. Got exactly what I ordered. Battery capacity at 100%
787,i love my new phone its in grate condition and came 2 weeks early
788,"Happy with the phone so far only complaint is it arrived with scratches on screen face, since my screen protector kinda hides it ,  Is only reason i did not send it back"
789,This phone is lovely and doesn't have a scratch on it!Great purchase!
790,The Phone didn't work it has software issues
791,Esta en perfectas condiciones muy buena compra total mente satisfecha
792,"Shipped VERY fast. Popped my SIM card right in and had no problem ever since. Came with no scratches or cracks, perfect condition. I love my new phone!"
793,My son is going to love his new phone
794,"Love this iPhone, it’s in impeccable shape & it works fantastic!  I recommend this iPhone 100%"
795,Daughter love it
796,Very happy with this purchase...arrived timely as advertised works fine
797,"Good buy. I got my phone on timel. The phone is almost looks brand new also battery life is great, camera works amazing. I so happy with my purchase. Definitely a Good product"
798,My grown daughter loves this!
799,Very fast shipping! I received my phone in one day! Great experience buying with this seller. Phone in perfect condition and came with charger. Love it! Highly recommend this seller!
800,"I have never used this product before but I’m trouble with my iPhone 8 and am ready for an upgrade. The camera looks really nice, it’s in new condition and it is set to the original settings on the phone."
801,Phone arrived in perfect condition! I was worried because I’ve never bought a used phone before. Very happy with the purchase. Have had phone for several months now and still great.
802,phone has terrible scratches on the sides of the paint. face id does not work. the phone is a waste of money. do not buy from this seller.
803,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   The screen was popped out. When I removed the cover to insert SIM card. These marks were found on the inner side of the screen. Also the screen isn’t in its place. Otherwise everything was good! Even the battery life."
804,Works good I’ve had it for about a month and it works just like a new phone no problems out of it. Can’t even tell it’s refurbished has some small scratches on the back that aren’t noticeable but other than that it’s a good phone
805,As someone who solely lives off service industry tips buying a new phone was super risky. I took the chance on buying a refurbished phone and it was my best financial decision I’ve made :) It’s practically brand new
806,I normally don’t write reviews but I had to honest best phone I ever brought and I can’t believe it’s not new
807,"Super fast shipping, phone in pristine condition AND a free gift (A cute pink phone case I absolutely love) this phone has been a good buy thus far....💜"
808,Huge improvemnet from the iphone 6s that i had earlier. hopefully sometime in the future apple will finally listen to us users and improve the battery life on iphone.
809,Battery life is on 85% when I got this phone never had a renewed phone battery percentage be that low. I’m hoping that the battery will last me for a year or until i get a new phone
810,I bought this refurbished. It was in excellent condition except for 3 small chips to screen. I paid $500 and it is well worth it. Why buy a new version when you can wait a year and buy a refurbished one for half the price?
811,Idk if it’s really worth it when I got mine the screen started glitching and I have like this light spot on the bottom and I also found out that the speaker was blown its sounds like someone farting when I play a song I would return but those things don’t bother me personally but it may be a deal breaker for someone else
812,"My first day of using this phone, and with half a battery, the phone just dies. Then I get a notification saying it’s not an “Apple battery” so now my phone constantly has an error message and I never really know what the battery is at."
813,Asta el momento muy bien no ah fallado
814,I was pretty skeptical but this turned out to be great. Phone works perfect and its a really nice upgrade to my old phone.
815,"I have to say, I was super scared to buy this phone off Amazon due to some suspicious reviews but I'm so glad I did! Not only is the item just as described, it has 100% battery capacity. It feels just like new, with no damages to be seen. Fully unlocked and everything works great! Couldn't be more excited :)"
816,Purchased fully unlocked phone but the phone received was locked by AT&T with an outstanding bill on the account.
817,So far I’m loving my new phone.
818,my phone came quickly and it is so easy to use. i love accessorizing it with new cases often.
819,"It even came with a fast charger, great conditions, loving it"
820,"Usually when you order online there is skepticism regarding quality, this is one purchase I can say was worth the money. It came looking exactly the way it was shown and described (including being unlocked)"
821,Missing headphones charger old
822,The price is more than a brand new one but it was a gift for my daughter so I kept it
823,Love Apple products! So excited that it’s unlocked and I can use on any network. The phone looks like new!
824,Great Product.... Go Get It..... Well Worth It....!
825,Listen hardware wise it’s okay. Some missing chips in paint and a lot of little scratches from an angle hopefully it doesn’t cause too much trouble when the screen protector comes in(will update later). Software I don’t see any problems so far but will edit if there comes an issue!
826,Grandson loves it
827,Have no option was sent back
828,It works great . Works very well for everyday programs and work.
829,I would have love the Apple Iphone 11 Pro Max 256GB Unlocked for the same prize.
830,My boyfriend and I both got phones and they work perfectly. I’ve had it for 6/7 months now and through drops and everything it’s still a great phone. The size and color were exactly what we ordered it came in a nice box and earlier than the delivery time! Def recommended
831,This phone is a replacement for a iPhone 6splus.
832,This seller is always the best.the phone I received is amazing. My daughter loves her graduation gift.
833,"Works perfectly, shipped quickly! AAA + qualityThis is my second purchase and they both were flawless transactions!"
834,First off I’m super surprised it came brand spanking new like no defects no chips no scratches and 100% battery no nasty flies or anything just pure bliss.lastly I skeptical just like you looking at this but I’ll tell right now it’s worth it I’m not sponsored either so you know it true
835,Is ok
836,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Chubbiestech packaging is nice but come on man to much scratches on the screen and the camera lens have dust inside of it next time do better but I will give a Second chance"
837,Daughter loved the phone. Works as it should.
838,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   The back camera isn’t working it’s flickering out of control ."
839,"El celular está en buen estado pero la vida de la batería no muy bien estaba a un 93% cuando lo compramos y 1 mes después a 85%. Llego con un cargador de muy mala calidad, lo pusimos a cargar con este y luego de unos minutos el celular se empezó a recalentar, lo dejamos de usas inmediatamente."
840,I always use my AirPods when I use the phone but today for the 1st I didn’t and the could NOT hear anything from the other person at all! The literally had to use a different phone to make my call because I tried several times and the speaker is broke!
841,Awesome
842,"Bought a refurbished iphone. The lcd screen had horizontal lines on the day I got it. It shows up intermittently. Not a deal breaker as I need a phone and wouldn't go through the hassle of returning it. But given I paid near 500 dollars for it, it is a disappointment."
843,I was impressed that it already came with a screen protector and the phone is as brand new as it could be :) It was in perfect condition! Thank you!
844,👍
845,"After many hours on the phone with my service provider, it was finally decided that the phone just wasn't unlocked and unusable. Sent the refurbished phone back and went to the Apple store to buy a new one."
846,"Exactly as described, I was a little hesitant and did a lot of research before purchasing but it is definitely work it! Does not come in original Apple packing, so you won’t get an apple charger, or any other accessories. However it does come with a new charger."
847,This item arrived about a few months ago and so far there have been no issues. Time will tell.
848,My daughter love her new phone....the only thing it heats fast.
849,I was worried it would not be authentic but it is. Ofc it didn’t come with the original apple box and earbuds but its fine. It came with the charger but not an apple charging brick just a regular white one I dont mind though It charges pretty fast. Overall It was worth the money :)
850,I havent turn it on to a company yet just playing around with it thru wifi
851,"In fact, this phone is a used phone that has not been renewed at all. There are fine scratches, and there are fatal scratches on the screen. This is completely different from what I expected. I will never recommend this store to people."
852,Works as should and I love my new phone!
853,I love the phone however you will need a new SIM card for Boost Mobile service. Besides that everything works fine and looks absolutely amazing! Definitely will recommend!!!
854,I love everything about this product and I’m not just saying that like I’m an apple fanboy it’s a really good phone great features and so on siri annoys me cause she chimes in for no reason but that’s always a thing over all it was well worth it .
855,Phone arrived glass looked as if change had rubbed against it and scratched. Rubber around phone looked like it was chewed by a small rodent. Easy return and no hassle on that aspect. For a few more bucks get a refurb direct from Apple.
856,This phone was delivered earlier than expected! It was packaged well and looks brand new! No damages or scratches. Battery life is great. The phone came with a charger and key to open the sim tray. Definitely worth it!!!
857,"Phone did not work when received. Instead of simply replacing it, one must wait for full refund and purchase again. Customer service is not great."
858,"Everything about the phone worked perfectly fine, the only issue is that it cannot connect to Boost Mobile"
859,"Al encender el equipo, me percaté que tenía un defecto en un pixel completo de la pantalla, luego que ingreso el sistema me arroja que colocaron una pantalla que no es la original, totalmente insatisfecho con la compra. No recomendado."
860,No fingerprint reader.
861,"At first I was like ehhh I hope this works. Got it as a gift for my boyfriend. The price was great and everywhere else was sold out. We were able to get it all set up with no issues. After a few months, it’s still working just fine."
862,Got this phone for sons birthday he was super disappointed after three months there was mother board issues…
863,The capacity of the battery is very low since it’s for someone in Haiti who don’t really have full access of electricity. What could you do for that?But everything is good beside that..
864,the phone came fully charged and ready to go. Looks prefect so far works great.
865,Please stop false advertising to get sales if it’s not truly unlocked just say that now my little sister has to pay to get her phone unlocked. But other than that her phone came in good condition so I only knocked off two stars.
866,"phone was literally brand new it looked like. no issues whatsoever. was skeptical because some of the reviews, but glad I got the iPhone 11 for a used price with brand new quality."
867,"Absolutely stunning, looks brand new, works great and love the color and storage is amazing"
868,My daughter loves it
869,Very good
870,The phone is beautiful got it activated and everything but one small problem I noticed was that when I have my dark mode on you can see a blue mark in the middle of the phone wish I didn’t have that problem but I won’t replace it unless the screen gets worse. Ps I received it like that be careful everyone
871,Got in perfect condition and definitely recommend it was very fast and easy to set up with T-Mobile
872,Phone came in looking brand new! It had protective film covering on the screen and back of the phone. Works like new and so far so good. Battery life has been tremendous compared to the iPhone 6s battery life i was used to.
873,Fast shipping/delivery. Came a day earlier than expected. Phone appearance is “as new” and everything functions as it should. Came with a reasonably charged battery to be able to transfer and set-up from previous phone. Daughter loves it.
874,"Excellent phone, highly recommend buying renewed from Amazon."
875,I received this device and half the screen does not work it is impossible to type on it and it goes crazy when you try to navigate the screen
876,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Battery life in 100%Just like newPerfect"
877,So far I’m very happy. Sent right away and looks brand new. I’ll write a new one in about a month.
878,I had to repair the display speaker on the phone this costed me additional $245. I was left with no choice because I was without a phone. NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS.
879,"Defective phone, needed a motherboard. This phone was absolute garbage. I sent it to Ghana, Africa to a cousin so there’s no way I can return it for full refund. I got screwed on this deal big-time."
880,Like it. Nice phone easy to use.
881,Love the lilac color. Exactly what I ordered and have been using it for a few months now without any issues.Received it in excellent condition. I can’t see any scratches or faults. Would definitely purchase again.
882,"This is a great phone, great price and I am very happy with buying a renewed phone! The SIM card removal tool was underneath the packaging and I used the end of a paperclip not knowing it was included due to the reviews!"
883,All I received was phone and charger in scratched screen cover. No info books and no SIM card.
884,Phone was as expected.
885,Went from 93% to 88% battery health in 3 weeks. Will be returning
886,"The product came in a really cute box, with a screen protector inside the box and a charger(not an apple one but it works fine) and the sim card removal tool. I’ve been using the phone for a couple of days now and so far so good."
887,I received it before the predicted arrival time and everything works great!
888,"Works great! Have had for 6 months now, no issues.One minor kink is that blue tooth will fall out all of a sudden. But that seems to be only thing, which is totally fine. Great purchase."
889,I love it even though I had to get a new SIM for it 😊so much better than my 7
890,I feel this phone is okay but had glitches and problems from the beginning!!
891,I am enjoying my iPhone 11 it is a refurbished one through amazon but came brand new and unlocked I actually am looking forward to upgrading through amazon to the twelve.
892,"all the bad reviews made me worried, but I ordered it, and not only did it come three days early,  but its beautiful and has no issues whatsoever, also came with a screen protector placed on perfectly! buy it :)"
893,i got the green 64gb n everthing down to the speakers is good so i gueess im one of the lucky ones ive been using tthis phone for 4 days now everything normal
894,Good phone good quality everything works fine
895,I personally didn’t have any issues when ordering this. It’s a great phone and I’m very happy with it. I have ordered phone from Amazon in the past and lucked out with them working properly. Ether Amazon is getting the better phones or I just got lucky with this one. I would recommend
896,The only issue I have seen with the phone is that one of the speakers doesn't work. Bought for my son he says everything else seems to work fine.
897,"It has some scratches in the body that makes it ugly, but still it works fine. Battery level was at 87%."
898,"Looked like new, has all the features."
899,"The phone was in great shape but Boost Mobile would not recognize the IMEI number, so it had to be returned. Return process was very easy."
900,It's not fully functional
901,So far so good still trying to learn the features on the phone but no issues phone came packaged well Thanks guys
902,Battery life is really good but not a fan of the charger that came with it.
903,"Will review after Christmas, it’s a gift for my granddaughter"
904,I know its refurbished but scratches on the screen.... ReallyThe one idea that can be scratch free has  scratches on it. And I was offer 20 dollars as a concession. It will be more than 20 dollars to replace the screen.
905,It's a good phone lots of features and functions don't think it's worth the price tho.
906,Phone came super fast and works perfect! Also it looks brand new. Battery life is a little eh but nothing significant. Overall very happy with this entire process.
907,"I love this phone. I give it a 5 star on everything. Fast shipping, looks and works great."
908,Great phones
909,I was quite surprised by the high quality of the device I received. It came in a timely manner. It arrived in a better condition that I expected. I’ve had it a couple weeks now and seems to be working well.

911,Purchased this phone for my sister and came in perfect condition. Like brand new. She loves it!!

914,We ordered this phone for one of the company employees and he is very happy with the phone.  The phone did not looked used or refurbished at all.  The quality is like a new phone.  Everything works perfect.
915,I like the phone and all but ain't loud enough. on a call is hard to hear and alarms as well.my wife has the same phone and we compared them and results that my wife's phone is way louder than this one. that's why I would like a replacement or refund. Thanks
916,This wasn’t unlocked and not compatible with Verizon. I will be returning for a refund.
917,Purchased thus phone for my daughter and she loves it. Not only does it look brand new it also works like it's brand new. My daughter only orders her phones from this seller and she's always pleased with her purchases.
918,Battery life sucks but other than that it’s a alright phone the 6 is better
919,"So right it's good. Given its refurbished, I understand the battery not being 100% but the only issue I could think of is the charger port. I'm having it looked at soon. Overall 9.3/10 would recommend buying most definitely."
920,Bought this for my sister in law and she loves it work like new
921,Poor quality. Couldn’t hear when making a call.
922,I think it should have come with at least 90-95 percentMine might be defective because I’ve only had it for less than a week and the and the battery health has dropped 3 percent.And I hardly even use the phone …
923,"Came with noticeable scratches on screen. Large enough to notice at arms length, unlike what is guaranteed in the product description. Sadly I will be returning."
924,Phone came scratched and after 10min of having the phone on the phone disabled
925,don’t buy Disappointed phone came in with broken battery connector which  makes it power off consistently every 5/10 mins of use I will look over and the power on screen is loading will be returning and not purchasing again
926,"I upgraded from an iphone 8, and I am so glad that I did! Battery life is long, screen had no scratches, minimal wear on the back side, and was fully unlocked for me to add my own sim card."
927,Delivery was fast phone had no imperfections it’s like it was new and I’m very satisfied didn’t need to call or send it back it was worth the money
928,"No complain, I am 100 percent satisfied."
929,Love this phone! Not a scratch or crack on it and the battery life is at 100%. Not a single flaw with the phone. Definitely would suggest!

931,Given as a gift to family member and they are very pleased
932,"El telefono funciona perfecto, reconocimiento facial y bateria excelente, tiene un detalle importante en una de las esquinas, pero eso no afecta su uso, elResto impecable, gracias"
933,Man this is great! Got this a couple months ago for me and and my girlfriend and they work great! Only problem was the chip for a boost mobile phone but you just have to ask for a new one and they will give it to you! Everything works fine and I recommend this! 10/10
934,Everything good about this phone.
935,Everything works perfect but unfortunately it’s not unlocked!!
936,"Bought this as a gift for my wife, no issues completely unlocked and worked with Mint mobile. Would buy again."

938,"Battery life good , phone operation great . Will purchase again"
939,Es muy pésimo el servicio 😡  el tefono  desia de era desbloqueado pero realmente no funciona dos beses que e pedido me a fallado que detección la verdad
940,Good quality iPhone 11
941,Looks like a brand new phone . T mobile here I come . iPhone 11 is what I chose to buy . The phone is nice . Really Nice . No scratches . Good Luck . Recommend Purchasing a IPhone Charger .
942,Screen didn’t work on a certain area. Either don’t test well or just don’t care…Second one received after returning the first. The speaker is broken and doesn’t get sound intermittently
943,"No scratches or chips, looks band new. I ordered a t-mobile one and the box said sprint but it was mislabeled. Definitely recommend"
944,like all
945,The phone is mediocre. It has scratches on the screen. And the internet just randomly stops working to where I have to restart the phone to get it to start working again. Other than that it is ok.
946,"The phone was in great condition, it did arrive a day earlier than expected. It also came with a screen protector & phone case. I got the phone for my son & he's constantly on it so maybe that's why his battery doesn't last as long, lol..but other than that, we were very pleased with our purchase."
947,"I always buy refurbished, but most importantly, I always buy refurbished from this company. I have been through two phones and both have worked AMAZING. Price is great and product is better."
948,Phone came in excellent condition. Battery was nearly completed charged and there weren’t any scratches on the screen. The phone was ready to be set up and was fully unlocked so I could use my old SIM. It also came with a screen protector on it which was a nice touch.
949,Came a day early so that’s awesome very small chips noticed but not enough to make the phone look bad. Battery health was at 88% so that would be the only thing I wish I would of been told. But other than that pretty happy with the phone
950,I love this phone. It was just like described.  Fast shipping.  Great quality.  I will recommend
951,"The phone arrived looking brand new. However the back camera is not working. I restarted the phone and it worked for short while, and then stopped working again. I recommend buying a brand new phone."
952,Liked the phone overall
953,Works just like it was new even came with screen protector.
954,"This one had the best reviews so I ordered it. Looks like a brand new, never used iphone! Everything works and my brother was very happy!"
955,Perfect
956,Great condition only the charger is not original meaning wont works
957,Looks new can’t even tell it’s refurbished
958,Phone works good but came with small scratches on screen. Not worth the same price as a new one.
959,"I really expected it to feel used but feels new, camera works, Face ID works, speaker work it’s amazing. Even though it doesn’t come with the original box and charger the phone is really. It’s worth the wait."
960,Delivery an issue
961,Bought this iPhone thinking it was gonna be unlocked turns out that it isn't waste of money and time
962,La cámara no funcionaba bien y la batería tampoco. Se devolvió el producto y aún no devuelven el dinero
963,"Great buy, works well!"
964,Charger broke first time used.  Otherwise phone is as promised and performs properly.
965,"This is my first time buying a phone from Amazon, the phone is in perfect condition besides the fact that the left microphone is defective. The phone does not come with original iPhone charger but it comes with a screen protector."
966,"The only thing wrong with it is that there is a crack in one of the camera lenses.Otherwise it looked practically new. It came with a case, a screen protector, a tool to open the sim card, and an off brand charging cable. Overall it was a great deal."
967,"it had some scars on the back camera and the side of the phone, and the battery life was only 91, which was way much lower than I expected. Besides these things, everything worked just fine, but still I wouldn't say I am satisfied with this purchase"
968,I got the phone with the battery at 87 percent battery health. It also came with scratches on the back. The camera was also a bit scratched. You get what you paid for though.
969,"Unfortunately, the phone is not working shortly after purchase. The touchscreen stopped working. After resetting it worked briefly but inevitably quit working again."
970,Works great! No complaints!
971,Nice phone but with bad battery that gets hot
972,Very happy with it.
973,"this phone is beautiful and came in perfect condition! they even put a brand new case in with my purchase! phone works great and no issues, love it :)"
974,"For 2021 the battery has been great, ios is always good and camera is more than good for the average user and very good at night. However if you’re on a budget get an xr for a lot less and basically the same phone with a little bit worse camera. Still awesome buy"
975,I recently bought this Phone came in 2 days and works GREAT!!!!!!!! No Issues At All
976,"Beautiful basically brand new phone. Works perfectly and had no signs of use, just very minor surface scratches (i really had to look for them, theyre not noticeable) great battery great price"
977,Great phone no defects. Daughter loves it
978,Nice iPhone 11. Was in great shape and acted like it was new! I highly recommend this product from Amazon.
979,Great product with great price
980,A+ would do business with again.
981,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Don't waist your money it's trash"
982,"Great condition battery Health at 100% what!?! and no scuffs not scratch’s on the glass on either side minus the light dust on the flash, I highly recommend if you’re thinking about purchasing a used iPhone 11."
983,I love the phone have had it for a month now working perfectly it was the greatest deal ever
984,Great phone but the only problem was the speaker that your suppose to hear out of does not work. Had to get head phones.
985,"The phone looks and works great the only bad part is that the battery came with a 85% of battery life, not 100% as I would have expected…"
986,"Honestly, if you buy it through amazon, it already comes unlocked, ready to use, and nothing changes about the phone's performance and its cheaper than buying it in the actual apple store (if paying for full price all at once)."
987,The cellphone wasn't working properly. I tried to call and people couldn't hear at all. They heard a storm sound... I returned same day i got it. Just waiting to get my refund. I don't recommend it.
988,After 5 months the phone started to glitch. The keyboard is bad and has to be replaced.
989,Ive had disappointing experiences in the past with other refurbished phones but this one went well. The phone came completely scratch-free and looked brand new. The battery health was at 97%; impresssive.
990,"It’s perfect! No scratches, no cracks, worked with my provider, and was charged."
991,Very disappointed and unhappy
992,No issues whatsoever i would recommend. Came with tempered glass protector
993,The description said it will come in a white boxThe item came in a plastic bag !!!NO BOX
994,"Came packaged nicely, and came a day early! Very pleased with this purchase! Thankyou :)"
995,This phone had me like wow when I got it but it didn’t come with an charger but it’s still a great phone
996,"I honestly thought this may have been a scam but it wasn’t and the package even came early. Everything works great and the battery life is 94%. The only minor thing is when I got the phone, it was on 2%. But I charged it and it was fine."
997,Love the case. Accidentally left my phone on the hood of my car and it flew off around a corner going about 20 mph. Saved my phone!!
998,Have 3 teenage girls and for the price I paid for their phones was still cheaper then a brand new phone.  They lover them and have absolutely no issue at all
999,Great phone? Looks brand new!! Works well!! Will buy from this store again.
1000,"Bought 2 of them, extremely happy with both, look immaculate and work great. Amazing battery life."
1001,This phone came with a non-Apple charger and power adapter which might be different and possibly not good for the phone. I would have preferred an Apple charger and power adapter.
1002,The Battery is sooo good the phone is little new to me so im still working with it but everything else is beautiful I love it and it was unlocked im happy with my product .
1003,very good phone came 3 days earlier looks like new to me
1004,Just received the phone yesterday it was a birthday gift for my granddaughter.  It was supposed to be unlocked but according to cricket it is locked!  What can I do?
1005,"Honestly, everything about the phone was great! It came with a scratch or two but I'm okay with that knowing its renewed. Would buy from here again."
1006,Excellent
1007,It has more updated things and easy to use.
1008,"Just got new iPhone 11 , upgrading from a 7 and it is amazing so far. Phone came in great shape and beats financing phones. A lot of negative reviews so was skeptical about ordering but seems fine to me . Go with your guy at the end of the day"
1009,I bought it for my son who broke his last one. He's very happy with it. It was in prefect shape and the battery life is excellent so far
1010,"This is a great phone, although we returned it for a technical issue. The customer service was outstanding throughout return process and refund, and would definitely do business with seller again."
1011,The IPhone is in great conditions. Very happy with it and no issues. I will buy my next iPhone here.
1012,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   En general bien. Algunos rayones pero nada importante. Creo que no perdí nada al comprarlo. Llegó de un día para otro"
1013,El teléfono no carga lamentable se perdió la garantía ya que se compró para un regalo y se envió a otro país donde al encenderlo no agarra carga el celular
1014,"That the worse seller , the phone is very small and when you return the phone they did not give my money back. Please I do not recommended anybody to buy this phone."
1015,"Me gusta que el teléfono esta en perfectas condiciones, funciona todo súper bien 100% de batería, como decía desbloqueado tenía miedo de eso pero soy de Paraguay y me funciona perfectamente con los operadores locales.. más que recomendada esta compra"
1016,He loves his phone
1017,The phone was not cleaned I was moving dirt from around the camera area.
1018,"el producto llegó con una raya imperceptible, no me genera mayor problema, con 91% de rendimiento en la batería, fuera de eso, impecable. liberado para todas las compañías, lo uso con Personal en Paraguay."
1019,Great phone came with a screen protector installed. Has a small chip in the upper right hand side of the rear glass which appears to be the only blemish on the phone.
1020,Outside of the fact that the screen is VERY fragile I give this a 5/5 ! It came faster than I expected only 2-3 days and was in perfect condition totally unlocked you could put any SIM card in
1021,"Great phone, great interface. Coming from android but just Apple has all the right features."
1022,I was skeptical at first but I really want an upgrade coming from the iphone 7 so I bought it it showed up and I unboxed it and I was surprised to find a iPhone 11 no scratches no dents works perfectly I’m using it right now
1023,Bought this phone for my daughter metro pcs activated it with no problem. She lives this phone
1024,"Equipment in good condition, with 100% battery condition, but it did not arrive in the color that I made in the order, I ordered a purple iphone 11 64Gb and it arrived in black"
1025,Todo muy bien excelente
1026,Great Buy! I love this phone! It’s in great shape! Works great! Highly recommend you get it if you looking to pay a used phone.
1027,Nice phone works great fast delivery thanks

1029,I was really skeptical of buying this phone but I’m so glad that I did buy it my battery health was at 99% and the phone overall just looked new it’s been working fine as well.
1030,I love this phone didn’t have any damages whatsoever not even a scratch!! Connected perfectly with my AT&T service. Only thing i would say is that it came with 83% battery health WHICH still last me literally all day! Would buy again!
1031,as expected
1032,Great product...looked brand new.
1033,Excelente estado
1034,Poor battery life... takes forever to charge and dies in no time. Very disappointed.
1035,I am Loving this phone! Can’t even tell it’s refurbished and came earlier than expected. I’ll keep you updated when I’ve had it long enough but so far so good! Clean and came with a screen protector already
1036,Good
1037,Phone works great. Got here early. Had a small issue with a different purchase and found their customer service is great.
1038,Honestly I am over all very happy with this purchase! Mine was in perfect external condition! The battery life is a tiny bit shorter than my previous iPhone but nothing crazy!I’m honestly very satisfied and happy with this purchase!
1039,"No complaints, just wished it came with a good charger."
1040,I have been on the search for a new phone forever and finally found the 11 and am so happy with it! i absolutely love the phone and the color!
1041,"Received a phone that could not be activated, returned it. After 1 month my credit card was billed  again… NO RESPONSE TO MY EMAILS… SHAMEFUL… BE WARE"
1042,Muy mala.calida la batería esta en un porcentaje bajo y el sonido es muy mal
1043,The earpiece did not work. I could not hear people when they called me. Speaker phone was very quiet also. Crappy battery life. Loved all other aspects of the phone though. Seller is giving me a refund - very easy to deal with.
1044,Tiene algún defecto de pantalla. A veces muestra el texto ( teclado) y otras veces no. Y hay que apagar Para que vuelva hacer  esa función. Pero le ocurre muy seguido
1045,Just like new
1046,I love this phone!!
1047,The phone is exactly as described. Works great. No issues at all.
1048,"It was worth the money . Fast shipping . It was also unexpected because it came in 4 days before the due date , came in perfect , I thought it would’ve been a scam . But it wasn’t ! Also it was delivered to my door ! It was great ! I do recommend to buy this ! Would I buy it again ? YEEESSS !"
1049,"It is working well, but the battery life is poor, spent very fast and take time to techarge"
1050,Love the look… but I had ordered for it to be compatible with an AT&T phone and it is not.
1051,i love it only thing was wrong was my screen i couldnt use letters left if screen paid to get screen replace but anything ither than that was fine
1052,Was a really good unlocked phone one thing I ask is if possible to tell which carrier these renewed phones were last on because I did a run around and found out these are gsm phones (tmobile was my carrier) but it turned out great! Brand new phone and not even a scratch. They were nice enough to even put a screen protector on it
1053,It took long to transfer my data but all is good. It has one tiny scratch but really nothing is wrong. It’s an awesome upgrade 👌🏾!
1054,Item not used delivery date nor honored as advertised even after 2 attempts and long waiting time to answer my call and request
1055,"It’s pretty good all and all, but I bought the phone on July 2nd and the battery health drains REALLY fast. I got it at 94% and now it’s at 90% which is pretty fast for an iphone."

1073,I have only had this phone a few days and I really cannot give it a fair judgment will do later . The phone was delivered early and in good condition
1074,Phone came in good condition except it wouldn’t make phone calls or text messages unless updated. The “update” wouldn’t allow the phone to update as well as not reading the SIM card. Upon further investigation it meant that the phone was unlocked but not the phone carrier. I returned it and I am still waiting on my refund.
1075,"El teléfono llego antes de lo esperado. Funciona bien todo, lo único que no me gusto es que la pantalla tiene dos rapaduras scratches"
1076,So I just got this phone in the mail and it’s telling me to type in a password. I’m extremely upset right now. What’s the password from the old owner😐 I’m..I’m just so shocked and upset. Don’t waste your time.

1098,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Phone screen is unresponsive. Hope the seller replaces. If not buyer beware. This is after a reset also.."
1099,"Do not buy these phones . They are not from the United States and stop working after awhile. Because they are from somewhere else, Apple will not service them (mine was from China). Just go buy from the Apple store. It’s the same price."
1100,"La pantalla tiene varias rayas visibles, no es lo esperado."

1112,"Batería al 100%, ningún rayon y básicamente nuevo. La mejor compra"
1113,"This phone was not working. I had to take it to the apple store to have it repaired at the cost of $200.00 dollars. I paid over $700.00 for this phone. The total cost of a new phone. Bad use phone, not worth the cost."
1114,I was a little skeptical at first cause of the price but this phone cause 4 days early and the batter was at 95%! No scratches or anything practically looked brand new.

1296,Battery could be better but at 86% i cant complain to much and needs less scratches on the back to get a full 5 star review
1297,Worst experience never buy a used phone it’s locked and can’t be unlocked due to the previous owner
1298,"the phone came like brand new the only flaw was that the battery capacity was at 88, it would be better at a 90 or higher."
1299,Phone arrived in like new condition.  Would never have known it was renewed. Easy set up with no issues.  Worked perfect with my AT&T SIM card.
1300,I was skeptical on how the phone would be due to some of the 1 star reviews but I received mine this morning and it’s amazing. It looks brand new and the battery life was at 100% literally nothing wrong with it. I’m so happy and it also came 2 days early
1301,"Me llego en perfecto estado, casi no tiene defectos estéticos luce como nuevo, la batería le dura bastante, la verdad muy satisfecha con la compra."
1302,"Phone was in very good condition. It was as advertised, very very minor scratches only noticeable when phone was up close, not visible at arms length. I highly recommend!"
1303,I love it! Basically brand new I’ve seen plenty good reviews and thought I’d try it! If you buy it unlocked you get it unlocked for sure!! Thank you
1304,Its a nice phone but it came damage half the phone screen didnt work at all couldn't tap on any apps or text. I dont know if whoever shipped damage it or it was just bad phone but im not happy
1305,Excelente condiciones
1306,Every thing is rigth
1307,Es perfecto 😻😻😻 la batería dura mucho y no tiene ningún desperfecto
1308,"I can’t say that there is anything I dislike about this phone. I do very much so like that it came with a screen protector on it, completely unexpected might I add. All together a great purchase well worth the money!"
1309,As the title says. Works fine but a lot of scuffs and scratches on the screen.Tried to cover them up with protectors but still highly noticeable.
1310,Dislike that I couldn’t hear hardly on the phone after a week of receiving the phone! Plus it acted as  if it had/has water damage !
1311,"Entiendo que el aparato no es nuevo, pero este daño no es menor. Espero al menos un reintegro parcial."
1312,"I like that it was here a day early, it scared me when the touch screen didn’t work at first, then by magic it started working when I said I was going to take it back. Been working since then."
1313,"Refurbished iPhone 11 is a quality product.. no scratches, very good condition."
1314,Phone was shipped with a broken microphone

1316,"Everything is perfect, only problem is when my screen is off I can’t see who’s calling. Never had that problem before."

1318,"I was a little bit iffy about buying it but I did and when it came in I wasn’t disappointed, I love it I have never had an iPhone before and I am very happy"
1319,The phone works great but they failed to mention that it won’t work with all phone companies. Fully renewed and restored they should put which companies you can use as a plan and which ones you can’t but they don’t.VERY misleading product.
1320,Product defective and would not allow set up.  It continued to error over and over.  Would not connect to Apple server.  Sadly returning item.

1331,"Phone came looking like it just left the apple factory, 100% battery life everything works perfectly excellent purchase"
1332,"My screen cracked after just setting it on my bed, after only a week of having it, so I had to go get it fixed and spent even more money.."
1333,"Great product, minimal details and everything works as expected"
1334,I opened it and tried to turn it on and half the screen was black and the screen was literally coming off I am so excited to get my refund 😑
1335,Phone works great. Has a few very small scratch on the bottom near the charging port but nothing that you would even see with a case on.

1338,Phone was expected. Very happy with it. Face recognition works well.

1341,"Great buy! Great price. So far, no problems to report"
1342,this was my first phone so I was pretty nervous getting it. But when I did I LOVED it! It even came 2-5 days earlier too. It has just been some hours but it feels like 2 months. The camera is very good. Would recommend buying it c:.

1365,Phone seems fine but was sent a USB-A wall charger and a USB-c to USB-c charging cable. Of course this phone uses the lightning cable so that was pretty worthless.

2136,"Got my iPhone 11 in perfect condition like brand new. Everything works great, battery life on 100% . It’s like nobody ever used it! I’m highly satisfiedWould recommend"
2137,Bought as a gift  for my daughter and it works like a dream. Great bargain.
2138,"I bought mine from Metro, so my only choices were black or red, went with black though it sits in a case anyway. Stuck with 64GB, but I don't use too many apps nor plan to keep photos/videos stored on it.As someone who has been on Android since the start of smartphones, this is THE time where jumping to iOS is going to be the most smooth, and you'll enjoy a few extra features. This won't happen until iOS 14, but once it's released, it will make this phone a great choice even for users used to Android.The phone, like many other phones, is a little too smooth for holding, which makes pressing buttons by accident a thing, so slap on a case not only to protect it, but to make handling better. One upcoming feature in iOS 14 is the ability to tap the back of the phone for your chosen options, so it's yet to be known if protective cases will get in the way of that functionality. I don't use headphones much, but it is still annoying knowing these phones no longer have an analogue 3.5mm audio jack. The packaging is top notch tho, and I've been using the screen protector it shipped with, even though I don't think it's meant to stay on the phone lol, but if it gets bubbles or just gets too damaged, I'll just replace it. It still ships with a ton of apps you may or may not use. I don't use a few of them and a couple cannot be deleted. iOS 14 will allow us to hide them tho, so this will soon be a thing of the past. Getting used to navigating the system doesn't take too long, even to an Android user. Eventually things just flow.I picked this phone because it's as good as the 11 pro/pro max, but without the telephoto lens, and still bigger than the 11 pro. I felt it was a reasonable compromise since I will rarely need the optical zoom capabilities of the pro max. The wide lens is something I will use far more since it comes in handy when you want to take pictures of a room and sometimes you simply have no space to move far back enough. That's the rear cameras, but the front camera can also do .5 wide, which is good for vloggers/irl streamers, especially if you ever need to include another person in the shot.Setup is ez pz and now you can import your stuff not only if you are upgrading from another iPhone, but you can also import stuff from Android, you only need to download an app to the Android phone for it to work.I haven't used all the features of the phone yet, but it looks like it's going to be a good experience, at least until Apple decides to slow it down to coerce me to upgrade lol."
2139,"I have been using a hand me down Iphone 6s plus for years. It was a phone my sister no longer needed to I upgraded from the iphone 4. I haven't felt the need to upgrade since newer iphones basically do the same thing except for the facial thing blah blah. I don't need all that and I actually prefer a phone that has the wired jack plug. Why in the world did Apple ever do away with that?!Anyways, I realized I needed a new phone with the Iphone 6s plus started taking really crappy photos and was just slower overall even after I changed out the battery. So I started looking for newer phones and a friend recommended Amazon and that a renewed phone wasn't a bad way to go. The Iphone 11 purple 128 gb was a great deal considering brand new phones go for well over 1100-1300. I had some issues setting up the new iphone (my fault with forgetting my encryption passcode) but I was finally able to get the new iphone updated, transferred over my data, inserted the Sim card, and it works great with Mint Mobile. No issues so far with Mint that I have seen yet. The back and front did have a few slight smudges however it was nothing a tempered glass screen couldn't cover up and honestly I don't notice them at all when I am using the phone. It is in great condition but the battery is at 85% so I'm thinking in the next 6 months to 1 year I will need to replace the battery.Overall, this has been a great experience. I love the new phone and will update my review in 90 days."
2140,"This iPhone is a really good phone, probably one of the best phones (at the time). It has a few problems but it is a solid iPhone.Camera: This phone takes really good pictures. It has live photos you can blur out your backgrounds and even up the camera to 4k. It has a nighttime mode where you can change your picture to look like it was taken during the day. It is a cool thing but the zoom in the future is not that good, it comes out blurry.Battery; The battery life on the phone was amazing after about 1 week of having it die faster. When you are using specific apps it dies quickly. You can go from 100 to 70 in just 10 mins. Also, it tends to burn up when you are using apps.Price: The iPhone 11 stands at about $409 and $521 Canadian. Before the price was a lot higher but with a price like this it is a must-get for anyone looking for a decent Phone.I compared the iPhone 11 to the iPhone 10. The build is the same, it looks the same other than the camera. The iPhone X takes a point for battery life. The iPhone 11 dies faster than the iPhone X. the iPhone 11 has a much better camera than the X because it has 1.71x more megapixels which make the camera a lot better. And if you are a person that likes to play games the iPhone 11 has a higher resolution, a fast download time and the CPU is great. So the iPhone 11 is Better than the iPhone X.The iPhone 11 is the same as the XR. It has one less camera than Apple's more-premium models, and its screen isn't nearly as nice. There are advantages to the Pros, but after getting a for what the iPhone 11 is capable of, spending the extra $300 is not a bad thing, it is really good and worth it."
2141,"The phone had so many dents not even scratcheS DENTS!!!! I paid$587.00, which is $12.00 less than apple sellig it for $599, I had no idea it was so cheap on apple, else I would have bought it from there. I am so disappointed with how bad the phone looks on the outside. So far software is good but other than that it looks like an old phone.  I would be happy paying $250.00 for a phone that looks like this not almost $600.00"
2142,"I purchased two iPhone 11s (New). I have always been an Android user. I purchased the iPhone for its enhanced security. Here are the issues: The glass screen often does not respond so I find myself pressing an arrow or icon several times to get it to work. Whenever I use the phone for a WiFi hotspot, it will disconnect from whatever device I am connecting to after a few minutes. Also, the iPhone is not as user-friendly as an Android. If I could return my iPhones I would do it in a minute."
2143,I am FURIOUS!! I bought this and NO WAY TO CHARGE IT!! They don't bother adding in of plug so that you can actually charge the phone! Their excuse to save on admissions? Really? Now I have to go and order one before I can use my phone that I just spent $600 on! They don't even provide you a way to plug it in and charge it! It's all a scam so that you are forced to spend more money to charge it once you get it! And I think that sucks it's a scam to rip off their customers if you want to buy a phone don't buy one that doesn't come with a plug. SCAM!
2144,This is the best thing ever can I please have a free one.
2145,The phone is actually near brand new minus the four scratches in the screen but other wise it’s perfect
2146,I got this iPhone for my child because mine broke and I started using hers so I got it and it came amazing ! I got the real package of apple and there’s no scratches so nothing to worry about! I recommend this iPhone
2147,"I had gotten the phone really early, it has no scratches or blemishes and the battery life is 90%. The box and charger wasn’t apple (but if you have your own before this shouldn’t be too bad) and it did have the phones information with it. It IS unlocked and came with a screen protector and sim card remover :) everything is nice and like new. I can’t say this is guaranteed to be for everyone but if you need something not super pricey this is the best seller, be aware not every phone can be perfect but if you want this buy it with some thought."
2148,"Tried installing the SIM card from my old Android phone, kept saying I had no service even though the SIM card was a known good and the area I was in was known to have service. Waited a few minutes, nothing changed. Either false advertising and my device wasn't unlocked (despite saying otherwise) or the 4G doesn't work."
2149,"I BUY ONE IPHONE FOR GIFT TO 15 YEARS MY DAUGHTER. I DON'T RECEIVED THE IPHONE IN THE TIME PROMISE TAKE MORE TO 3 DAYS AND THE PHONE NOT WORK. I DON'T HEAR THE PERSON TALK TO ME AND THE PERSON NOT HEAR ME TOO..... SUPPOST TO BE THIS GUYS CHECK ALL PRODUCTS BEFORE SEND WITH THE WARRANTY WORK, BUT NOT.... PUT ONE PHONE FOR SERVICE CUSTOMER BUT NEVER RESPONSE... SEND EMAILS AND TAKE 2 DAYS ANSWER BACK. BUT NOT TRY TO FIX THE PROBLEM, JUST SAID BACK PHONE,,, REALLY BAD SERVICE AND NOT TAKE THE TIME FOR FIX PROBLEM."
2150,"I got an iPhone 11 a year ago. Over the course of that year, it’s had countless issues. The display is discolored, the back is cracked, wireless charging isn’t functional, the flashlight doesn’t work, the battery dies at 70%, and the Face ID is tedious, and doesn’t work at times. TLDR: Avoid the iPhone 11."
2151,"Phone came without an adapter, dirt on the side and dirt filled speakers. Sim Port didn’t read my sim card either. Waste of time and money"
2152,By far the easiest scratching screen on the market. I have a $50 Lg fiesta with a more scratch resistant screen. Do your research and don’t buy this phone! You’re welcome
2153,"had i phone 8 plus loved it ,,,upgraded to the 11 , I WANNA THROW IT OFF MY ROOF ,, NIGHTMARE ,, it does what it wants even though i dont want it to"
2154,Description said phone was fully unlocked I took it to the Apple store because my phone carrier could not switch it over in my name and they told me the phone was listed as lost or stolen. Not only was it not fully unlocked but it was someone else’s phone...I had to get a refund.
2155,Apple store is selling new Iphone 11 128GB without a trade in 748.00 so a 714.97 refurb s not a good deal.  ( 9/23/2020 )
2156,"Just the BEST! Get this for ur kid, They will think ur cool if u get them this-Me, A Child"
2157,I received this phone two days ago and it keeps freezing on me. It’ll either freeze for a minute then continue to work or freeze and completely shut off. it has already froze 3 times while writing this.
2158,"My device arrived with the frame significantly bent. The aftermarket screen is coming apart from the frame. Device will not fit in my case due to these defects. I understand ""renewed"" devices are not perfect, but this one is complete junk."
2159,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   This is soooo legit😭I love it soo much it works perfectly fine and this my first iPhone ever I really love it omg😭😭😭😭😭💕I bought a case and everything godddd I love ittttttt . It came dead like on zero percent but I charged it up and I was so excited."
2160,"This purchase was an upgrade from and Iphone 6, love, love, love my new purchase!"
2161,"I want to help people out, the cost of this phone is crazy!!! You can buy a NEW one for less!! Yes FOR LESS then this refurbished one! Think smart yall"
2162,iPhone 11 is junk
2163,The seller charged me to return an iPhone whose face ID had to be refreshed constantly. Also the iPhone was not smooth when moving between apps. The phone is costly and you have to pay again just to return it. Who does that?!
2164,iPhone 11 black very good camera is amazing sound quality good thickness is amazing i’ve had it for a year and a half it is amazing thank you
2165,Within a hour of me unpacking my phone it started to overheat and the screen died this clearly shows that they did not take actual time to review the phone. DO NOT BUY! It is a waste when you can buy a new one for the same price
2166,This phone came almost perfect. Only this that was different was the battery health was at 89. But other than that it’s perfect. A little bit of chipped paint on the side but that’s it
2167,You can call someone and they can hear you but you can’t hear them. Took the phone to Verizon for them to checkout and they verified the sound was malfunctioning. I want to return it. Help!
2168,"This was amazing! Came in with no scratches or cracks, works amazing! %100 recommended"
2169,Everything is perfect thank you so much :)
2170,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Such a great deal on a phone! Worth the price although it had scratches on the screen..."
2171,Whyyyy you will not go to apple store to buy new on for 750? Apple store sale then unlock and new with original charger for 750
2172,"This was not fitable for me. It was basically broken and was used and I could not even turn it on! Do not buy, do not recommend"
2173,"Youd be better off buying a new phone from apple, these renewed prices are the same prices on apples website...dont get scammed"
2174,Does anyone use straight talk with this phone ?
2175,Es muy costosa para ser renovado
2176,Its battery life is pretty bad
2177,This phone is a knock off...not the real iphone(bootlegged)
2178,HORRIBLE!! phone turns off a lot even when fully charged. so not recommend
2179,♡
2180,I got it about 2 weeks ago and it worked perfectly fine and came in excellent condition. It was basically new just without the Apple box. Would definitely recommend!
2181,"Great phone only thing is better watch out for the glass back. Be careful when you don’t have a case. Overall great phone, 100% recommended."
2182,Love this feature
2183,"I do not like it , it came cracked , shattered . And locked .0/10 do not recommend."
2184,Arrived on time and exactly what I expected
2185,The phone is working great very satisfied with it.
2186,There is a scratch on the camera lens
2187,I am about to place the order for this item. I seen you guys reviews. So I.can't wait.!!
2188,yay
2189,I feel product is to expensive and if I would get a free one to test out that I would be able to give a better review.
2190,i was going to purchase until i noticed all of the comments showed the 128gb purple iphone
2191,Came with 100% battery health and has worked like a charm. Face ID is a major upgrade over Touch ID!
2192,The phone was delivered in excellent condition. I am very satisfied.
2193,Best phone
2194,Does it work with sprint network?
2195,Nice phone
2196,Amazing
2197,💯💯💯💯
2198,I Love The Product So Much & Take Good Picture
2199,Awful
2200,Was kinda skeptical about purchasing the phone but it came with a Fast charger! And the phone is in perfect condition!
2201,"¡¡Es maravilloso!!, batería 100% ¡Estado físico perfecto!, venía en caja original, incluye garantía de Apple y Apple tv gratis un año... Es nuevo en verdad, pero tengan cuidado no todos los vendedores dan estas maravillosas condiciones. Estoy más que feliz con el producto. Compré otro iPhone y resultó con una falla, lo regrese a Amazon y sin problema, da confianza comprar estos productos por qué siempre te dejan regresarlos si se presenta algun inconveniente. Quisiera comprar más pero este vendedor ya no tiene más disponibles."
2202,"I Love it! At first, I was very skeptical and prepared myself to send it back expecting to be disappointed. When I got the package the box said it was sanitized and the smell co-signed that 100%. The phone had no scratches on the body and was virtually perfect, only scratch found was a somewhat length scuff on the vertical half portion of the upper screen which seems to be fixable if some sort of adhesive was applied. With a screen protector, the scratch isn't even noticeable and the battery health was 100%. Got a 256GB for the price of the 128, I'm satisfied for now. I'll report any defects in the future but so far I definitely recommend this."
2203,"In the 10 years that I’ve owned smartphones I have always had androids. I had a galaxy S9 but I accidentally cracked the screen, so I decided to get the S10 on a whim. I immediately hated it. I’ve been just tolerating it for 9 months, and was prepared to just tolerate it for the full 2 years. But then I found this deal on a refurb iPhone 11!Like everyone else I was a little skeptical over it being a refurb but it came in excellent condition! The only cosmetic damage is a very small scratch on the screen which is invisible unless you’re really inspecting the screen.The battery life on this phone so far has been pretty amazing. I use my phone a lot at home and especially for work, the battery lasted almost 2 full days???? Not sure if that’s because it’s so new but either way I’m happy.Having never owned an iPhone before I was nervous that I would absolutely hate the ui but I got used to it pretty quickly! I actually really really like this phone! The display is a much better resolution than the S10 even though the screen size is exactly the same. The audio seems to be much clearer as well.I also really love the unique color! The pictures of it really don’t do it justice. In the listing it looks like a light grayish lavender but in person it’s more saturated. I’ve only had it for 4 days and it’s already gotten lots of compliments!Overall I really really like this phone so far and I really have no complaints. I probably won’t be going back to Android :)"
2204,I order this and found out my batter percentage was 86%. I thought they tested for faults and repaired them. Overall the phone is good and in very good condition. But if you are buying this as renewed from amazon make sure to check the price in apple's website bcuz apple is selling it for more $50 for a new one and if you have a old iphone like 6s which i did you could get it by replace for less than $560.
2205,"So I ordered 3 of these refurbished phones in total. The first phone, the screen shattered the first time it fell 2 feet to the floor which indicates the screen must have been replaced with one of the cheap ones. I returned it and ordered a second one. This time they sent the wrong color and the screen was visibly scratched pretty badly. I didn't even bother turning it on and just sent it back right away. The 3rd one I got had a big purple patch on the LCD screen like something heavy had fell on it. I sent that one back too. I went to the Apple website and you can get Apple Certified Refurbished phones for the exact same price as the ones here! but they're actually inspected and verified by Apple. SO I ended up doing that instead. If I could do it all over again I'd do that from the beginning and save myself the headache. It's a roll of the dice with these phones."
2206,"I can’t believe how great of a deal that I’ve gotten with this phone. I know it says refurbished, but I don’t see any blemishes or anything wrong with it. It has a lot to do with the Company that I’ve dealt with,The companies name is (buy spry) and they were great in sending me an excellent phone and in great condition. I would highly recommend this company if you’re looking for a less expensive phone but just as good as all the other ones that are out there. I’m very satisfied with this purchase from this company. I bought this iPhone 11 with my own money, nobody’s paying me to write this review. Again I would recommend this phone just Because the company stand’s by their word and will send you a great phone at a reasonable price.One last comment about this phone I included a photo of the battery life, it’s 95%. That’s great in my book."
2207,"I purchased the yellow iPhone 11 64gb unlocked and overall it is a pretty great phone. Even though the reviews were iffy, I still decided to take that chance. Once I got the phone it came with a screen protector which was a pretty good bonus. It also came with a charger and adapter (not from apple but works just as good). I did notice a few things that were definitely wrong. My ringer button does not work at all. It is a very tiny green dot in the left corner which isn’t noticeable at all and it honestly took me a few days to even notice it. It did disappoint me that I’m not able to purchase apple care for this phone but that is ok because my phone company offers a better deal (T-Mobile). I am coming from a iPhone 6s so this is a huge upgrade and it was definitely worth it so overall it is a pretty good deal for the price so if you’re thinking about making that purchase then go right ahead."
2208,"I’m so thankful Amazon offers the phone refurbished. I’m not spending $150 a month with leases and payments to these phone companies. With a family of seven and kids that want to keep up with the Joneses. Verizon offers a prepaid plan unlimited everything for $35. That’s right for $35 a month draft it out of your debit card or go in the store and pay. If you have your own phone you get the same service as I paid $150 a month for for $35. I cannot do that if Amazon did not offer these refurbished phones. Thanks to Amazon and thanks to whoever is refurbishing these phones. Please take my advice,Switch to prepaid and buy yourself a pair of shoes every month with the savings"
2209,"the phone worked well, but the face recognition did not work. I tried everything, but nothing and I had to send my phone to amazon to get my money back and I was left without phone for a couple of days."
2210,"I have always used an android phone. I find that the assumption that people should automatically know how to use an iphone is ignorant. I have struggled to learn how to use this phone right down to how to turn it on and off. I purchase it so that I would be able to do face time with my granddaughter. My sons have iphones. They don't live nearby, so they can't show me how to use them.  A little help goes a long way. I also find that the phone doesn't hold a charge for a decent amount of time."
2211,"So far I’m very pleased with the iPhone 11 I received. I purchased an AT&T locked phone because it was cheaper and I’ve had so many bad experiencing buying “unlocked” phones in the past that aren’t unlocked.Anyway, I’m upgrading from an old iPhone 6s so by comparison everything seems super sleek and nice. My refurbished phone came to me undamaged and I did not find any nicks or scratches on it, it essentially looks brand new. Battery life seems amazing. The seller even put a screen protector on it, which was a super nice touch and I was not expecting it."
2212,I love this phone. I’ve had it for a couple of months and it’s like brand  news. Good buy
2213,"iPhone 11 came in basically brand new and WITH a screen protector. Only thing is don’t expect a Apple IPhone box, it comes with a after market charger and little cardboard box where the phone came in. Other than that the phone is working perfect !!! I am very satisfied!"
2214,"SO FAR SO GOOD! THE IPHONE LOOKS BRAND NEW, NO SCRATCHES OR ANYTHING. SETUP WAS SUPER SIMPLE, JUST POPPED IN MY CRICKET SIM CARD AND I WAS ROCKING! I WAS NERVOUS ABOUT GETTING THIS BUT SO HAPPY I DID. I WILL UPDATE MY REVIEW AFTER SOME TIME , IT'S ONLY BEEN ONE DAY BUT IM VERY VERY PLEASED. WOULD DEFN RECOMMEND."
2215,"Making this review on my purple iPhone 11 💜 it’s the best iPhone I’ve used so far! It’s super cute and I recommend buying it renewed here and saving money. It has 100% battery health and this phone looks brand new no cracks or scratches at all. It has a great camera and it’s a better choice over the 11 pro series. It has been working well for me so far, and the battery lasts the entire day!!"
2216,Didn’t come in original box .... came bubble wrapped in a usps box with a charger and block ...HOWEVER ... it said this in description so I want surprised just want to state this.Phone was connected and downloaded from cloud all our old phone ... flawless process and so far so good!!! We did insure it would assurion add on ... overall great product!
2217,"The phone is like new. the only little blemish is on the protective screen, which I could replace. the battery is at 90-percent, the phone was shipped with a cable and wall charger, plus a SIM remover thingy. The only issue is that it does not connect to my Mac probably because I would need an original Apple cable."
2218,"GUYS THIS IS A MUST BUY GREAT PRICE AND BATTERY LIFE CAME IN 100% AND IT CAME WITH A TEMPERED GLASS,ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE MONEY"
2219,"La verdad tenia miedo de comprarlo x amazon ya que no vivo en USA, pero la verdad vale la pena! buenísimo, lo he exprimido al máximo ( lo he usado continuamente en google meet, clases, etc.) y otras actividades que requieren bastante energía de un celular en todos los sentidos, y tanto en la batería cómo en las funciones funciona a la perfección! Tiene garantía x 90 días en caso de que algo le pase, lo puede devolver! ENCANTADA, LO RECOMIENDO 100%"
2220,I love my new Phone. It feel so good to upgrade from a iPhone 6s to a iPhone 11.
2221,Checks all of the boxes. We all know what we’re getting into buying a renewed phone but I was very surprised with this one. Battery is at 100% even comes with a tempered glass installed perfectly. There was only one small little scratch but it’s very unnoticeable and the case hides it anyway. I was apprehensive but I’m very happy with what I got. Plus with Apple no longer giving charging bricks out the box might as well buy this.
2222,"Had it for about 3 weeks so far and i love it. It works just as i had hoped and was indeed fully unlocked...there were no scratches or dents. Just FYI, It comes comes in a generic box with a generic lighting cable charger and some manuals. All in all its a legit iPhone!"
2223,"It came in a really obscure android box which got me sweating a little bit but when I opened it, I was more than happy. It looked brand new. It came with a screen protector already on it and with the charging adapter and chord. The setup was good, and I’ve been using it for 2 months. The only thing I can say that was a little annoying was that it took forever to charge and the charger adapter stopped working which is an easy fix. You can always buy a new adapter if you really so choose which is what I did and I’ve been happy ever since. So if you’re going to buy this and need confirmation it’s worth it, this is it."
2224,Ordered a refurbished Iphone 11.  It came in excellent condition.  Not a scratch on it.  It's like new.  Everything works great.  The seller provided a top quality phone.  I'm very pleased and it came in 2 days.
2225,"I got the phone as a gift for my cousin who loves it. Out of the box she was able to get it to work with Metro PCS without issues. Talk, text, internet, she has had no issues. The battery lasts over 3 days without having to recharge (she is a lighter user.) Amazing value for an amazing unit."
2226,"I’ve had the phone for a month now and when I got it came in a white box, with no original charger box just a white cable and black generic box. After the plastic was remove the phone showed very little to no damage at all, very small scratches around the corners of the screen from past use but you can barely notice it with a screen protector and a phone case on it. The battery life was 87% when I got it but now it has gone up to 91%, but the battery is amazing and lasts all day. It is fast and reliable. Value for your money, yes. Fave recognition also is fast, the camera is great too, overall great buy"
2227,"The camera comes with three microphones (selfie camera, front camera, and phone talk camera) and the microphone for regular cell phone calls , located  next to the power input, had scratchy noise and people could barely hear me even since I received it. I did not have a phone  protection cover. I had to call Apple and after troubleshooting, they wanted $400 to repair. So I returned to the seller as it is obvious that they had not done their quality check.The only good thing is that I received my money refund fast, within 4 days of shipping the return."
2228,"Estoy encantada con el teléfono , en perfectas condiciones como si lo comprara directo en tienda, el cargador nuevo más es uno q le sirve al iPhone, muchas gracias los recomiendo"
2229,"The screen died two weeks after I bought it, totally died. They said I have to send to phone back and wait for several days, and they can send me a new one. But I have many data stored in this phone which I cannot just give them up and live without a working phone for a week. I repair it on my own packet and they refused to give any reimbursement or makeup. Disappointed, the screen change cost 130 dollar."
2230,"Looked like a brand new phone, no marks, smudges or scratches to be found.  Came with aftermarket USB charger and lightening cable.  Was cleared to be freshly set up.  I verified IMEI with Apple.  And had no problem porting my phone number to it from ATT to T-mobile."
2231,"Whenever I first purchase this phone it was because my dogs decided to chew up my iPhone X I had for 3 years. Everywhere I looked the iPhone 11 was $800-$1,000. I was very skeptical about buying a used iPhone off of amazon and whenever i unpackaged the phone the ""Smart Phone"" box it came in was all bent and opened at the top but surprisingly and thankfully the iPhone was perfectly fine, came with a full battery, no cracks or dinged places. And the transfer over with just my old sim card was so easy and hassle free. I am in love with my new phone, definitely with all my money!!"
2232,"I was apprehensive about purchasing a telephone online as I’m more of a tangible person. With that being said I did, however, order a refurbished phone from Amazon. This turned out to be one of the best purchases I’ve ever made. The phone arrived with not a scratch on it; looks brand new.  After putting in my original Sim card from my 2013 phone, everything just started rolling and no problems were encountered. Highly recommend purchasing this phone!"
2233,"The battery life is outstanding like it’s brand new! I did have some issues with the software but after it updated it fixed upon itself! The thickness of the phone is amazing and feels good on hands, and the sheerness of the phone is like it’s brand new! Thank you for the glass protector that came installed with the phone! I will be purchasing other phones from them in the future!"
2234,Received phone sooner than expected. Phone looks as new. No scratches that I can detect. Works smooth and quick. I really like the green color. All my other phones were the standard black. A nice change.
2235,"It came a day earlier than expected. Everything seems to function well. Kinda excited to use it. Came with no headphones, but I was aware of that. Already have airpods. So no worries. Looks really new and in good condition."
2236,"I really like the phone as a whole.  Charge holds pretty well, maybe just get some good charger depending on the charger it can take a little while to charge compared to my last phone.  Service is great with metro pcs. The camera is FANTASTIC! Serious quality! This is my favorite iPhone yet!"
2237,En muy buena condición
2238,"I rarely buy brand new Apple. I have always bought refurbished iPhones and they’ve all been great. This one from Amazon is no exception. It came in a generic box with a generic charger but the phone itself is great. Everything works well, looks beautiful. No scratches on the screen but a few on the back (as stated in the quality assurance). Cameras are great and so is every other feature. If you’re looking to buy a great refurbed iPhone for a good cost, this company does great!"
2239,I am very un pleased with my purchase . I received the phone locked ! I’ve spent too much time on the phone with my carrier trying to transfer my number onto this phone . They informed me that the phone was locked . I contacted Amazon after about 30 minutes they finally told me to contact the carrier . When I purchase an item I expect it to come as said .
2240,"This is not a spam, iPhone came like new and even with a screen protector however it is a little cheap (the screen protector) and also came with a white thick charger. Didn’t come in the iPhone box but it’s okay it didn’t bother me much. It was fully unlocked and like new like I said. I bought mine about 3 weeks ago and I love it. Also great camera. Battery life is pretty long about 8 hours if your mostly on your phone but charges pretty fast."
2241,"vino con una caja generica, el cargador y cable usb super genericos, y me vino con una raya en la pantalla es una lastima pense que vendria en perfectas condiciones!"
2242,Love it. Didn’t come with generic charger or box but it charges perfectly looks brand new and it was unlocked as well. I have t mobile and no problems. Very satisfied and well worth the price... can’t beat it. Also came 2 days early!!
2243,I bought the phone for my 16 year old daughter. The phone come in a day early and it come with a phone charger and a block.It was in perfect condition no scratches or cracks. I was nervous about buying a phone on amazon but I figured I would give it a shot and I am very happy with the phone and so is my daughter.
2244,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I was skeptical at first because of the bad reviews but I decided to try it out anyways. It got here today and so far has worked fine! It looks brand new and the battery health is at 99%. The screen responds to my touch just fine and there were no problems connecting my Apple ID. It hasn’t restarted or shut off randomly at all. There’s still opportunity for it to do something strange but right now I’m very happy with it! :)"
2245,"horrible quality, it looks like someone used it for 2 years and then decided to return it."
2246,"Arrived 7 days earlier then said date, came with Charger and cable, Had a pretty scratch on it but it dont bother me, battery life 87% came fully charged and ready to be set up, I love this phone a lot and would recommend it to others !!  I got the White One , Fully Unlocked 64gb"

2252,"Excellent , unlike other third party. Bursry selling devices in great shape without scrathes"
2253,At first I was  happy because the phone came with screen protector. How sweet! Then I notice there’s some bobbles under it so I tried to fix it. Then I found another surprise. The phone was scratched all over but with the screen protector it won’t showed. I was not happy about it.  Returned it right the way.
2254,"It says they will arrive with no cosmetic damage, but the screen says otherwise, dont waste your time, asking for a refund."
2255,Phone arrived very timely and was well packaged. Phone was unlocked as advertised.I double ordered the same phone by mistake and returned it. They provided a full refund so I was pleased.
2256,"The phone works great, it came fast, and works like it's brand new. There was a few scratches but that's expected with a refurbished device. The battery life was at 88%"
2257,Described as unlocked. It WAS locked.  Second phone from this company I returned.  First one died in two days.
2258,"I got this phone a couple months back and I was very skeptical being that it was used. You never know what it’ll be like till you have it. Worth the money! The face recognition is amazing and the battery life was at 94%! It had a little tiny scuff mark by the camera and on the screen, not even visible unless you’re looking for it, but that is it! I 100% recommend buying this product!"
2259,"Good phone, worth the price"
2260,"This is the best experience I’ve had with a renewed phone, it comes in anothee box and another charger (I was expecting to buy the fast charge anyways) it comes with a 96% of battery health and just ONE scratch on the back but it is really small, it comes unlocked (or at least you can use it with metro by t-mobile) definitely recommend! Great product! <3"
2261,Im not sure what's going on but we ALWAYS USE PRIME THIS IS BEYOND RIDICULOUS PLEASE RESEND MY DAUGHTERS PHONE... IT'S PAID FOR THANK YOU
2262,Excellent product!
2263,I got this phone so quick I needed a quick replacement I was very skeptical of buying a phone from Amazon and it is way cheaper than the ones at other stores and it works great I’ve had mine for two months now it works amazing and it also comes with a apple charger which works amazing as well and I will never buy a phone at retail price again especially since it came a whole week earlier.
2264,This phone was in perfect condition as of it were brand new. Looks great I could not be happier with my purchase. It was definitely worth the money to get it
2265,The Phone came quickly was able to set it up by myself with little issue ( very proud of that ) . No scratches looked brand-new excellent condition. A little bummed battery was only at 92%  but other then that its been  great for the past 2 weeks I've had it
2266,A gift for my daughter and she adores it.
2267,"Arrived on time, easy to set up.Great value for the price.Very happy with it"
2268,"First time ever having an iPhone so I was nervous buying one, but I love it. I got it in my favorite color and now I make fun of all my Android owning associates. Only problem is Siri gives me so much sass, but I gave him a silly accent so it’s all cool beans."
2269,"It's cheap to buy in the USI am very satisfiedI changed from Apple I-6 to I-11 and I love the Face ID feature of the new phone, it's really convenient."
2270,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Phone in like new condition as described, I have not found even 1 scratch on the phone. Fast shipping arrived sooner than estimated time given. Battery was well charged also. I was hesitant on the price at the beginning but now I feel it was worth the $$.. Phone works like a charm ☺️ Looove it!!"
2271,"I am so happy with this phone! I rarely write reviews but wanted to let people know my phone arrived in perfect condition, not even a tiny scratch, and it runs smooth as can be. It’s been a couple of days and so far so great. Thank you so much. :)"
2272,The phone came a day late. It was as described and seems to be in working order. It holds a charge good. My son is happy with the new phone 😊
2273,"The battery life is amazing! I went to bed one night with my phone at 25% and I played music to help me fall asleep which I played all night and it was at 20%! It only went down 5% that entire time! 🤯 It did come fully unlocked and CLEAN!!! If you are looking for a very nice refurbished phone, THIS IS FOR YOU!!!!!!!"
2274,"I truly love my phone! It is what I wanted. I cannot take a picture of my telephone as I’m on it, LOL. The phone is what they said and it is working perfectly well!"
2275,The phone was great until it just kept shutting off I had an hour FaceTime call and it shut off 3 times just gonna go back to gazelle way more trusted
2276,Used it. Sent it back. Forgot how boring iphones are. Went back to samsung.
2277,"i got the phone at 89% battery life which is way better than what i had on my old phone, and the battery lasts me all day long. i did receive the phone with one semi-deep scratch and a couple baby scratches on the screen but that’s nothing i can’t handle, i did get this phone a little over 4 months ago and still acts as a brand new one, since you do buy it used!"
2278,I was unsure of buying this phone but I’m glad I made this purchase. The phone works great and I haven’t had any problems with it at all. I’ve had the phone for three months now and nothing bad has happened. It’s very durable too. The battery lasts literally all day and it charges super fast. Best purchase I’ve made.
2279,Happy camper!! The best part of  cellphone is!!! You could connected with any network
2280,"When I first saw this I was so scared to buy refurbished but I do not regret it one bit. No cracks, nothing! Perfect condition. Came with a charger and charging box. Best purchase I’ve made on Amazon and super pleased :) thank you. The battery life is amazing compared to my iPhone 7. Really hope you make this choice too!! :)"
2281,I just received my phone. I am new to Apple products. I also just received my IPad. I will add more feedback later. I'm so happy
2282,Says for AT&T but would not work with my ATT sim  card.
2283,"Although the battery health is 89% I am over all satisfied with the phone. It looks new, no visible wear on the surface. The product works almost as if it is new as well. Even with the lower battery health level the phone was definitely worth every penny. The seller also overnighted the phone at no extra charge which was really amazing."
2284,"I’m OBSESSED with this phone!! The screen is very big, the camera is amazing, and it looks brand new to me!"
2285,This is my second purchase within 2 weeks.  Great phone. Well packaged. Arrived earlier than expected delivery date.  I bought as a gift for my friend.  I will recommend
2286,"I’ve been use it since April to make s good review and I think it’s time now so... I couldn’t love it more, it’s completely worth"

2288,My wife really likes it and I came with no blemishes or scratches at all. Great deal.
2289,It was great I got it one day before expected it didn’t came in the original box but it was great for the moment everything works great and the health battery is on 100 percent it was unlocked and it didn’t even came with a scratch I was nervous until I got it and saw it was good I’m really happy 😊 I recommend it

It came with a charger and SIM card compartment opener. Delivery time was great and I had absolutely no problems. You will not regret your decision.
2292,Good quality fast shipping
2293,The bottom right of my screen kept turning black so I returned it. They got my money back extremely fast and had amazing customer service. I would definitely recommend  buying from this company. I bought a different phone from them instead because I read that this phone is known for having the black in the corner :)
2294,I was skeptical about how cheap the price was however once I received it in the Mail ( which was fast and took one day without prime) I was very pleased with this order. Battery life is at 95 and sound/face rec/serial number/ unlocked phone is true. Even came with a charger and no scratches visible.

2463,I was so scared about buying a phone on Amazon renewed but so far I love it!! No visual damage and no issues as far as being locked or anything I’m very satisfied with this phone so far so good!!  Definitely will be buying from them again. It came with a screen protector on it already so that’s was a plus also. I ordered my phone on Tuesday and received on Saturday so not to long of a wait.. I upgraded from a 7plus it was well needed!!
2464,I’ve had this phone for a couple months now and I really love it definitely worth it then buying a brand new one save yourself some money it came with a charger and everything you need and a screen scratch protector over all I love this phone !!
2465,I love it it is a huge upgrade from my old phone it is so nice it was fully unlocked I got the case off of Amazon to and I love it as well

2467,Dislike everything need to talk to owner about it
2468,El producto funciona muy bien sin detalles perfecto estado
2469,Very Happy Overall
2470,Phone is great overall but was missing the SIM card tray. Thankfully it was just a $5 item at the local phone repair store.
2471,Looks new only time will tell
2472,Love it
2473,La entrega fue muy rápida muy buen servicio
2474,Had to put into dfu mode with a cable and my Mac to be able to get it to come back. Returned it and had to order elsewhere due to them being out of this model
2475,"I really like this phone. It looks brand new and works great. There are still so many new things to learn about it that I'll have a great timeLearning everything about it. It is the same size as my iPhone 7, but the screen size is larger, so it will still fit in my pocket and my purse."
2476,Mine came with 2 cracks on it
2477,"Waited about a month to write this review just to make sure everything with the phone was working right. The phone was pretty much brand new, I did notice a few scratches on the camera but morning crazy. Battery level is a 94% which is GREAT for a refurbished phone. I have T-Mobile & the set & transfer of information from my previous iPhone was great, had no problems. Phone shipped and delivered fairly quick (within about 3 days). Will definitely order from this company again. 10/10."
2478,IT IS AMAZING LITERALLY ITS THE BEST I WAS A LITTLE SCARED ABOUT BUYING THIS BUT IT IS LITERALLY THE BEST👍 RECOMMEND
2479,as far as ik of the phone came with all original parts the only 3rd party thing was the charger and it came with a glass screen protector that took away the scratches that was on the display but if u have it directly in the light u could somewhat see it but no problem it was like a new phone
2480,It came with 100% battery capacity and very small scratches on the front screen. Everything else was in mint condition. I really enjoy this phone and I barely notice the scratches with my case. The phone automatically comes with a screen protector which is nice.
2481,I was a little skeptical to make this purchase but the phone is in brand new condition!! I’m so glad I bought it and there’s nothing wrong with it at all. The battery life is at 88% capacity and the screen is perfect.
2482,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this iphone due to some negative reviews, but i went ahead and gave it a shot and was not disappointed! This phone works like new, good battery life and included a charger. I had no problems with this phone so far and it’s been about a month since i purchased. If you’re thinking about purchasing this phone, DO IT! Don’t let the bad reviews get to you, you won’t regret it!"
2483,"Bought 2 phones, one only had a scratch and works fine, the other ones ear speaker didn’t work at all had them send in a replacement but when I opened the box it has a lot of scratches on top and on the screen very disappointed after spending this much money on a phone…"
2484,Better than i thought was pretty scared at first but yes!!! NOT A SCAMMMM also i have 87% battery couldve been better but okkkkk
2485,"Phone came in good shape. No issues so far. No scratches, dents, or missing glass in the screen. Works well. Battery seems to hold pretty good."
2486,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Me llegó con 86% de cargaMuy buen teléfonoTodo funcionado al 100000%"
2487,Works great just like new
2488,"Phone was in good shape, fully functional but it's clear that the battery was never checked as it clearly states that the battery life warrants a replacement."
2489,"I was very skeptical about purchasing this phone online. However, the phone came in excellent condition. Not sure if was just my luck but the phone had zero scratches, the battery life is perfect (one full charge last for at least two days). Everything works fine so far. Hoping it remain the same for another year or more"
2490,It’s perfect! Worth it
2491,El iPhone 11 llegó bastante nuevo y con protector de pantalla incluido y esta desbloqueado valió la pena hacer la inversión y la batería esta en 89% de vida útil nada mal para ser un teléfono usado .
2492,"I was weary buying a refurbished phone but it didn’t have any marks on it and after a little over 2 months it still works great and battery life is 93% the camera, face id and everything work great. No reason to buy a brand new phone when these come so much cheaper"
2493,"Just got my iPhone. This was my first time buying anything in condition called Renewed, but I understand that it's Refurbished. It made no difference! I was really happy with the quality, it looks and works great. It came a day early too, so I'm really happy. Thank you!!"
2494,
2495,It came with 88% battery health and its not unlocked it also has some scratch’s present.
2496,Product screen is cracked!
2497,"The phone arrived within the time frame the seller stated. Looks great no scratches looked new. Battery life not sure yet it does last all day and I use my phone a lot. However I felt my Note 9 lasted longer.When I received the phone I had some hurtles. I had Verizon and wanted to switch to ATT. I took it to Costco Kiosk and they had all sorts of issues. My options were return the phone or try taking it to ATT store. Communication with the seller was outstanding! I initially did it via Amazon chat and then I asked for a phone number. When I called I got a voicemail and though hmm they are not going to call back. But they did, the person who I spoke with was fantastic. ATT was able to transfer my service without a problem.The morale of the story is don’t give up if it doesn’t work the 1st time. I am happy that I have an almost new phone with spending over $1000.I highly recommend buying phones through this seller!"
2498,"honestly it feels like a brand new phone, easy to set up and no scratches or defects!"
2499,The screen got a lot of scratches if you look Closely.It came with a screen protector to hide the scratches and when I took of the screen protector it was kinda hard to clean up and it got a glue like material.
2500,I ain’t even gon cap I was a lil scared to buy this thinking imma get scammed or something but it’s better then what I expected easy set up works and looks new
2501,"La batería al 100%, El Face ID funciona perfectamente bien, desbloqueado para todas las compañías, no notarás tanta diferencia entre este producto renovado a uno nuevo, vale la pena."
2502,"no puedo decir que nuevo , pero esta excelente"
2503,"El producto está en perfectas condiciones, la vida útil de la batería llegó con un 93%, llegó en una caja genérica pero muy bien empacado."
2504,Me encanto.. no tiene ningún signo visible de uso. por el momento marcha todo bien.Lo único es que el cargador genérico 👎🏽
2505,"DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT, the battery is beginning to swell and heat up, this means it’s now at risk of exploding and I have done research on why these phones explode. I know it LOOK good but don’t risk it!"
2506,"I’m so disappointed with my purchase. Sadly I couldn’t make the complaint or change vaciase I’m already in my country, I was in the US for a short period. The phone has two scratches on th screen. Completely disappointed."
2507,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Solo abre a una altura mayor a los 3/4 de la pantallaNo recibe tacto en la parte bajaAguardamos noticiasEstoy en Uruguay"
2508,"The phone was just overall pretty good I absolutely love it I seen a few bad reviews about the product but still decided to order it and trust me it’s worth your money. When the phone first got here it wasn’t letting my Apple ID sign in how to fix this is you, Go to settings, go to general, then go to rest and press erase all content and settings. After you do all of that you should be good!"
2509,"The device works perfectly. The back glass is near perfect. No real body blemishes or defects.But the screen has pretty harsh abrasions at the top left some of sort.Fairly sure my matte screen protector will hide this but never the less, this doesn’t exactly fall within “There will be no visible cosmetic imperfections when held at arms length” rule listed for the refurbished quality description.This is very visible much further, especially when in any sort of light source.Also the battery life was at 85% Health which is above the promised 80% so I’ll eventually just get Apple to replace it at some point."
2510,a
2511,Excelente producto
2512,Had this phone over 1year no issues. Just like new!
2513,The phone's battery is terrible. It came in as a maximum capacity of 77%. That's worse than my old phone. Phone gets really hot quick do to this issue.
2514,"Battery good,When I did insert the SIM card immediately workGood"
2515,"La vida útil de la batería baja, los demás va excelente."
2516,I've no problem with this phone don't read the bad comments 🙄 the phone is like brand new no scratches no faults everything is good
2517,I’ve had my phone for a couple months now and it works great. I’ve had no issues. It’s fast and the battery life is great.
2518,"Ok, but not great. First phone arrived with a scratch on the screen, so I returned and bought another. The 2nd phone arrived and the battery heath is at 86%, so I’m sure I’ll have to replace soon."
2519,Amazing go buy your new iPhone 11.
2520,"The microphone that’s used for speaker phone, FaceTime, and talk to text DOESNT work so that’s cool.... called apple to make sure it wasn’t a problem with the software and it’s not"
2521,"Exactly what I needed ! When I originally received the order, it did not come in the original Apple packaging, the box was crushed in one corner, and the package was extremely hot. I was scared since I have not had good experiences buying electronics second hand before. Despite the crushed box, the phone was safe with protective wrapping, and the distributor even added a screen protector for me ! I bought some glass protectors to add but now I don’t have to immediately open that package because the seller has kindly given me one. The charger and plug work good, I use my old Apple charger and have the one that came with this phone saved for travel. It has been a month since I’ve had this phone, and the condition is great. the camera quality is much better than my old 7 plus, and the battery life is also MUCH better. The color is very beautiful as well! I do sometimes find my phone glitching, but that may be because I run many applications at once and overwork the phone. All in all, this was a good purchase, although it was quite pricey."
2522,The battery health isn’t as good but overall phone is gret
2523,There possibly will be a couple small scratches on the sides but other than that nothing else is broken or scratched. I would totally recommend buying this and is such a great price for this phone. Also it’s very easy to set up and I had no issues with it so far!
2524,Every time they send a new phone. It doesn't work correctly. There is something always wrong with it. These are not refurbished phones. They are junk used ones
2525,"The product allows you to do and create so many things such as; Texting, calling, using social media, you can even create art and edit photos that you’ve taken with its Dual 12MP Wide and Ultra Wide cameras and so much more. This product is The iphone 11, created by Apple. Apple also makes other electronics such as tablets, bluetooth earphones, smart watches, computers, streaming devices and even accessories to go with these devices. I have had this product for about two years now, and it's still working perfectly fine. This product looks like the iPhone XR but with two caramers.  It’s all red, with the word “(Product) RED” on it. It is 128GB with a 6.1 inch screen size. This is one of the best iPhones Apple has created.You might ask how this product works, and how could you use it? The product is a phone so you can call out on it. You can FaceTime other iPhone users, you can also browse through the web, you can take pictures one, and you can text people. This product is very easy to use and if you don’t know how to use it they come with a “HOW TO” so you can get a good understanding of your phone. I have used this product to the max. I have done everything with this phone. For example, I have played games on it, called people, and texted them. I have also sent emails, plus I have done my school work with it.What are some pros and cons of this iPhone? Well some pros would have to be how good the phone looks. This iPhone was  one of the first phones to have two camera. This phone has one of the faster smartphone chips in it. Which means the phone moves faster and loads up thighs a lot faster. Some more pros are that it has very good video, and screen quality. The iPhone also comes in more new colors then any other phone.The cons are lower than you think. One of them is that it didn’t come with the new fast charger unlike the 11 pro max and up. This phone didn’t come with an ultra wide lens, which means that any phone that’s newer than this phone has a better camera. Some more are that it didn’t have any updates to the screen, so it’s still the same as the iPhone XR. And, lastly the phone only comes with 64 to 256GB, so there's less storage on the phone.In conclusion you see that this is a great phone to purchase. The two years of experience I have is letting you know what I’m talking about. The pros and cons help you understand the phone some more, and it could help you towards your final purchase."
2526,Battery life
2527,Great phone overall. Fast and responsive. Prefer iOS to android.
2528,I love this iPhone perfect size. Phone came to me looked like it was brand new. There was not a make on it and it works great.
2529,I am really happy with this purchase it feels like a brand new phone.
2530,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I uploaded a screen recording of how the video and camera jump around. If I use other apps it doesn’t do that - buying a refurb phone was a bad idea. Not a happy customer."
2531,Muy excelente
2532,Phone arrived in good shape except for the scrapes on the screen on the right hand side. It is very noticeable. Obviously this is a refurbished phone but cosmetic issues like this shouldn’t pass quality control. The rest of the phone works perfectly but the scratches make my screen look permanently smudged.
2533,I am really happy with this purchase it feels like a brand new phone.
2534,Love it but the battery life could be better!
2535,i’ve had the phone for 4 days now i’d say it’s a overall 8.5 out of 10 it came nice looking with a screen protector already on it and although the screen protector did break easily and the batter health was at 82% i still would recommend the phone the camera quality is a 10/10 the quality period is just great for a phone that is reused and used for community purposes i like it 👍🏾
2536,perfect condition. Exactly what i wanted for a great price!!
2537,"Excellentr product, my first iphone, only wish I had purchased the pro model."
2538,came brand new no blemishes and it came todays early even tho it’s not shipped by Amazon.  Everything works perfectly fine and it’s totally unlocked I changed company’s twice it doesn’t come in apple box or charger but they put a new charger I. There
2539,"It’s a great phone, but after dealing with my first one I bought on Amazon I’m still disappointed. I buy refurbished because it’s cheaper and better for the environment than buying brand new. With that said, I am struggling with the feeling now that I should have bought new! My first try on the iPhone 11 left me with a horrible battery and a scratchy screen. This one I hoped at least would have a 95% capacity for the battery. Instead it’s at 86%, so in the near future I’ll probably have to get a new battery for it. I’m starting to question whether it was worth it or not. It’s just frustrating because I had such a great experience buying my iPhone 6S on here. It should’ve been even better with such an upgrade!"
2540,"daughter loves it, was a birthday gift and so far so good"
2541,"It will not charge , the charge charges backwards . And it will die in maybe a 20 min span"
2542,Perfect in every way! Recommend this seller for iPhones.
2543,Came perfect condition no scratches and battery 90%
2544,Good stuff!
2545,exactly what i wanted!! just like new!!
2546,Very happy with my purchase!!!  Will recommend this company! 💕
2547,I gave this to my nephew and he loved it
2548,I am pleased with this purchase. The only downfall is that my speaker volume isn’t as high as my last iPhone 11.
2549,"This is my husband’s first iPhone and he now loves it. The facial recognition feature is great for him when he’s busy doing projects and cannot use his hands for the fingerprint reader.The battery life is very good, and I’m very impressed with how long the battery lasts especially for an iPhone.Also, the camera is very good and able to take very nice shots.This phone was for my husband, and I definitely want to look at getting one for myself too, now."
2550,I usually don’t write reviews but I wanted to write the review on this purchase because this phone is like brand-new and I love it. I read the reviews before I purchased it and was a little worried because some said the battery life was not long and it was scratched but I received mine in perfect condition and the battery is 100% and it was a great buy
2551,I received my new (refurbished) iphone 11 last week and LOVE it!  It arrived earlier than expected- boxed and looking like it was brand new.  No scratches or wear at all.  Transferring everything from my old phone was very easy.  I'm extremely happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend. I also like that Amazon offers a 90 day return policy in case there are any problems.
2552,The phone come exactly how they said it would it got here a day early it is in great condition and I am very satisfied with the product that I got
2553,"I purchased my phone from 'Buyspry' and there were very few scratches on it. It came with a screen protector already installed and 90% battery health, which is very rare for renewed phones. It arrived a lot earlier than expected and it's truly beautiful! I would recommend buying from 'buyspry'."
2554,Was not fully unlocked like said
2555,"I like this yellow one, it can be used as usual, good price"
2556,"So far so good. I bought this for my 16 year old son and it arrived within a week. It's a very nice phone. It came in really good shape couldn't tell it was renewed other than the damaged box and the charger it came with didn't charge it more than a couple percent in the 30 minutes it was plugged in. It arrived with a completely empty battery which was a bummer but my son charged it to 56 percent, did an update, uploaded his apps, and transferred all his data and after 2 hours the battery was only down 4 percent. He was really happy with it. And he said the camera was great. Him and his brother were having so much fun playing with the features. This is the second renewed apple product I've purchased and I recommend buying Amazon renewed to a lot of my friends. The great customer service and 90 day guarantee are really comforting. The phone had no signs of wear at all."
2557,Great!!!
2558,Love my phone it came very quick. No scratches are dents looks new works well I've had no problems with phone I don't do reviews so I can honestly say this phone is worth buying not a scam and also came in apple boxing
2559,Facebook and this is excellent battery life is great only charging every other day
2560,Awesome
2561,It good used phone
2562,Lo probare pronto
2563,Phone was in a very good condition only have a small scratch at the back thats barely noticeable...ordered a few months back and I haven't had any issues with it so far. Battery life was definitely what they advertised
2564,Phone came with a screen protector and in decent condition. Only scratches were paint around the camera. But pretty much brand new looking! Ordering another for family!
2565,"The phone was purchased to replace a newer phone with a severely damaged screen.  Simply moving the sim card from the previous phone was all it took to start working, all data transferred quickly without issue.  Cameras and all functions including face recognition work fine, battery life good although it has dropped slightly over time.  Meets our needs at a far lower price than a new phone!"
2566,phone is amazing looks and feels brandnew
2567,It doesn't come with 80percent battery but it was in fantastic shape I would 💯 recommend
2568,The touch screen completely failed and locked up.  Had to be fully replaced after 8 months.  Extremely unsatisfied with product.
2569,I bought two phones from this company for my children iPhone 11s for cheaper than I would anywhere else when I bought the phone none of the Chargers worked so I let the company know and within 24 hours they had a new charger for both kids phones next time I am looking to buy a phone I will be buying it from them and I would recommend them to everyone they really give customer satisfacture I give them 100 Stars. Thanks guys for making buying refurbished iPhone 11 for my children pleasant.
2570,GOT IT AN CRACKED IY SOON AS IT GOT OUT THE BOX ;:(((((((((
2571,I would strongly recommend and buy again!!! The packaging wasn’t its finest but it got the job done with no damage
2572,"I called my iPhone 6 my “smarter than me phone”, this one is so far above me, thank God I have a 14 & 22 year old grandsons who can figure it out."
2573,"Hice la compra y al día siguiente ya tenia el teléfono en mis manos, admito que sentía cierta desconfianza pero esta compra definitivamente valió la pena, me llego un teléfono en perfecto estado, parece totalmente nuevo, ni un rayon ni ningún signo de uso, la batería estaba en 100%, instale la sim sin problemas, y siempre tuve la sensación de que compre un teléfono nuevo. Viene en una caja que no es del celular y su cargador tampoco es original, pero, el celular es como si estuviera nuevo, recomiendo esta compra, gracias vendedor!"
2574,The I phone works great & our granddaughter loves it.
2575,At first looking at the reviews I was very hesitant to buy the phone but I took a chance and I brought the Red Unlocked 64gb 11 and I LOVE my new phone it’s just like new it came with a charger and a SIM card removal tool the battery is 100! It’s literally JUST LIKE NEW!!! Don’t be scared I don’t know about the other people BUT MY PHONE came perfect !!!
2576,Almost like new
2577,Phone looks new and works great

2579,Features are much nicer and the speed increase if fantastic.
2580,
2581,Came in with a crack on front face plate right corner
2582,Sorry I submitted a little message saying I didn’t receive it but it was in my mailbox 😂 thought Amazon would’ve delivered it. Product looks good though. Appreciate what you guys do keep it up!!!
2583,Phone works fine but if you have boost and try to use this phone it won’t work I switched back to metro by T-Mobile so that I can use it
2584,"To be honest I wasn’t that sure at the beginning to buy it but I don’t regret my choice, the cellphone it’s really pretty, works perfectly, it is fast and I haven’t had any problem."
2585,Very satisfied.
2586,"The phone came in really good condition, battery levels within the information from the description. I really think it was a good deal. Phone has great working condition.  Realized the phone was not unlocked for the needed carrier and because of that I contacted the seller. They attempted to assist and as it was not possible to fix it remotelly, they offered to replace or refund product right away and already provided the shipping details. It was a smooth communication and simple to deal with them."
2587,"Hola! Para los que estan pensando en comprar este producto, lo recomiendo bastante, la pantalla frontal y el vidrio de atrás intactos, viene con un vidrio protector cual también evita que se vean los defectos que pueda traer pero igual es algo que le tienes que poner que evitar que se rompa con las caídas, la batería me vino con 100% de capacidad y el FaceID funciona sin problemas, cuáles eran mis mayores preocupaciones, de la estética yo le doy 9.5/10, tiene tres pequeños rayones como de caída en la parte de abajo, para mi no son problema y no se notan mucho sobre todo por que es negro, igual la funda que le compre los cubren, estoy muy contenta con el producto, relación calidad precio bastante buena, te ahorras bastante a comparación del precio en tienda o a mesesViene en un empaque/caja pequeño protegido de bolsas de aire que amortiguan, para mi debió estar más protegido porque las paqueterías suelen aventar los paquetes, pero llego bien"
2588,"Al principio tenía muchas dudas sobre comprar este teléfono o no. Vi algunas críticas malas hacia éste y me ponían en duda. Sin embargo, lo compre y al siguiente día ya me lo habían entregado. Entre lo primero que quise ver fue la batería ya que muchos mencionaban que venía de 80 a 90 de capacidad y el teléfono que me llegó la trae del 100%.En cuanto a la estética le doy un 8/10, ya que tiene algunos detalles en la parte superior e inferior pero nada que me moleste (al menos a mí) y en la parte de atrás se ven apenas unos rayones, nada de qué preocuparse.Quedo satisfecho con la compra. Lo estaré probando por varios meses y si detectó algo raro lo publicaré.Pd. El face ID jala bien, la cámara igual y en las pocas horas que llevo de uso no se me ha trabado.Actualización: llevo dos semanas de uso y el teléfono se ha comportado a la perfección. La batería me dura un día y medio con uso moderado (sólo uso redes sociales y de vez en cuando veo algún video). También en cuanto a la carga creo que está bien. Lo pongo a cargar cuando está entre 15% y 20% y normalmente se carga en hora y media.Seguiré reportando camaradas!De momento recomiendo ampliamente a este vendendor ya que igual compré un iPhone X y tampoco ha tenido fallas e incluso llegó con estética de 10 y batería al 100%"
2589,"Estoy muy decepcionado con esta compra ya que el teléfono está muy maltratado y con unos rayones bastante visibles y sucio también. Para la calidad el precio es elevado, el modelo también es el que se vende en USA por lo que no es compatible con algunas compañías en Mexico. Ya lo regrese. Espero mi reembolso pronto."
2590,"If you're purchasing this from outside the U.S, the ""final price"" at purchase isn't the final price because the taxes and shipping fee hasn't been applied yet (it will do so once shipped, and then you'll see the charges in your bank account). This is not the company's fault, and it is something Amazon should make clear to their customers. At first I was upset at the seller due to my misunderstanding, but after communicating with them, they did their best to make sure I wasn't dissatisfied with the transaction. Before leaving a negative review, message the seller and I'm sure they'll try to help you out, especially if you're unsure about some of the details in their advertisement.The seller delivers on promise on what the phone comes with (although a nitpick, the battery was not near 80 percent). The screen has a noticeable scratch, which was to be expected. The delivery was quick and came next day. Mine came with freebies such as a screen protector and phone case. This product is worth the money, in my opinion."
2591,"Al comprar un reacondicionado esperaba aunque fuera una mínima marca de uso y ahora que recojo el teléfono me llevé una sorpresa: está NUEVO. No tiene una sola marca de uso, literal nada. La batería viene al 100% de la salud. La herramienta U3 le da un score de 100 ya que no tiene NI UNA SOLA PIEZA CAMBIADA. De hecho, indica que sólo se ha cargado en 9 ocasiones (de las cuales 2 son mías). El vendedor fue BuySPRY, por lo que busqué, es una empresa que se dedica a los renewed, recomendaría que hicieran la compra con el mismo.El cargador, tal como lo indica la publicación, no es el original pero sí está certificado.Feliz porque me ahorré $4,500 y al final terminé recibiendo un teléfono nuevo sólo que con otra caja."
2592,"Al ser un producto reparado o reacondicionado, tiene uno que otro defecto. En mi caso no hay detalles a menos que se revise a consciencia. El dispositivo funciona muy bien. No se si todos los dispositivos que envían tengan protección de pantalla. Le da un poco de plus ese detalle. Aunque  a la luz del sol opaca la pantalla. Otra cosa que debes tener en cuenta. Es que viene sin accesorios. De antemano debes comprar al menos un cable de datos y un cargador. Un detalle a considerar en mi caso es que se pierde la conexión con la computadora. Aun no se si es problema de hardware o software."
2593,"NO COMPREN! ME LLEGO LA CAJA VACIA. Me llego la caja vacia, si bien ya sabia que venia en una caja generica y no la de iphone la caja generica venia con el sello violado y venia completamente vacia, sin cargador, ni celular. Ya levante el reclamo con amazon esperando a que me regresen el dinero. Afortunadamente al sentir la caja con muy poco peso hice un video de unboxing para tener evidencia. EVITENSE LA PENA Y COMPREN EN UN ÑUGAR AUTORIZADO APPLE"
2594,"money well wasted !! no scratches or cracks, came with 80% battery it’s like new!! so far so good. my SIM card worked and it’s great! I got the purple one!! I RECOMMEND"
2595,"Llego en tiempo, cargador genérico, manuales y celular con estética de 10. Jamás había comprado un producto reacondicionado pero lo recomiendo 100%"
2596,"Siempre que cambio de iPhone los compro reacondicionados ya que hasta ahora había tenido muy buenas experiencias y al final me ahorro bastante dinero, con este equipo todo hubiera estado perfecto de no ser porque traia una pequeña raya en la pantalla la cual trataron de ocultar poniéndole un Glass encima, aun así se aprecia a contraluz, no afecta la función por eso no vi la necesidad de regresarlo, pero tengan en cuenta que es lo que se exponen con estos equipos. Hasta ahora 4 meses de uso y funciona excelente."
2597,"El iphone esta nuevo, no tiene rayaduras, la batería esta al 100%, en términos generales muy satisfecho con la compra."
2598,Love love love it!!Little expensive (but cellphones are)Totally worth it to me though!I am very very happy with my new iPhone!No scratches and looks brand new to me!
2599,"Me mandaron solo los accesorios y el teléfono nunca llegó, si reciben el paquete y no pesa nada ni lo abrán así soliciten la devolución sé los roban en el. Camino"
2600,"Me llegó el celular al siguiente día que lo ordené. La estética es de 10, no tiene ningún detalle, la bocina se escucha muy bien. La capacidad máxima de la batería es de 93%. Los accesorios son genéricos y sin auriculares (tal cual como dice en la descripción) y venía con la mica de pantalla."
2601,"El iphone llegó pronto y en excelentes condiciones, el problema fue al momento de usarlo, llevo 3 veces que se apaga sin razón, la pantalla se queda negra y no inicia después del reinicio forzoso. Inicia solo después de unas horas."
2602,"A diferencia de la publicación que dice que es reacondicionado el celular es RECONSTRUIDO, la gran diferencia es que los componentes con los que reconstruyeron el iPhone no son originales (batería, pantalla, lentes de cámara) por que aunque el software del iPhone indique que tiene un 90% de vida útil solo dura unas 4-6 horas."
2603,iPhone que venía con marcas visibles de uso al hacer llamadas se calentaba de sobre manera que hasta el sistema mandaba mensaje de emergencia se tuvo que devolver
2604,"Le realice la compra a mi hermana y desafortunadamente tuvo problemas con el equipo, intermitente se le apagaba el equipo sin motivo alguno y aunque sea el único detalle es bastante incómodo. Por esta razón realicé el proceso de devolución.Hay equipos que parecen nuevos a pesar de ser renewed y no presentan ninguna falla, para mi mala suerte no fue así."
2605,"Creo que tuve mucha suerte y me enviaron un equipo prácticamente nuevo, la estética es del 10, no tiene ni un rayón. El cargador es genérico y la caja no es la original (obviamente). La caja no avisa que hay un producto electrónico adentro y eso me preocupó un poco porque puede influir en el manejo del empaque cuando te lo envían pero llegó bien afortunadamente. Es la primera vez que compro un teléfono reacondicionado (renewed) y la vdd estoy muy satisfecho."
2606,"El celular llegó en perfectas condiciones, en una caja genérica al igual que el cargador (como se especifica en la compra). El iPhone no tiene ningún daño, ni rayones, la batería está al 93%. Estoy muy satisfecho con la compra."
2607,"¡Estoy fascinada! Equipo como nuevo, me llegó en excelentes condiciónes, ningún rayón, batería al 100% me encantó.Pero veo que después de mi compra subió el precio! 😳 pero en general, me está funcionando de maravilla !  Actualizare después de un tiempo de uso."
2608,"For 700.00, I expected the presentation to be more than a cheap dollar store box and the phone inside one layer of bubble wrap. It didn’t even have paper padding in the Amazon box to cushion the flopping around during delivery. And it’s a gift!! I bought one here 3 years ago and it arrived in an IPhone box and had protective coating on the phone like new. It was a great experience and great phone. This thing looks like it was tossed in bubble wrap with a sticker on the back. I could have done better on Kijiji. I’m returning it."
2609,"Se envió súper rápido, estéticamente como nuevo, incluso venía con mica en la pantalla principal, la capacidad es la indicada (256gb) y la batería está al 100%"
2610,"nuevo el teléfono no lo pude creer, impecable la presentación.  Estoy muy satisfecho.  muy contento.  vino en caja autorizada y sellada....impecable estoy enamorado  la batería se mantiene a 100"
2611,"Prácticamente nuevo, estética 10/10Batería 🔋 100%Lo recomiendo.Cargador genérico cómo viene en la descripción."
2612,"Tenia mucha curiosidad respecto a los teléfonos Apple, siempre había pensado en adquirir uno pero me quedaba la duda, sobre todo por el precio. Me decidí por adquirir un equipo reacondicionado para que no resultara un gran desembolso. Vaya sorpresa que me llevé al ver un celular impecable!!! cero rayones, cero golpes, o algún daño visible en pantalla, se ve como nuevo. El único detalle -si es que cuenta como tal- es que el estado de la batería marca 95% según veo las reseñas eso ya es secundario, además de que todas las especificaciones y software funcionan al 100%. Quizá corrí con suerte, estoy muy satisfecho con mi compra."
2613,"Actualización: se hizo válida la garantía y el equipo se ha regresado, ya que la batería si bajo su condición. Excelente equipo, la estética es muy buena, apenas tiene unas marcas y en la parte trasera, pero no es nada que afecte su funcionamiento. El teléfono llego en una cajita genérica muy bien protegido, punto a favor trae un cargador genérico nuevo y el paquete llego un día antes.Punto en contra, el estado de la batería no fue el mejor, el domingo que llegó el equipo estaba en 88% y hoy jueves ya está en 84% , lo sigo monitoreando, para en dado caso, contactar al vendedor: INNOVA LOHER"
2614,"Producto casi nuevo, sin rayones, batería 100%.. actualizaré en algunos meses"
2615,"Lo compré en febrero del 2021 y estaba muy contenta, no tenía rayones ni golpes, todo bien y como 5,000 pesos más baratos que el nuevo. Lo primero que Noté es que la batería no le duraba tanto, pero es algo con lo que tenia que lidiar, porLo que me había ahorrado, en Abril del 2021 me lleve el susto de mi vida! De un rato a otro se le desactivó el wifi y jamás volvió a encender! La garantía es de 30 días y ya habían pasado 2 meses! Me sentía súper mal pues ya no tiene arreglo, en la tienda me cobraban 8 mil por repararlo :( y en otros locales como 3 mil pero no daban garantía que quedara, ya que es una pieza muy sensible! Trate de comunicarme con Amazon pero no es posible, luego recordé que el producto es Reacondicionaso en EUA, entonces los gringos siempre dan garantía de sus productos y son amables y atentos con el cliente, me comuniqué con ellos a través de inbox (fb) y me facilitaron todo, envíe de nuevo el teléfono pues ellos tenían que corroborar que no se me haya caído o golpeado (cosa que no me había pasado) lo valoraron y me regresaron todo el dinero completo! Pero lleve el susto de mi vida por qué pensé que no iba a recuperar mi dinero :( al final compré uno nuevo pero ya en una tienda al precio normal. Dudo que vuelva a comprar un artículo de esta magnitud reacondicionado, no vale laPena!"
2616,"Tenía mis dudas de comprarlo. Pero me sorprendió el estado del iphone 11. Un leve, muy leve detalle en la parte donde se inserta el cable para cargar. Vida de batería 100%, impecable del resto del teléfono. Parecía prácticamente nuevo de tienda.4 días después de recibirlo, funciona perfectamente. Solo el ID Face, como que a veces le cuesta detectar, será cosa de recalibrarlo y probar.Incluye ya pegado un cristal protector para la pantalla muuy útil.Sin duda volvería a comprar a este vendedor ya que también llegó antes de lo esperado.Muuy satisfecho."
2617,"Ordene un iPhone 11 de 256 gb, y me llego un iPhone 11 de 128gb, ese fue el único detalle además que pagué extra por esa capacidad como 1500 mxn, de ahí en fuera el celular está en excelente estado como nuevo, batería con 100 de capacidad, sin rayones, ni golpes, se compró con buyspry"
2618,"Ya había comprado un iphone 8 con este vendedor BuySpry y todo bien, en excelente estado. El iphone 11 de 128gb que compré llegó en perfecto estado, estética 9.5/10, pila 95% y el aparto en excelente estado, facetime bien y llamadas por WS/Social, pero al tratar de hacer llamadas por red (Telcel o AT&T) sí conectaba pero al momento de contestar no se escuchaba nada ni me escuchaban, hice todos los pasos de apple pero nunca funcionó la llamada en red, una pena porque todo lo demás estaba bien. Ya hice la petición de la devolución y reembolso, espero que todo esté bien con esta parte."
2619,"Hasta ahora que tengo un mes usándolo me ha salido bueno .Me llego en caja genérica y accesorios igual , y traía mica en la pantalla , pero así me ha servido muy bien"
2620,"Realize la devoluciÓn y dicen que les enviÉ otro teléfono, abajo esta mi reseña original.Funciona bien, pero la pantalla está rayada como con un cuchillo incluso se siente al tacto, la herramienta para sacar el chip viene suelta dentro la caja puede llegar a salir de ella, y además en este caso venía torcida, mejor utilice una que ya tenía, la batería viene con un 80% de su capacidad original. Si andan apurados igual y si les funciona pero la verdad mejor junten otros 4000 y se compran uno nuevo"
2621,"Se supone que los iPhone tienen que llegar “como nuevos”.No es la primera vez que compro artículos así pero la primera vez que me decepciona.Empaque: súper chafa, llegó maltratado y de la calidad más barata.Estética: NO parece nuevo. Tiene la pantalla más dañada que el iphone que use durante 2 años.Los accesorios genéricos también era la opción más barata, se nota en la calidad (hah muchas marcas económicas pero de mejor calidad).Producto: el iPhone si funciona bien (hasta ahora) no he notado ningún problema."
2622,"El dispositivo me fue entregado en óptimas condiciones. Funciona perfectamente y pude configurarlo como se hace con un iPhone nuevo. Aunque llegó en un empaque y accesorios genéricos, todo funciona bien."
2623,"Creo que compraré más seguido Renewed jeje, mi Iphone me toco con 100% de batería pese a que lo actualice para que se corrigiera el gap que provocaba lecturas erróneas en la batería, solo venia con una rayoncito tan pequeño que solo muy de cerca se nota, el resto del equipó super cuidado, eso sí sigue siendo un Iphone, la cámara es excelente y la razón por la cuál elegí el 11 y no el 12, pero como siempre la batería no rinde como me rendía mi otro cel. Ojo, al ser de re-uso no podrás contratar el Apple Care+, Recomiendo Renewed anímense, total, sale mal les hacen cambio o regresan su dinero, ¿Qué podrían perder?"
2624,Bought this for a Christmas Gift.  Works and looks great. I ordered a second one and they were three small pinhead scratches on the edges. There was a long scratch along the back but not bad. The Sim card tray was a little hard to get out. The phone itself works very good and for the price I can’t complain. I would have posted pictures but Amazon of course wants access to all your photos which they don’t need. What I purchase another phone if I had to? Yes
2625,"El celular viene en excelentes condiciones, la verdad es que ni sé que es lo que está ""reacondicionado"" porque la batería, la pantalla, las cámaras, el funcionamiento y todo está como nuevo.A mi me llego de estética 10/10. Viene con un cargador genérico, pero de buena calidad y la caja tampoco es original (cosa que no me molesta a mi).Me parece una muy buena opción para conseguir un buen celular sin tener que gastar los precios elevadísimos de los distribuidores oficiales."
2626,"El iPhone llega en una caja genérica, pero bien empacado y con su garantía.El único detalle que tiene es un rayón MUY pequeño en la parte de abajo, por donde está el puerto lightning.La capacidad de la batería está al 100% y la pantalla viene con protector ya puesto.La descripción dice que el cargador es certificado por Apple pero no sé si creería esto. No sé cómo funciona la certificación, entonces es probable que solo me esté dejando llevar por la apariencia. Es USB A a lightning en lugar de USB C a lightning."
2627,"Me fue bien, la vida de la pila llego al 100% pero rapidamente bajo al 93% y hasta el momento se ha mantenido así.Estéticamente solo tiene un par de rayones pero nada importante o que afecte el funcionamiento."
2628,"lo recomiendo, solo por unos pequeños detalles estéticos que no modifican el funcionamiento del teléfono, los cuales se logran desaparecer con la funda, mi equipo traía mica protectora y cargador no muy estético pero funcional y de buena calidad"
2629,"Llegó en tiempo y forma.La batería al 100%, solo un pequeño golpe, muy chico, que no afecta en nada en la funcionalidad, carga y mantiene la carga super bien, me dura mas de 12 horas."
2630,"El equipo llego muy rápido y al abrirlo tenía colocada un protector de cristal colocado en la pantalla, compre un protector de alta calidad para proteger el equipo, al retirar la mica protectora (la carcasa no encajaba por el vidrio protector) nos percatamos que bajo el vidrio había otro “plástico” que se desprendió parcialmente y al retirarlo nos percatamos que la pantalla del teléfono estaba extremadamente rayada (adjunto fotografías), los rayones eran muy visibles a más de dos metros de distancia, parece como si el teléfono hubiese sido tallado contra el pavimento, entiendo que es un equipo usado pero creo que por el costo la pantalla debería estar bien, aclaro que el teléfono tenía un pequeño golpe en una esquina y no lo regresamos por ese detalle. Mi inconformidad es que en la descripción del equipo debería aclarar que la pantalla pudiera estar rayada y que el protector de cristal no debe ser retirado para que no se vean y sientan los rayones así mismo el precio debería ser mucho menor. En resumen si compran estos equipos usados exijan que NO tengan micas colocadas para que puedan comprobar el verdadero estado del teléfono. Queríamos ser amigables con el medio ambiente y comprar un equipo reciclado pero por el costo beneficio ahora tenemos que optar por un equipo nuevo. Que decepción."
2631,"La verdad dudaba mucho en adquirirlo, pero rebasó mis expectativas. Lo recomiendo ampliamente. Acorde a su estética está al 99% solo tiene unos rayoncitos muy pequeños que se perciben a contraluz. Y un poco raspadito en los botones. Pero de ahí en fuera jala súper bien!Habrá que esperar los 90 días, pero yo creo que todo marchará súper bien.Amo Amazon!"
2632,Éste celular me encantó a pesar de ser un producto renovado jala Super bien me llevo con el 87% de la batería no he tenido ningún problema no me ha fallado funciona súper bien estoy muy contenta con la compra lo recomiendo 🤩 llevo dos meses de uso sin detalles
2633,"Teníamos muchas dudas de comprarlo, siempre habíamos sido de comprar directo con Apple, pero realmente me impresionó, el equipo está prácticamente nuevo, funcionamiento al 100%. Ojo pueden tener alguno detalles, pero imperceptibles, no viene empacado en caja original ni con accesorios, pero ciertamente no hace ninguna diferencia porque trae accesorios de buena calidad."
2634,"Tenia mis dudas sobre comprar un producto reacondicionado, pero tome el riesgo y quede bastante satisfecho! me llego con la pila al 95% y ningun rayon en la pantalla. Si acaso tenia unos pequeños raspones en la parte inferior donde se carga pero no se veian a simple vista. El cargador tiene el Certificado y funciona bastante bien, aunque opte por comprar su cargador original. En Conclusion, se los recomiendo bastante por el precio que pagas, y con amazon tienes la garantia de 90 dias ante cualquier falla o no estar satisfecho! llevo 2 semanas de uso aproximadamente y hasta ahora todo correcto, lo volveria comprar sin problemas o por lo menos tomare en cuenta esta opcion cuando quiera cambiar de celular! Vale la pena animarse por la garantia que dan,"
2635,"Como dice el producto, es re acondicionado, así que no te llegará un producto “nuevo”. Pero la verdad es que solo le hace falta la caja original de Apple y no habría diferencia. La pila se encontraba al 98%, NO tenía ni un solo rayón en el teléfono, además incluía una mica protectora y el dock, algo que ni los iPhones nuevos de Apple traen"
2636,"El teléfono está sin ningún tipo de falla estética y funcionamiento, prácticamente nuevo. Batería al 100%.Llegó en caja genérica así como también el cable y el cargador. Para mí no es “big deal”, hay muchas más opciones allá afuera que puedan sustituir los que vienen.Muy satisfecho por el precio y lo comprado. Recomendado."
2637,El teléfono no tenía ni un rayón. El problema fue cuando le metí la sim y comenzamos a hacer pruebas. En las llamadas se escuchaba la voz como robot. Como que tenía una falla interna que no lograba tener un audio correcto. Lamentablente lo tuve que regresar.
2638,"Francamente tenía dudas al comprar este iPhone y tener algún problema ya sea en apariencia o funcionamiento, fue una sorpresa para mi que es imperceptible la diferencia frente a un equipo nuevo"
2639,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   No venía en su caja original, el cargador es genérico y aparte de todo está súper rayado de la pantalla quisieron ocultarlo con la mica, quiero una solución con este artículo de baja calidad"
2640,"Estaba muy dudoso de comprarlo pero al final decidí hacerlo por la garantía de 90 días, el equipo estéticamente se ve bien, si tiene un rayon en la pantalla pero no afecta hasta el momento su funcionamiento, de ahí en fuera todo está bien , batería al 100% de capacidad y no tiene piezas reesambladas, el único detalle fue ese rayón en la pantalla, lo seguiré probando respecto al funcionamiento y si llegara haber un detalle pues aplicaría mi garantía pero considero que calidad precio esta bien."
2641,"La verdad confiaba muy poco en los productos reconstruidos, pero me callaron. El iPhone que pedí llegó al siguiente día y sin ningún problema. Batería con vida de 90%, estética al 100%. Como es de suponer, el cable y cargador no son del celular, pero bueno unas por otras. Incluso el celular ya tenía una mica cristal, lo que me ahorró en comprarlo. Espero que todos tengan la misma suerte que yo, sino, vayan por la segura y compren uno nuevo"
2642,"El primero que compré lo devolví porque no leía ninguna sim card, lo devolví y luego compre compré por segunda ocasión y esta vez me enviaron uno en excelentes condiciones y con batería al 92%. Muy bueno"
2643,"El teléfono llego en perfecto estado estético !!, sin embargo con el paso de los días me di cuenta que la pila se encontraba en 90% y en menos de una semana bajo a 88%, el duplicar pantalla no funciona , no se porque no se conecta, y el Bluetooth no se conecta inmediatamente cuando subo al auto, siendo que ya está programado. Tengo mi sospecha de que los datos de internet en la calle no funcionan al 100 % porque de repente no tengo señal estando en un lugar en la ciudad ( por ejem. El estacionamiento del súper al aire libre ) no se tengo mis dudas si volveré a comprar este tipo de artículos en Amazon . Comprarlo es un volado o te sale excelente o trae sus detalles !!"
2644,"El producto NO es compatible con la B28, lo cual infringe la ley en México ya que todos los dispositivos vendidos aquí deben tener esta banda por ley, la parte de atrás y las cámaras venían en mal estado, estaba muy rayado además que tenía mucho desgaste, si no te importa mucho la estética este producto es para ti."
2645,"Al principio, era algo escéptico de comprar productos “reacondicionados” pero me di cuenta que es lo mejor que se puede hacer.1. ahorrar dinero2. Salvar a nuestro planetaYo creo que esas son las dos mejores razones. El celular llego con 100% de batería (habra que ver si sigue así) y estética perfecta, le pondria un 9.5/10 por que trae ligeros rayones, pero muy poco susceptible a la vista. Lo único que podría “criticar” es que el botón de apagado no hace “clic”, pero será cuestion de llevarlo a limpiar con algun técnico o algun reparador.100% convencido de mi compra, con BuySPRY."
2646,"Mi equipo vino con bastante uso y con un desgaste avanzado de la batería, 90 %. Equivalente a aproximadamente 1 año de uso.Vino con varios raspones pero fuera de eso, es un equipo funcional. Lo que no ayuda es su relación calidad - precio, que en mi caso, no fue tan buena como para otros compradores.Tuve que solicitar un reembolso."
2647,"Estaba nerviosa de comprarlo por ser un equipo reacondicionado, leí reseñas buenas y otras malas. Pero me anime por que tiene garantia de 90 dias y si algo no te gusta puedes regresar el equipo, eso me dio tranquilidad y para mi sorpresa el equipo llego muy bien y funciona super bien!!! Todos los botones sirven, el FaceID sirve y la pantalla viene intacta. Los únicos detalles que tiene son en los laterales y abajo (unos pequeños rasguños que muestro en mis fotos, pero la verdad ni se notan). Fue totalmente lo que esperaba. La batería tiene una vida del 83% (dura lo normal, lo que un iphone normalmente dura, lo cargo 1 vez al día o 2 si lo uso demasiado). Si algo sale mal o sigue estando bien, volveré en unos meses para poner una actualización e informarles como va mi equipo, llevo una semana con él"
2648,"Desde que llegó no detectaba el dedo y no podia hacer nada, pero hice la devolución sin ningun problema para poder comprar otro del mismo proveedor que me llegó y parecia nuevo, llevo vaios meses y no he tenido problemas. Te ahorras dinero pero si pasa algo te quedas con la duda de la procedencia del teléfono; creo que a la mayoría le va bien."
2649,"El equipo llegó bien protegido en buenas condiciones generales, no está rayado incluso traía una mica de cristal, solo tiene desgaste en una esquina pero nada grave a nivel estético.El problema más grande que le veo es la batería ya que llego con una condición de 84% Al ser reacondicionado es un detalle que podía pasar sin embargo creo que por el costo podría venir mejor.En mi caso no encontré uno nuevo por el buen fin, pero por 2000 pesos más si hubiera preferido uno nuevo mil veces"
2650,"Al ver otras opiniones tenía expectativas bajas, pero todo completamente bien. El teléfono no traía ni un solo golpe y quite la mica que traía para detectar rayones pero nada. Estéticamente el teléfono 10/10 después revise la condición de la batería y todo bien, ya que venía al 98%.Creo que tuve muy buena suerte, sobretodo por ls demás opiniones. Lo compré con BuySpry a 10K."
2651,"Excelente equipo, prácticamente como nuevo y llego rápido!!"
2652,"Buen iPhone, llego en mi caso algunos días antes de lo previsto, el equipo viene con batería al 84%, un pequeño rayón en el bisel y algunos arañazos profundos en pantalla (se disimulan con la mica), eso es lo que me pareció no Tan bueno, en las cosas buenas, vaya, es un iPhone, todo lo demás sumamente funcional y normal sin ningún problema, si recomiendo comprar por el precio al que lo conseguí, sugiero estar pendientes con las variaciones de precio y buscar el más bajo, le daría un 8.5 a la transacción en general"
2653,"I got first phone for my son, battery life was great but screen is not original and very fragile, he already has it cracked. I got another phone for myself from the same seller and package came very strange: phone wasn't erased, low battery life, no key to insert sim card. I was very disappointed and returned this phone. It was very difficult to return my phone as well because I had to pay to ship to back. Luckily Amazon covered my shipping but I'm not dealing with this seller again."
2654,"Llevo un poco más del mes con el iPhone y mi opinión tras es el uso es que llegó en buenas condiciones, estéticamente 9.5, tiene unos ligeros rayones en la pantalla y en la parte trasera marcas de uso de funda, pero aun así no es nada grave o que se note demasiado. En cuestión de la batería llegó con 91% de condición por lo que no está nada mal, en el tiempo que llevo con el todo le ha funcionado y no he tenido ningún problema , Face ID, llamadas y mensajes, cámaras, batería, no tiene pantalla genérica por lo que cheque, GPS, BT , todo bien, lo único que comentaría es que NO ESTA TOTALMENTE DESBLOQUEADO DE COMPAÑÍA como se dice, yo usaba mi compañía telefónica Bait y a la hora de insertar la SIM no la leyó, hasta que probé con Telcel y Movistar funcionó, tuve que cambiar de compañía para hacer uso del Celular que para mí no fue gran problema, pero se comenta por qué al menos el que me enviaron no era para cualquier compañía."
2655,Mal
2656,"Compré este modelo porque estaba en descuento con la duda de saber que me esperaría, me desilusiono un poco porque una de las cámaras tenía un golpe y se veia pequeños raspones en un borde del teléfono. Personalmente siempre utilizo mis celulares con fundas protectoras asi que por esa parte no tenia tanto problema. Fuera de eso el teléfono cumplió mis expectativas en todo. El porcentaje de bateria es de 98% sirven adecuadamente las camaras y el face ID. Si buscas un buen teléfono a precios accesibles este modelo lo cumple."
2657,"Es justo lo que prometen un celular renovado, que se ve bien y funciona bien. El mío solo vino con tres rayones muy pequeños en los laterales.  La pantalla sin ningún rayón y la batería al 100%. No se ve cuan exactitud cual fue el detalle o defecto que pudo haber tenido."
2658,"I bought this ogine a month ago, was working fine. Until just now it started completely zooming in the screen to the point where I can't do anything with the phone. It's currently stuck like that. I was told I have 90 day window to return and I want to return thus phone now!!!! I feel ripped off completely!!!!"
2659,"Ya con este van 3 los dispositivos que compro refurbished en amazon (diferentes vendedores) y siempre me han salido bien.Este llego de maravilla sin daño alguno (mas que un ligero rayon en una esquina pero ni se nota) todo funciona bien y hasta el cargador genérico llego bien, sin duda comprar en amazon es cuestión de seguridad y precio."
2660,"La carcasa con múltiples golpecitos. La pantalla sumamente rallada, le sobre pusieron una mica,para ocultar los rallones. Pero se la retire y o sorpresa. Para mí no vale lo que pagué. Así que va de regreso."
2661,"El celular me llegó al siguiente día, tal como lo indica la descripción y por ser un teléfono renovado no llego en caja original , ni con el cargador original y no trae audífonos, se siente y se ve como nuevo totalmente al checarlo en Apple indica que obviamente ya no tiene garantía ahí solo los tres meses con el vendedor !!!"
2662,"El teléfono funciona al 100 la parte trasera muy bien cuidada , pero la pantalla , esta demasiado rayada , entiendo que es renovado,  pero en la descripción dice que esta como nuevo y puedo aceptar algunos rayones,  pero tiene algunos rayones que resaltan a metros de distancia,  y son inaceptables"
2663,"Antes de comprarlo tenía muchas dudas ya que había cometarios buenos y malos, pero después de revisar en muchos lugares me decidí por Amazon. Llego rápido y antes de abrirlo tenía mucho miedo de lo que me iba a encontrar pero quedé impresionada, la estética estaba 10/10 batería al 100, la verdad no sé qué problema traía el cel antes porque sus condiciones están al 100 en todo ya que lo estuve probando estos días antes de hacer una review.Siento que esto es de suerte, a veces te puede tocar uno de mala calidad y otras veces uno excelente. En mi experiencia personal me tocó una excelente y volvería a arriesgarme a comprar uno así"
2664,"El producto llego con manchitas en una orilla del telefono muy poco visible pero era algo que yo estaba dispuesta a aceptar dado a que es reacondicionado, a demas de eso todo perfecto, capacidad maxima de la bateria de 92% camaras y el resto perfecto (solo ese detalle que es casi imperceptible) ya llevo usandolo aprox una semana y todo super bien, animense ya compramos otro equipo aqui mismo y llego excelente tambien!"
2665,"El primero que me llegó no detectaba el dedo, hice la devolución sin ningún problema, volví a comprar otro y parece nuevo, sin ningún rasguño me tocó la batería al 100% y no he tenido problemas hasta ahora (2 meses)."
2666,"El producto llego en perfectas condiciones y al revisarlo no se le cambio nada, todos sus componentes son originales.Me sorprendió que llego prácticamente nuevo, la batería tenía un 94% de vida y no hay un solo rasguño en la carcaza y pantalla.Ampliamente recomendable.Lo único que no me gusto es que el cubo y cable para cargar se ven de baja calidad, no los uso ya que tengo accesorios originales de otro iPhone que reemplace."
2667,"Pues nada llego con 94% de batira, y solo el vidrio de la parte trasera tenia rayones pequeños (tenia que acercarmelo a la cara para poder apreciarlos), contento con la compra y con el equipo (volvi a IOS despues de tantos años XD desde el 5s)"
2668,"En sí el producto se ve muy muy poco usado, me llegó con 99% del estado de la batería, los 256gb que pedí, hasta ahora ha funcionado con normalidad, el único detalle que me percaté fue que al ver otro iPhone 11 de un amigo (que se adquirió nuevo), lo sentí con más calidad en la pantalla, muy probablemente el que me dieron cuente con una pantalla genérica, no se ve taaaan mal, pero tengo que admitir que la sensación de la calidad de pantalla del otro iPhone me agradó muchísimo más…"
2669,"El producto es genial, le daría una calificación de 10"
2670,"Después de pensarlo mucho me decidí a adquirir este iPhone renovado, funciona súper bien, Lo único fue la batería que venía al 86% de su capacidad, aún así le dura bastante la pila, me dura casi todo el día, no traía ningún rayón o golpe, el Face ID Le funciona Perfecto. Trae un cargador y caja genérico como describe la publicación. Hasta ahora no ha fallado, lo recomiendo 👍🏼👍🏼"
2671,"Intuyo que la pantalla fue reemplazada, dado que encontré restos de pegamento.La pantalla se ve excelente, no tiene rayones, golpes, todo en excelente estado."
2672,"Compre el iPhone 11 rojo 64 GB a $11,100. El producto llegó en muy buenas condiciones con una batería útil de 92% en caja con cable y adaptador de corriente de carga rápida todo genérico pero útil.El producto estaba excelente estéticamente sin daños visibles, un poco sucia la cámara pero la limpié y funciona todo correcto.La considero una buena compra, sin embargo doy 4 estrellas por que en Amazon USA se puede comprar el mismo modelo por menos precio y con la opción de Renewed Premium, con el costo de envío y los costos de aduana sería más barato cerca de $500-$300 pesos mexicanos más barato al precio que lo adquirí. Recomiendo comprarlo ahí, sin embargo si no tienen tiempo o baja el precio está es una muy buena opción."
2673,It was easy to convert from my iPhone 6 to the 11. Phones mated and I changed the SIM card and Bingo everything worked. I was able to keep my current plan which was important to me. I think the price was fair and so I’m quite happy.
2674,"Llegó en tiempo y forma, buena presentación, pero al sacarlo del empaque veo que tienes dos rayones grandes en la pantalla que se notan desde lejos. También cuenta con una mancha blanca en una zona de la pantalla, que se nota demasiado al usar el tema blanco. Al usarlo y verificar estado de la batería está al 77% cuándo en la publicación menciona qur estará por arriba del 80%. No cumple con la descripción del producto, no esperaba que viniera cómo nuevo, pero tampoco tan descuidado y dañado."
2675,"Quand j'ai acheté ce téléphone, je m'attendais à recevoir un téléphone qui avait l'air usagé. J'ai été très surprise de constater qu'il est comme neuf: pas une égratignure, rien du tout! La pile a une charge maximale de 95%, ce qui est excellent."
2676,"Pros: Están a un precio bastante reducido a comparación a un equipo nuevo, (al menos el mio) parece como nuevo, no tiene absolutamente ningún defecto físico, tiene la batería al 100%, viene con mica, causa menos contaminación que un equipo nuevo.Contras: Viene con cargador genérico, y no viene con audífonos."
2677,Bought it and had keyboard glitchesTook forever to get after paid in full then took just as long to receive my refund.
2678,"Sin detalles esteticos, llega en caja muy bien cuidado, se ve que son equipos muy bien revisados, funcionalidad al 100%"
2679,"El producto llegó muy rápido y en perfectas condiciones, tiene detalles estéticos mínimos que en realidad lo hace ver como nuevo, sacado de una tienda de Apple. La carga de la batería al 100% y muy rápida con el cargador que incluía, la batería dura todo el día con constante uso. Vale mucho la pena por el precio en relación con el estado y la calidad de los productos que manejan. Lo recomiendo totalmente."
2680,"I bought this phone and there were no issues until I noticed the camera shutter noise not shutting off even when the silent mode is on and volume is at mute. I believe this is the case because it is manufactured in Japan and it is mandatory to have this shutter noise constantly on, but living in Canada where it isn't mandatory it is very irritating to me. I was disappointed that this was not specified in the description as this issue happens with not only the camera app but also third party apps like snapchat."
2681,Excelente telefono. Impecable sin ningún rayon no golpe. La batería con 100% de capacidad. Prácticamente nuevo!
2682,"El teléfono llego con algunos rayones en la parte trasera, pero con una funda eran invisibles. Llego con el 99% de batería, sin embargo, comencé a notar sobrecalentamiento usando redes sociales lo cual no es normal, al cabo de 1 semana el estado de la batería era de 96% asi que comencé el proceso de devolucion."
2683,"La verdad hice una buena inversión, mi celular es casi nuevo con solo un pequeño rasguño, no le falla absolutamente nada y la pila está al 100 de condicion. 100% recomendable"
2684,Venia con ligeros rayones . Que si son  muy poco visibles. O perceptiblesCon vida de la batería al 89%Lo que si venía sucio. Que al momento pensé que eran como golpes o tallones  fuertes. Pero no era así.No tiene problemas evidentes en la operación. Tengo una semana de uso .y hasta ahora va bienEl FACE ID funciona bien.
2685,"La verdad tenía mis dudas para comprar este cel pero el equipo llego en perfectas condiciones, el dispositivo no tiene golpes, solo pequeños rayones en la pantalla pero solo se notan si te acercas mucho, la batería llego con un 90% de condiciónSi compraras este cel checa los precios ya que constantemente cambia mucho, yo lo compre en 12,700 pero al día siguiente vi que estaba en 14,000"
2686,"No llego el teléfono, solo enviaron una caja con 2 accesorios. Fatal¡"
2687,"El celular llegó como se esperaba, todas las piezas estaban dentro y no tuve ningún inconveniente en ese aspecto, el producto no me convenció por la calidad, ya que si se ve bastante que es un celular de segundo uso la calidad en comparación con el precio no me pareció lo más adecuado, sin embargo la respuesta de devolución de Amazon fue muy buena y esta en trámite mi rembolso."
2688,"Funciona bien, la batería muy bien 97% lo malo…Me llegó con una ralla en la pantalla y un golpe en la cámara superior de atrás. Muy mal, no lo recomiendo…. Ya que corres riesgo Que no llegue bien el producto, o avisar que puede llegar con detalles. Ya que no publican una foto del iPhone exacto que te enviaran! O debería bajar el precio si saben que tienen detalles! para el precio deben de entregar la cosas en buen estado!"
2689,tristemente el cel que llego no le servia el tocuh..ahora lo estoy devolviendo.. y esperando la devolución..estaba muy emocionada al leer los otros comentarios que todo había salido bien...pero yo solo me llevo una mala experiencia..
2690,"Me espere 1 mes para dar mi opinión del producto después de probarlo, la verdad estoy súper contenta con esta compra, la estética 10/10, la vida de la batería es de 86 (la verdad muy buenos), ya venía con una mica de cristal templado así que solo me preocupe por la funda, todo funciona al 100%, nunca he sido fanatica de comprar productos renewed, la garantía de Amazon me animó un poco y fue la mejor compra!!!"
2691,"Muy buen producto, totalmente lo que esperaba!Tuve dudas de ingresar el producto a la garantía porque pedía IMEI. Si alguien sabe algo díganme!"
2692,"Initially, I was very hesitant to purchase a phone online, a renewed one for that matter. But this phone is practically just as good as new. Mine came with a 91 percent maximum capacity which was great and a huge relief! The packaging was quite okay and the delivery was fast as well. I just got it today so we'll still see how it goes but soo far soo good. Would definitely recommend! Definitely worth it!"
2693,"Bien con el celular, en precio y calidad, apenas con 1 mes y medio de uso, satisfecho por que ha respondido bien, sin ninguna falla del equipo hasta este momento. Recomendable"
2694,Me encantó. Definitivamente lo recomiendo. Ya le hice todas las pruebas para saber que funciona correctamente y esta de lujo. Me vino con un porcentaje de la batería del 92% realmente mejor de lo que esperaba. Sellado en su caja y sus cargadores genéricos.Realmente para el el precio increíble.
2695,"El teléfono me llego de un día para otro aunque me marcaba 4 dias de entrega, así que feliz de la rapidez, el teléfono esta a un 95% de estética unos pequeños arañazos en los marcos pero nada grave, la vida de la batería me llego con un 100%, hasta el momento funciona todo, bastante contento con la compra."
2696,"La verdad esperaba que llegara con algunos detalles estéticos o batería degradada, pero la verdad ha superado mis expectativas porque hasta cristal templado venía incluido, eso si hay que tomar en cuenta que los accesorios y la caja no son las originales pero el equipo si."
2697,So far so good I would buy another refurbished after this. Even though I was hesitant at first.
2698,"Al principio todo bien, hasta venía con mica.Casi un mes después, retiro la mica y veo que tiene demasiados rayones pequeños y unos 4 rayones que incluso parecen grietas, se notan hasta con la pantalla encendida"
2699,"Sencillamente me llevé una grata sorpresa al recibir el teléfono prácticamente nuevo; traía un simple roce en una orilla, pero apenas se nota; la batería es una joya, me llegó con 96 % de vida. Y en todas sus funciones ninguna falla. Llega en una caja genérica al igual que su cargador es genérico, pero venga, eso no es lo importante. Sin duda volveré a comprar «rea condicionado»."
2700,"Producto nuevo, la batería al 100% todo en excelente estado, prácticamente nuevo, los renewed de Amazon son muy buenos, no tuvo ningún problema y 80% más barato que en la tienda Apple, se los recomiendo mucho, más que un nuevo, se van a ahorrar mucho, eso si viene sin caja y con un cargador genérico."
2701,"Mi iPhone llego con una condición de batería del 91%, el cual esperaba más.Tiene detalles estéticos, con raspones en los lentes de las cámaras y en varias partes de alrededor del teléfono.El teléfono se caliente en la parte de atrás, no se si eso sea normal…En general el teléfono ha funcionado bien hasta la fecha, esperemos más adelante si continúa igual."
2702,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Plus viene cargador y mica lo malo es que no sirvió el speaker, el volumen del cel era demasiado bajo y la pantalla se veía China"
2703,El producto está en buenas condiciones sólo que trai de pila el 91 por ciento. Pero todo lo demás funciona al 100 y compre cargador aparte xq el que trae hace que se caliente el teléfono. Con el original hace que funcione sin problemas.
2704,"Llegó en caja genérica muy bien empacado, como si fuera nuevo, hasta le con plásticos de seguridad, los accesorios son de buena calidad. En estética diría que esta a un 95%, sólo tiene un Rayón de medio centímetro en la pantalla, en lo particular no me agrada, sin embargo no afecta en nada. La pila está a un 90%. El celular funciona perfectamente."
2705,El teléfono me llegó con la pantalla completamente rayada. Ya he procesado la devolución y el reembolso.
2706,"El iPhone no presentaba ni un solo rasguño en la parte trasera ni en la delantera, vino con un porcentaje de 83% en batería, solo tenía un pequeño detalle visible alrededor de la entrada del cargador pero nada de importancia, lo que me di cuenta días después fue que una de sus bocinas no funcionaba, pero aún así cuenta con un volumen y calidad de audio excelentes"
2707,"Este iPhone lo compre para regalo y llego con 100% de batería y ha funcionado correctamente, recomiendo al vendedor en atención para la factura, volvería a comprar con el"
2708,"Excelente producto muy recomendable, funciona a la perfección"
2709,"Viene con la pantalla rayada y la empresa le coloca una mica para ocultarlo, de ahí en fuera la estética del teléfono está bien, igual vino con 89% de condición de batería, no está mal pero pudo ser mejor, para futuros compradores tengan en cuenta que la pantalla puede venir rayada, yo había leído esto en comentarios pasados pero al menos está pasable."
2710,"Llego en excelentes condiciones, no tiene daños externos visibles, viene con una mica protectora y la batería venía al 100% de su capacidad. Me llegó unos días después de comprarlo y fue muy buena elección."
2711,El celular viene en condiciones óptimas para usar sin fallas hasta el momento de estética si tiene sus detalles de uso al ser un equipo refurbish sin embargo por el costo se compensa a uno nuevo.Solo detalles de raspones en los biceles laterales pero en pantalla y tapa trasera impecableMuy buen equipo sin fallas en batería y demásMe llego con el 96% condición de la batería y se me hace súper bien.
2712,"Para quienes quieren un buen teléfono y no les importa que sea seminuevo, sugiero revisarlo bien y usarlo en cuanto llega para probar el funcionamiento, mi familia ha comprado 3 y todos salieron buenos"
2713,"funciona bien, pero dice que no se notan los defectos a un brazo de distancia, pero el equipo que me llego cuenta con defectos considerables. tiene rayones en la pantalla (pequeños pero si se ven a un brazo de distancia), y la parte de atras esta un poco estrellada"
2714,"iPhone 11 showed up on time, screen had numerous scratches and a white cloudy circle on it.  The oleophobic coating was gone and the screen felt sticky.  The battery was at 82% remaining.  This phone was 20$ cheaper then a new iPhone 11.  I returned it and bought a phone from Apple."
2715,"Hasta el momento es un 10 súper ganado, me llegó con el 100% de pila y sin un solo raspón o problema en el hardware, de funcionamiento todo ha ido perfectoActualizaré con el paso del tiempo pero de momento estoy contento con la compra"
2716,"I saved a good chunck of money buying a refurbished phone and I’m glad I did. It feels and looks brand spanking new, even comes with a screen protector on it. Don’t waste your money on a new iPhone people."
2717,"Llegó en muy buen estado, parece nuevo, no tiene ninguna imperfección física ni rayón. Lo entregaron con mica protectora y todo. La batería estaba en una capacidad de 89% así que es buena para ser un equipo usado. Estoy muy conforme con mi compra y sobre todo con la relación calidad - precio creo que valió la pena."
2718,"El celular viene en estupendas condiciones, al 98% de batería de capacidad, sin rayones, a excepción de una sola marca de rayadura en una de las esquinas, pero no se le nota nada. Viene con un cargador y cable genérico, pero ambos funcionan perfectamente bien."
2719,"Funciona súper bien, lo único que tenia eran unas marcas de la funda anterior en los bordes, pero no tiene ningún rayón ni golpe. Dicen que la batería puede llegar hasta con el 80% pero me llegó con el 100% y aun sigue así, pensaba comprar el iPhone 12 pero por presupuesto compré el 11 y quedé totalmente satisfecho"
2720,"No me gustó que la pantalla estuviera muy rallada la cuál con la mica que viene no se ve hasta que se la quitas, y la batería venia al 88 % de capacidad , el procesador si es lo que se espera y la batería igual pero la pantalla venia muy mal"
2721,"Mala experiencia, el equipo lleno de golpes en el marco de metal, la pantalla tan rallada que ni con un protector se ocultaría y por el brillo no pareciera ser pantalla original, no volvería a comprar un teléfono por amazon"
2722,"Excelente compra! El equipo venía en perfectas condiciones, batería al 100%, mica frontal y ningún detalle ni rasguño exterior. Funciona perfecto y al mejor precio comparado con otras tiendas online o dispositivos usados. Lo recomiendo ampliamente!"
2723,El teléfono venía con rayones en la pantalla lo cual le pusieron una mica para que no se notara y venía 3 golpes que se notaron bastante en la parte superior derecha de el teléfono mis expectativas es que no llegará con bastantes defectos
2724,"A decir verdad tenía muchas dudas sobre si comprar o no este producto. Al final me animé y resultó una grata sorpresa, el producto venía sin ningún detalle, la batería venía al 100% y todo venía muy bien, como dice la publicación, incluye cargador genérico pero funcional."
2725,Overall the phone was ok but the major problem was that I would charge it one day and barely use it by the next day it would be dead. I suggest not to waste your money on this
2726,Nunca había comprado nada reacondicionado pero esta compra me sorprendio. Funciona todo a la perfección y está como nuevo.
2727,"El aparato llegó en excelentes condiciones, estéticamente le doy un 10. Funciona muy bn y hasta ahora no ha presentado ningún problema, llego con 100% en vida de la batería."
2728,"La estética al 99%, sin embargo una de las cámaras parece que no funciona bien, lástima que me di cuenta después de vencido el plazo de devolución"
2729,"Funciona y en perfectas condiciones, solo el cargador no es original, pero cargar bien y rápido me gusto mucho"
2730,"Tenía mis dudas ya que soy muy fan de la marca y nunca he comprado phone renovados, tengo el 11 morado y es pues con apple es garantía de buena calidad, andaba en busca de uno para mi hermana, y le ha encantado. Estética 10/10, lo único pues es la batería que ya venia con 92, eso es como si lo unieran usado al menos un año, pero fuera de eso, todo bien."
2731,"Lo único que no me gusto es que mandan cargador y cable genéricos, he comprado ya otros iphone reacondicionados y me llegan con cargador y cable original, fue el único detalle por lo demás bien"
2732,"Hasta ahora , me pareció una súper compra. Estética de 100, funciona a la perfección, buen rendimiento de batería. Superó mis espectativas y llegó al día siguiente que lo ordené."
2733,"Llevo 1 semana usándolo y cumple con lo que ofrece el vendedor, me llego con estética general de 98, muy cuidado y la batería al 88%Lo recomiendo solo a las personas que les interesa sacarlo a MSI com BBVA, ya que por el precio conviene uno nuevoAún así, fue mi primer compra en Amazon y me voy más que satisfecho"
2734,"El producto está bien y funciona a la perfección, solo que si tiene varios detalles, la pintura rayada en las esquinas y 2 rayones un poco visibles en la pantalla, cargador genérico que claramente no es de carga rápida, considero que puedes encontrar iPhones de mejor calidad en lugares de segunda mano."
2735,"Al principio tenia mis dudas sobre comprarlos, pero el teléfono llegó como si fuera nuevo, funciona al 100. Lo único que no te pero que ya había leído es que su batería está al 85%. En realidad es una súper compra, por el precio :)."
2736,Era para mi hija y lleva varias semanas usándolo  mucho y no ha dado problemas excelente producto
2737,"El empaque no es el mejor, el producto si es muy bueno, es caja genérica con cargador genérico, el cubo es terrible pero el cable vale la pena"
2738,"Me gusto que venía en muy buen estado, además de que lo empaquetan muy bien, me sorprendió, nunca había comprado Reacondicionado y sin duda lo volvería a hacer, además me regalo una mica, obvio los accesorios no son originales ni la caja pero eso ya lo especifican en su descripción así que todo bien"
2739,"La verdad había muchos comentarios al respecto, pero a mi me tocó la suerte de que el celular venía con una condición de pila del 98%, físicamente se veía intacto, todo me ha funcionado al 100% y venía con mica. La verdad el cargador si esta chafa no lo recomiendo usar diario, solo para emergencias."
2740,"Estéticamente el iphone lucia muy bien sin embargo no entiendo como pueden vender un equipo con una calidad de batería tan mala (78%) incluso mostraba mensaje para ser reemplazada, a los pocos dias dejo de funcionar (ya no encendió) así que decidí realizar la devolución y no he recibido mi reembolso"
2741,"Estoy muy satisfecho con la compra, vino con 98% del estado de la batería, y la estética es casi de la 10 ya que tiene unos pequeños puntitos blancos cerca de los botones, pero son impresentables a menos que te interesen mucho los detalles estéticos, además de que vino con una mica vidrio templado"
2742,"Hola, al conectarlo con los cables que vienen en la caja me dio una descarga eléctrica en la mano que sostenía el teléfono y no carga con cables.... solo inalámbrico.....muy mala compra"
2743,Muy bueno solamente un pequeño raspón en la cámara y la batería al 98 pero es entendible que sea un dispositivo de este estilo.
2744,"Algo trae mal este celular, se desconecta constantemente de mis EarPods y para cargar el equipo debo jugar el cable, como si estuviera flojo o haciendo un falso contacto. No modo, a devolverlo. La estética sí es muy buena, ni se ve que es usado"
2745,"Al principio con tantos comentarios buenos y malos me dio un poco de miedo pero mi teléfono me llegó sin ningún rayón, batería al 100% ,todo al 100 si no fuera por la caja y el cargador genérico diría que viene de tienda, al momento todo bien igual lo seguiré probando. Lo recomiendo 👍"
2746,"Fue una excelente compra! El teléfono está como nuevo, no tiene ni una sola falla. Llegó en una caja genérica, como dice la publicación, y con accesorios que no son Marca Apple pero son totalmente nuevos. Además llegó antes. Estoy muy satisfecho con la compra."
2747,"El teléfono llegó sin detalles estéticos, solo que no es compatible con compañías como pillofon, me cambie de AT&T y sin problemas. Su pila dura bastante tiempo. Buen producto por el precio."
2748,"AL principio dudaba mucho de comprarlo, ya que había comprando un equipo igual en otro lugar y salió muy mal, en cambio aquí el paquete bien sellado, la batería traía un 87% de vida, el equipo no vine con algún golpe estético.hasta el momento todo bien, seguiré informando."
2749,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   El producto llegó impecable tenia mis dudas porque comencé a leer los comentarios y las reseñas habia unas buenas y otras malas pero lo mejor de la historia es que soy del porcentaje del que no podemos quejarnos me llego en un excelente estado"
2750,Me llegó con la pantalla abierta en la parte de abajo y el auricular sucio. No lo recomiendo.
2751,"Llegó prácticamente nuevo, sin rasguños, todo funcional y batería con 100 de vida, tal cual la descripción es el producto."
2752,Para ser Reacondicionado está muy bien la vdd en cuestión física doy un 10 pero en cuestión de la batería deberían mejorarla a un 90% por lo menos
2753,El teléfono viene en perfectas condiciones pero viene con un cargador que no sirve adicionalmente arroja un mensaje que indica que no se puede identificar el estado de la batería … estamos probando a ver qué tal sigue funcionando
2754,Miren la verdad tenía miedo al comprarlo pero se ve que los que lo venden son técnicos calificados ya que el mío decía que la pila se estaba re calibrando y tenía 96 y se re calibró y saco el 100 % por ende yo creo que le cambias la pila 100 recomendado la verdad me gusto no tenía nada de golpes
2755,"Cuando lei algunos comentarios de malas experiencias pense que me llegaria un telefono muy usado y con alguna falla, pero no fue asi. El telefono tiene estetica 9/10, ninguna abolladura, funciona a la perfeccion. Eso si, llega con caja y cargador genericos"
2756,Buen producto casi nuevo bateria con un 94%
2757,"Tenía mis dudas si comprarlo, pero lo recibí muy rápido sin detalles y funciona súper bien, además de que llegó con una mica protectora incluida muy bueno"
2758,"Es algo que ya me lo venía venir, sooo puedo decir que estoy satisfecho de verdad el cel está al 100%, todo perfecto literal esta nuevo, recomiendo demasiado este vendedor !💪🏻"
2759,"La verdad es que me sorprendió mucho que el teléfono está casi 100% como nuevo, solo tiene la batería al 93% y un ligero rasguño en el área de las cámaras, pero por el precio siento que lo vale totalmente"
2760,"Tuve que regresar el artículo, hacia un ruido raro y vibraba continuamente cada vez que abría la cámara... Por lo que leí, está relacionado con el estabilizador de la cámara ."
2761,Funciona perfecto
2762,"Para el precio que tenía, me pareció que cumple, batería al 88%, y solamente me lamento de no haber esperado que bajara más el precio jaja, con un precio menor, sí estaríamos hablando de una excelentísima relación calidad-precio. Muy recomendable, puede que les toque uno en mejores condiciones."
2763,"El teléfono viene en muy mal estado. Con demasiados golpes en los lados, y muy rayada la parte de atrás. Además la batería ya viene con calidad de menos del 90%, y se calienta en extremo el teléfono sin hacer mucho uso de él."
2764,Delighted with this purchase which arrived within 3 days.The phone itself is in great condition and transfer from my old phone was quick and easy.Everything is working really well and looks like new!
2765,No me gusto lo que recibi por que la pantalla  estaba muy rallada y tenía pixels muertos que en un año de podría expandir y no sería functional es por eso que regrese el producto y estoy en espera de mi reembolso que espero sea en su totalidad.
2766,"Llegó bien, tiene el 100% de vida de la batería y estéticamente impecable. Lo único malo es que me llegó una versión que no soporta la banda B28 por lo que no sería compatible con Altan. Pero para Telcel, AT&T o Movistar sin problema."
2767,"En general, muy bien empaquetado, el telefono al 99% estetico, funcionamiento hasta el momento no he tenido fallas, solo la bateria estaba al 86%, pero por el precio esta bien. Lo recomiendo, llevo un mes con el y sin problema."
2768,A mi hija le encantó pues el color es muy femenino y de buen gusto
2769,"El teléfono me llegó con batería al 100% no tiene ningún golpe ni rayón; me llegó como nuevo. No viene en su caja original, tampoco incluye audífonos, solo cargador genérico. Estoy muy feliz con la compra y hasta el momento no le falla nada."
2770,"En la descripción detalla perfectamente lo que te mandan, el equipo llego en buen estado, bien cuidado, es original y los accesorios que dan son genéricos al igual que la caja, recomiendo infinita mente el vendedor y este tipo de artículos."
2771,Producto USADO.1-. Pantalla Rayalla.2-. Raspado y con golpes.3-. No tiene garantia con el fabricante.4-. Cargador y cable No originales (Genericos)No lo recomiendo.
2772,"El producto me llegó en muy buenas condiciones, el celular no tiene ni un rayón. La única diferencia contra uno nuevo es que llegó con capacidad de batería del 86% pero por el precio y la excelente condición con la que llegó el iPhone creo que estoy más que satisfecho"
2773,El que me llegó viene intacto y me llegó con el 100% de bateríaLlegó en excelentes condiciones y en funcionamiento no he tenido ningún problema.Super recomendado.
2774,"très déçue, tout fonctionnais correctement, pour environ 2 semaine et demie, puis l'écran a juste arrêter d'être tactile complètement"
2775,"Compre este teléfono hace más o menos un mes, y la verdad es que se veía nuevo totalmente, no tenía ni un rasguño y la batería era del 100%. Hasta el momento no he tenido algún problema. Estoy muy contenta con mi compra."
2776,The camera quality is amazing and there aren’t any scratches on the phone. Arrived much earlier than expected and came with a charger.
2777,"El teléfono me llegó con varios raspones y con 77% de pila. En la descripción te aseguran 80% o más. Un phone nuevo está en $13,000, entonces por $1,500 no vale la pena el riesgo de que te llegue con una pila devastada."
2778,Good value. Was cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else.
2779,"Estaba un tanto nervioso acerca de mi compra de un iPhone renovado. Sin embargo, ha venido sin ningún detalle estético, funciona perfectamente, y además tiene protector de pantalla. Totalmente recomendado."
2780,Came with screen protector on already. Not eligible for icare. Clean phone. Overall happy with it.
2781,"El equipo me llegó con 98% de batería, y un mini mini rayón imperceptible a simple vista casi con lupa se ve, lo demás equipo al 100, el cubo de carga de materiales no de 1ª pero muy funcional"
2782,"Muy bonito el celular, buena calidad, precio muy bien, batería si muy rendidora estoy muy contenta gracias"
2783,"El teléfono llego en tiempo y forma, está en exelente estado, la pila llego en condición al 100% lii ok bunico que no me gusto son unos arañazos en el DisplayY para ocultarlo lo mandaron con la mica templada ya instalada."
2784,Me gustó mucho. Únicamente tiene un pequeño detalle que se observa como mancha obscura en un costado. Casi imperceptible y no parece afectar en las funciones del móvil ni la pantalla como tal.
2785,"Tenía mis dudas pero quedé encantada, funciona al 100, sin detalles una de mis mejores compras sin duda"
2786,"Me llego completamente nuevo a excepción del cargador que es generico, con pila del 92%, todo excelente llevo 4 días con él y me parece una maravilla, lo recomiendo mucho y ojalá les toque la misma suerte como a mi :)."
2787,"Una de las mejores compras que he hecho en amazon. El teléfono llegó como nuevo, no me ha dado ninguna falla. Venia en una caja de amazon y con el cuadrito del cargador genérico pero todo perfecto."
2788,"Mala calidad precio- Producto. Descripción y publicidad engañosa, entiendo que por el precio, no puede uno exigir algo de mejor calidad. Pero consideró la descripción de producto no es la adecuada y correcta"
2789,The phone was shipped with no software installed and could it be used. I received it in  restore mode and could not be used. I had to send it back as it could not be restored on several Macs. Extremely dissapointed.

2794,"El equipo llegó increíble sin problemas alPaso de dos semanas la pantalla se obscurecio, hice efectiva la garantía de Amazon y todo bien, me tocó la de malas de que surgiera ese detalle"
2795,Me gustó que llego antes del tiempo estimado.... En super buenas condiciones de entrega.... Superó mis espectativas!!!!
2796,"He comprado otros iPhone (renew) en Amazon y este no traía lo mínimo que mencionan las condiciones. No traía para cargarlo ni la llave para meter el chip, por eso decidí regresarlo"
2797,"Llegó mejor de lo que esperaba, con Mica inclusive. Funciona todo correctamente y prácticamente como nuevo fisicamente."
2798,"Le encantó a mi hija este iphone 11 y ni hablar de la pila que llegó al 100, y el celular impecable, lo único malo es que viene con cargador en color negro el cual está feo!, 😎👍"
2799,"El mío llegó con la pantalla muy rallada y la batería al 86% el cargador no funcionaba, solicité la devolución."
2800,"Para ser reacondicionado solo tiene dos micro rayones, nada grave ni notorio.Solo la pila llego al 83% eso no me gusto, me parece muy poco, de ahí en mas todo esta perfecto."
2801,Muy mal equipo seMe apago a los dosMeses y  loLleve a revisar y está malLa tarjeta lógica

2804,"La verdad me llego en un muy buen estado, batería al 100%, ningún detalle estético y todo funcionado al 100, la verdad es que lo recomiendo bastante"
2805,"Despues de ocupar el celular 4 meses, no me empezo a recnocer el FACE ID, intente todas las soluciones hasta restaurarlo de fabrica. No lo recomiendo."
